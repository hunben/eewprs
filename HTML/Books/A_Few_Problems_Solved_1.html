<a name="1..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The real significance of the word Sa&#x301;hitya or &ldquo;literature&rdquo; is inherent in the word itself, for the characteristic of literature is &ldquo;to move together,&rdquo; keeping abreast of the trends of life. Literature is no invention of the superficiality of social life, nor is it the colourful spell of any fantasia. Rather it is the portrait of real life &ndash; an external expression of the internal recesses of the mind &ndash; a bold and powerful expression of the suppressed sighs of the human heart. In order to preserve the sanctity and prestige of its name, literature must maintain its rhythm in pace with the dynamic currents of society.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The word Sa&#x301;hitya can be interpreted in another way as well: sa + hita = hitena saha; &ldquo;that which co-exists with hita or &lsquo;welfare.&rsquo;&rdquo; Where there is no inner spirit of welfare, we cannot use the term Sa&#x301;hitya. The creations or compositions of those who proclaim that &ldquo;Art is for art&#146;s sake,&rdquo; cannot be treated as Sa&#x301;hitya. Indeed, that welfare which pertains to the mundane world is relative; its definition also may change according to the changes in time, place and person. But that aspect of the term hita which leads human beings to the absolute truth is one and the same for all ages and all countries.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->In order to communicate with people at different states of development, and of different ideas, the same concept of welfare has to be expressed through different branches of knowledge. The grand, benevolent flow of ideas, with the common people on one side, and the state of Supreme Bliss on the other &ndash; this is called literature; for in every particle, in every rhythmic expression of this very benevolent thought process, the Supreme Bliss is lying dormant.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Thus &ldquo;literature&rdquo; is that which moves together with the society, which leads society towards true fulfilment and welfare by providing the inspiration for service. The statement &ldquo;Art for art&#146;s sake&rdquo; is not acceptable; rather it is better to say, &ldquo;Art for service and blessedness.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->In every expression, in every stratum of this universe, however crude or subtle, only one refrain prevails, and that refrain is the attainment of bliss. In that artistic movement towards welfare both the attainment and the bestowal of happiness find simultaneous expression. When litterateurs dedicate themselves to the service or sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; of literature, they have to let their creative genius flow in this very current: they have to cleanse all that is turbid, all that is inauspicious in individual life in the holy waters of their universal mentality, and then convey it sweetly and gracefully into the heart of humanity. Herein lies the fulfilment of their service, the consummation of their sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->If the sweet, benevolent sentiment of individual life fails to inspire collective life, we cannot consider such a creation as art. Those who are unwilling or unable to create Sa&#x301;hitya as a means of service and sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, should not try to place the blame on the collective mind, hiding their own impure thoughts behind their grandiloquence and bluster. Let them not claim that they are simply painting the picture of society, that this portrayal alone is their sole charge &ndash; that society will find its own direction under force of circumstances. By the touchstone of judgement such so-called litterateurs should be termed literature-dealers or pot-boilers, instead of cultivators of literature, for they are not moving along the path of benevolence. With the eyes of traders, they look upon society as the buyers of their books.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..7"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->The Responsibility of a Litterateur<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->The aim of artistic creation is to impart joy and bliss. The bestowers of this bliss, the servers of the people, cannot keep their daily lives aloof from commonplace events, mingled with pleasures and pains, smiles and tears. The children of the soil of this earth are those with whom literature must remain inseparably associated &ndash; and the litterateur is also one of them.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->People seek deliverance from the whirlpools of darkness; they aspire to illuminate their lives and minds with ever-new light. In all their actions, in all their feelings, there is an inherent tendency to move forward; therefore, if at all they are to be offered something, the creator of art cannot remain idle or inert.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Yet human beings on their journey through life may sometimes stop short in fear or apprehension. Sometimes their knees give way and they sit down fatigued and frustrated. At such times the responsibility of the gifted litterateur becomes all the more significant. And when the litterateurs sing their songs of forward movement, they have to be very cautious about one more thing: after every artistic creation they must look back carefully to determine whether those for whom they have sung their marching songs are capable of moving forward with them &ndash; whether their thought-waves are touching the cores of the people&#146;s hearts &ndash; whether their service is really doing good to them. In the literary world, the garland of glory goes only to those who are ever-aware of their responsibilities as litterateurs.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Real litterateurs are not only the beacons of the present, they are also the minstrels of the past and the messengers of the future. They are capable of providing proper leadership for the future only after grasping the relational flow between the past and the present. Past, present and future must become beautifully interwoven in their compositions: only dreaming of a bright future will not suffice. One must remember that all the potentialities of the future lie embedded as seeds in the womb of the present, just as the blossoms of the present were sown in the past. So artists should not only give a flawless portrayal of the present with their creative talent, but they should also continue to explore the possibilities of the future with a benevolent mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Whatever the possibilities the litterateurs present to the world from time to time, they should be exhibited as the healthy outcome of the present. In presenting these possibilities, their natural consequences should also be explained perfectly and flawlessly. The relation between the present and the future must be properly portrayed by presenting every stage of cause and effect. The natural resultant of any cause (Ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a) is known as its effect (Ka&#x301;rya) at a particular time or place or to a particular person. This should never be lost sight of even for a moment, because it is the intermediate link between these two, cause and effect, that leads people to intimate and cordial contact with the purpose of the writer. In the absence of this cordial affinity, in the absence of this dynamic unity, readers cannot accept any literary composition as their own. Whatever we may call the writers of such compositions which have no relationship with the collective psychology, we certainly cannot call them litterateurs. At best we may call their writings compositions, but certainly not Sa&#x301;hitya or literature.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..13"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Epochal Literature and Coastal Literature<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->As already mentioned, marching together with the thought of benevolence is termed Sa&#x301;hitya. That literature which cherishes the thought of benevolence but, without having snapped its relationship with us completely, is moving so far ahead in its march that it is no longer together with us, is called Tat&#x301;astha Sa&#x301;hitya or Coastal Literature, not Yuga Sa&#x301;hitya or Epochal Literature. Although it is not directly with us, it is never far. As this category of literature is ahead of its time, it is longer-lasting than Epochal Literature, but it is less significant in fulfilling the needs of a particular era. The outstanding characteristic of Epochal Literature is that it expresses in clear terms the demands of a particular era &ndash; it moves hand in hand with the collective psychology. It conveys in the language of the time every large or small, important or unimportant matter of the human mind, afflicted with the problems of that age. If this Epochal Literature, which is created expressly to fulfil the needs of the era, becomes more dynamic than the people of the age, despite its sincere and benevolent intent, then it loses its characteristic of moving together &ndash; and in fact it loses all its value. Such literature cannot earn its reputation like the Coastal Literature, and thus all the dreams of the litterateur end in frustration and failure. Good literature, in order to fulfil the demands of the time, must move in unison with society, keeping control over its speed. The litterateurs may move a step or two ahead, for they are the guides of society; but they should not move too far forward, and, of course, moving backwards is out of the question.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Movement is the characteristic of life, and so everything must move. Those who have lost their inherent dynamism are indeed dead. The right of preserving, building and rebuilding society is the duty only of those who are moving, not of those who are motionless, who are dead. Litterateurs cannot fling humanity into the stagnancy of death, for in this there is no thought of benevolence. So moving together with the people they will continue to sing their marching songs &ndash; they will go on filling the human mind with the sweet nectar of eternal life.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..16"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->The Litterateur as the Seer of Truth<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->The majority of what is termed Sa&#x301;hitya in the world today is mere composition, not literature. Litterateurs must prove their sense of responsibility through every line of their pens. Command over language and ideas is not sufficient. Something more is needed: the power to delve deeply into any matter &ndash; the earnest effort to identify the mind with the minds of all, to penetrate into the essence of truth (Tattvadarshii). Those who, possessed with a little superficial knowledge of life, are mere jugglers of language, cannot produce ideal literature. In the language of the Vedas a litterateur is called Kavi or seer of truth. Only such seers can create true literature; for the task of a litterateur is to hint at the future, and the ability to look into the future belongs to the seers of truth alone.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Those who think that their only responsibility is to portray the past, present or future are not litterateurs, for the mastery over these three dimensions of time is determined by the power to link all the three. Those who cannot assimilate this internal link can never establish the proper relation between the past and the present, or between the present and the future; none of their portrayals of past, present or future are capable of finding complete expression. Therefore, as I have said above, it is better to call these writers mere authors, instead of litterateurs. It is such authors who indulge in such utterances as &ldquo;Art for art&#146;s sake.&rdquo; A little examination will reveal the harmful influence of this idea on human society.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->The world is the thought projection of the Cosmic Mind, and so there is no question of any pause, even for a moment, in this eternal flow. Whether humans may desire it or not, society will have to move forward through ceaseless environmental changes. Literature is the psychic expression of this dynamism of humanity. It is for this dynamic humanity that literature has been created, and so it cannot be static, nor shall it ever become static. [[The thought-provoking factors that underlie the social picture created by the brush of the artist, that underlie the current of thoughts expressed by the litterateur, change, and so the artist and the litterateur should always work keeping a vigilant eye on those changing factors.]] Although the momentum of society depends on various factors, it is largely determined by psychological and cultural transformations.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..20"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Psychic Transformation<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->Although changes in mental outlook are a natural phenomenon, yet such changes do not take place in the same way at all times: in the past, they were different from the changes at present, and in the future they will be even more different. To meet the various necessities of this practical world, human beings must throw themselves into the task of solving their mundane problems, and in this endeavour the speed of the mind moves sometimes slowly, and sometimes fast. The psychic speed of human beings about ten thousand years ago was certainly much greater than it was about a million years ago, when Homo Sapiens just appeared on this earth. The primitive mind used to move at quite a slow speed: for generations together primitive people used to pass their days in the same environment, solving the same types of problems. For tens of thousands of years, they subsisted on shrubs and weeds and used stone tools and weapons; such was the standard of their civilization. Thereafter came the period of eating animal flesh, and it took those ancient humans about two or three hundred thousand years to accustom themselves to this new habit. After the discovery of fire, even the use of salt on roasted meat was not learnt very easily.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->But today, when we look back and examine the period from ten thousand years ago to five thousand years ago, we find that the speed of human progress has greatly accelerated. At intervals of every two or three hundred years some new discoveries were made. As a result of facing ever newer challenges, the human mind underwent revolutionary changes: animal husbandry gave way to agriculture, and dispersed communities evolved into a more compact society. Yet we do not find anywhere in the period between ten thousand years ago and five thousand years ago a well-knit social order, although we do find comprehensive efforts for social construction. In the Vedas there is a vague picture of the varied advancements made during the past five thousand years which, in view of the present, cannot be called rapid progress. The Vedas are the literary reflection of the psychic characteristics of that period. Yet in that age, when rays of light gradually pierced the darkness, people began to realize the necessity of moving more rapidly in unison. In some of the mantras and hymns of the Vedas, particularly in the Sam&#x301;gacchadhvam mantra, the seed of this very collective dynamism was sown.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->The old world passed away, yielding to the new, and the speed of social momentum was greatly increased. Even before the historically famous Buddhist era, well-constructed and dynamic societies had evolved in China and Egypt, yet the dynamism of these societies cannot be regarded as the second stage of progress; because in spite of the fact that they were post-Vedic civilizations, they were in fact part of that Vedic civilization, although with intrinsically distinctive characteristics.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->The society of the Buddhist era quickened the progressive rhythm of the Vedic era. The Vedic social system, caught in the midst of various clashes and counter-clashes, had reached the stage of inaction and stagnation. The Buddhist era imparted new dynamism to the feeble, faltering steps of the Vedic era by awakening new vigour and impetus for advancement, and thus accelerating the progressive momentum of humanity far more than even the Vedic era. That is why in the literature of this era we find a more constructive, vibrant social picture as compared to the literature of the Vedic era.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->The greater the clashes in human life, the faster the speed of the human mind because of circumstantial pressures. Due to the complexities of life and the plethora of problems over the last two centuries, the progress of society has gained unusual momentum. Whether or not one likes this progress, it has developed naturally, and will continue to do so. The momentum of the last two world wars has been dragging the society forcibly forward, as though human beings have become madly restless to triumph over time. Due to their hyper-speed, humanity&#146;s forward march has been losing its balance: while achieving success on the one hand, it faces grim failures on the other. This flagrant frustration is glaringly manifest in every line of post-war literature &ndash; there is not a spark of bold vision anywhere. With the capital of these frustrations and failures, litterateurs busily engage themselves in earning money. It is as if humanity is bent upon negating all the traditions of the four-centuries-old Maun&#x32D;galakavya<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.1.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#1.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->, the time-honoured Rama&#x301;yan&#x301;a and the Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata, the revered poets like Shakespeare, Milton, Vidya&#x301;pati and Can&#x301;d&#x301;ida&#x301;sa, and those works which championed both the learned and the illiterate like the Ra&#x301;macaritama&#x301;nasa. Although contemporary society is moving with increasing speed, it is incapable of preserving its balance. Litterateurs have been expressing this imbalanced state with their pens and thus conveying to their readers that they, too, are part of this unbalanced flow.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..26"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->Cultural Evolution<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->Cultural evolution has also brought about, and is continuing to bring about, a considerable change in society. This change is taking place more or less uniformly in almost all the countries of the world. Cultural evolution cannot be considered bad, for although defects in some societies are infecting others, yet even this interrelation has an immensely positive aspect: for the human race, knowingly or unknowingly, is gradually building a new human culture through mutual cooperation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->The different expressions of life are termed culture. The more the mutual contact and exchange of ideas between peoples of different countries, the closer people come to one another in the cultural sphere. The old, worn-out walls of literary tradition are in many places crumbling and in other places have been smashed to smithereens. As a result a new kind of international literature is evolving, and this is certainly an auspicious augury for the future. But even these auspicious developments which result from natural clashes and counter-clashes may eventually end in frustration and failure due to humanity&#146;s folly. In the absence of honesty, simplicity, spiritedness and genuine human love, internationalism may remain limited to the litterateur&#146;s caprice. The harshness of reality may not be tolerable to the litterateur. Thus we cannot surrender human destiny to the whims of the litterateur. Litterateurs must not remain intoxicated with the colourful spell of their imaginations, nor should they drive humanity to despair by constantly harping on the failures of the practical world, or singing the songs of frustration. Litterateurs must be closely attuned to the changes in both the psychological trends and the cultural evolution which remould the social structure. Not only the litterateurs, but all the creators of art should wield their pens or brushes with a synthetic outlook. If the artist or the litterateur does not do that, we must conclude that their artistic talents have degenerated. In fact, their contributions are then nothing but rubbish which may be fit for manure, but if dumped nearby becomes hazardous to public health. Artistic endeavour may be justified only when it results in the all-round development of society. If the litterateur&#146;s inspiration propels the social movement in a particular direction, denying all other aspects of society, then in that case we cannot call it literature, because there is no real sentiment of benevolence behind that creation. The flow of ideas that are not complete in themselves are never capable of leading practical life towards fulfilment and perfection.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..29"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->Struggle Against Obstacles<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->So real artists or litterateurs before wielding their brushes or pens, should understand clearly in which way the society is moving and why it is moving in that direction &ndash; what are the fundamental causes of its inherent weakness &ndash; and from which doctrines the depraved propensities which are infecting the society emanate. And merely understanding will not suffice: the artists may have to resist the surging current of destruction single-handedly.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="1..32"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->[If none to my call pays heed,<br>Then alone must I proceed.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->While keeping this very refrain in mind, they must continue in their relentless effort to fight against the seemingly indomitable might of hundreds and thousands of obstacles which are deeply rooted in age-old superstitions that are firmly entrenched in petty selfishness. Their pens may perhaps break into pieces, their brushes may perhaps be compelled to draw only lines of water on the canvas, and their histrionic flows may perhaps end in sheer mute stances, yet their efforts shall brook no pause. Each of their petty defeats shall be strung together as pearls in the garland of victory.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->When the society spins for age after age in the mirey eddies of evil and vice, when individual and collective knavery masquerades as intelligence, when hypocrisy, bribery and fraud are the yardsticks of ability for leadership &ndash; it is then that the genuine followers of Bha&#x301;ratii (the goddess of learning) must struggle through constant humiliation. Only taunts and insults will be their fate. Those who are afraid of these insults are incapable of offering anything really lasting to humanity. How can those persons who have no moral firmness, under whose feet the soil is not hard and strong, impart happiness to anyone with a cool, refreshing shelter? It is perhaps possible to drag on in life by sucking the blood of others like social parasites, but this will not bring fulfilment to either the litterateurs or to their readers.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->The artist or litterateur who assumes the responsibility of leading humanity to the path of light from the caverns of darkness will have to heed the road signs of that path. It is not possible to guide others merely with cheap, superficial knowledge, like a half-baked pandit who reads a half-a-dozen books and then spouts a few mouthfuls of grandiloquence, and who has obtained a doctorate degree by plagiarising others&#146; works. Rather it is necessary to have a keen and vigorous insight, without which all the endeavours of a litterateur or an artist will prove fruitless. Mere jugglery of words or depiction of defects in society will not satisfy the hunger of the human mind &ndash; and such creations of art are indeed valueless for social progress as well. One must know the path, and one must also know how to move on it. If those who have not comprehended what the form of the society will be allow the trends of the past that have shaped the present to proceed unchecked, then they can never lead the society to the path of perfection. They will indeed thrust the society into darkness in the name of social reform: they will encourage license in the name of freedom. Instead of modelling a woman after the ideal of a goddess, rather they mould the image of the goddess after the ideal of a harlot.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..36"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph -->Intimate Relation with the People<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..37"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=37 type=paragraph -->Litterateurs are epoch-makers and so they are the rs&#x301;is (sages) and kavis (seers) of the society. They cannot afford to forget their dignified calling even for a moment. They are the messengers of the mute masses &ndash; the guardians of the society. The slightest mistake on their part may result in catastrophe, and even a bit of caution may open up many new possibilities. So a person whose thought and expression are not restrained, had better not meddle with the practice of art. I have just said that it is through the coordination of psychological and cultural trends that literature proves its worth. Intellectual trends and cultural evolution cannot exist by themselves, disregarding the individual or humanity as a whole, for both intellectual and cultural developments concern humanity. And humanity does not mean merely a few favoured persons in the upper stratum of society, like the special delicacies placed on top of the pile of rice offerings to the gods in the temples. Rather humanity means those very people who, like the pile of rice, have borne the weight of those delicacies on their heads. Actually in the proper sociological perspective, those special delicacies should not represent any particular elite person or persons at the peak of society; rather they should be regarded as the combined expression of the collective mind. The artists who guide that collective expression towards more and subtle forms, will have to maintain an intimate relation with the psychological and cultural structures of the people, with the innate characteristic (pra&#x301;n&#x301;a dharma) of their existence. They must not disregard or neglect them even for a moment. If the artists remain preoccupied in floating like balloons in the sky while forgetting the people of the soil, all their creations will end in smoke after a mere momentary flash before the eyes. Their writings will not make any lasting impression on the pages of time.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="1..39"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=39 type=paragraph -->When changes in the society are somewhat accelerated due to various intellectual or cultural causes, then those creations that come into being in the aftermath of a particular situation are certainly fit to be called literature; but this sort of literature loses its practical value in later stages due to the rapid changes in society. Yet those who think that this sort of Epochal Literature will become valueless in time are also wrong, for this literature will not only be recorded in the pages of history, it will also carry special value for the litterateurs of the future, because from it they will get an inkling of the social trend of that particular period. Those who scorn Epochal Literature should know that all the sweetness of the Coastal Literature is inherent in the many forms, in the richness of thought, of this Epochal Literature. The endeavour of the artist of the era (yuga shilpii) alone can resist a powerful degeneration or a great catastrophe. There the creators of Coastal Literature are only mute spectators. They will continue to interpret morality, but their ability to awaken the spirit of dynamic heroism is considerably limited. The creator of Epochal Literature goes on constructing the road by excavating earth and shattering rocks and stones, while the Coastal Litterateur, perched on the summit of a mountain, goes on making sketches of that very scene and at intervals explains the science of building roads.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..40"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=40 type=paragraph -->With the increase in society&#146;s dynamism, the duration of effectiveness of Epochal Literature decreases. By the pressure of speed it becomes exhausted within a very short time. But in this there is no cause for regret; because the very task of building the road continues, and its relationship with Coastal Literature also remains intact. Epochal Literature is mainly concerned with time, place and person: so if there is the slightest increase in the attempt to triumph over any one of these three relative factors for whatever reason, the speed of the society as well as of the Epochal Literature gets accelerated; whereas Coastal Literature, in spite of maintaining these relative factors within its scope, does not confine itself in their rhythmic movement. That is why the momentum of Coastal Literature is extremely vague &ndash; almost motionless and static &ndash; and thus we call it Tat&#x301;astha or Coastal. The absolute truth is beyond the scope of time, space or person and also beyond expression, and thus it is not possible to create any literature at all around it. But the golden line with which this absolute truth has united the unit mind, originating from the relative factors of time, space and person, with its eternal soul &ndash; that much, at least, which we can express to some extent with language of our heart &ndash; this is what is called Tat&#x301;astha Sa&#x301;hitya or Coastal Literature. The line which is neither river nor shore but is touching both is tat&#x301;a or coast. Standing on this coast, that which maintains the relation between the two, between the temporal and the eternal, is called tat&#x301;astha.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="1..42"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=42 type=paragraph -->If we call the creator of the Epochal Literature a sage (rs&#x301;i), then we shall call the creator of the Coastal Literature a seer (kavi). The sage goes on establishing coordination and adjustment, stage by stage, among time, space and person, and the seer goes on establishing contact between time, space and person and the Entity which transcends all of them. Epochal Literature will give expression to the minute details of common people&#146;s daily lives &ndash; their hopes and aspirations, sorrows and joys &ndash; through the medium of language that will easily touch their hearts. That is to say, the creator of Epochal Literature will have to give maximum importance to the people&#146;s popular language. But if the people&#146;s language is not given much importance in Coastal Literature, it will not cause much inconvenience. If Tulsida&#x301;sa in his Ra&#x301;macharita Ma&#x301;nasa and Can&#x301;d&#x301;iida&#x301;sa in his Pada&#x301;valii had used the then scholarly Sam&#x301;skrta language, could they have wielded so much influence over the people? Similarly, the popular language of any part of the world as a vehicle of Epochal Literature does not carry very much weight in another part of the world, or with people speaking another language. There are quite a number of well-written English and Bengali books about the history and culture of Rajasthan, but how much can the people of Rajasthan, speaking Rajasthani language, be benefited by them? Perhaps the poetic genius of Michael Madhusudhan Dutt could have produced remarkable English compositions, but the marked extent to which his genius found expression in the Bengali language, the way a wonderful Epochal Literature came into being &ndash; perhaps could not have been achieved in the English language. It is not that Epochal Literature has to be written in the popular language alone, but the litterateurs should write their compositions in their own mother-tongues as much as possible.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..43"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=43 type=paragraph -->I have already said that the demand for popular language, however, is not so very strong or rigid in respect to Coastal Literature. I see no reason to be unduly concerned if books about any subtle theory or principle, or any complicated sciences, are written only in the principal languages of the world, for if they are written in the popular local language, there would be only a few who could study them. But then I would say that those litterateurs who think that their works will be less in demand if produced in their local languages, and thus instead create literature in the more widely known languages, cannot be called true litterateurs, for they lack the mentality of moving together with all. Rather it will be more proper to call such writers pot-boilers or literary traders.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="1..45"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=45 type=paragraph -->It is through clashes that power finds expression. In a life which is averse to fight &ndash; where the urge for fight is feeble &ndash; there life&#146;s expression also remains vague and indistinct. Human intellect is indeed awakened through various kinds of natural, social, psychic and economic struggles. Those who seek the awakening of their intellects should not be afraid of struggle. Each of the social, economic and psychological principles of human life keep on changing from age to age. Endowed with the strength of past experiences, human beings seek to create their future wealth: this is an undeniable truth. With their eye on the future, those who try to create something by cutting off the past, will utterly fail, for the creation of literature or art can only justify its existence by maintaining its relation between the past and the future. That art or literature which suddenly appears also vanishes equally abruptly, leaving everything in turmoil. Due to changes in the wake of its sudden appearance and disappearance, society has no doubt achieved some gains and sustained some losses, but we cannot accept these changes as the fulfilment of any constructive endeavour.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..46"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=46 type=paragraph -->Litterateurs are the seers of truth, and so naturally we cannot expect anything irrelevant from them. We want to see in their contributions keenness of intellect, wise discrimination, and the sweet touch of a sympathetic heart.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..47"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=47 type=paragraph -->Where the society is caught in the whirlpool of superstitions and prejudices &ndash; where it has lost its vision in the darkness of ignorance &ndash; there litterateurs and artists will have to come forward, even by taking risks. They will have to show the path to others with a flaming torch in hand. It is not proper for them to remain inert and inactive, out of fear of stumbling. It is only through waging a ceaseless struggle against all opposing forces that they will lead humanity forward. For their offense of outspokenness, the vested interests of the different sections of society may threaten them menacingly, but they must remain undaunted by this. As the symbol of the hopes and desires of millions of people, they will have to hold aloft the possibilities of the next era, after transcending the limits of this one. In this undertaking there is as much responsibility as there is hard labour, not a bit less. Taking into account the natural means of expression of human aspirations, the artists will have to portray the ideal in a mode which is easily understandable by the masses.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..48"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=48 type=paragraph -->The Language of the Era<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..49"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=49 type=paragraph -->Litterateurs who are born in a particular age or environment cannot completely transcend the influence of that particular environment, creating a literature based on an altogether different idea language. Human taste is advancing through changes; not only is language and its style of expression changing, but it is gradually losing its simplicity due to more complicated modes of thought. I am not referring here to the litterateurs&#146; unnecessary endeavours to create linguistic intricacies and complexities. Whether they like it or not, due to unavoidable necessity, they are gradually being compelled to use more and more complex language. This state of affairs also existed in the past, exists in the present, and will remain in the future. So taking into account the peculiarities of the underlying ideas and language, the insightful critic can very easily detect the lapses of the litterateur. The language of one era will become archaic or awkward in the next: no epic verse can be composed today with the simplicity of Valmiki&#146;s<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.1.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#1.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> language. The use of denominative verbs as in the era of Michael Madhusudhan Dutt would only provoke laughter in this age. The ideas and language of Bha&#x301;ratacandra&#146;s Vidyasundara received great approbation from the cultured people of that time, and used to be recited with great appreciation in the royal court. The poet, too, was honoured with a royal title in recognition of his work. But today this work is considered obscene in its ideas and language, unfit to be read in the society. Even the word that the litterateurs of today unhesitatingly express will perhaps one day become considered indecent in civilized society. But litterateurs are absolutely helpless in this regard, for it is impossible for them to completely shake off the thought and language of their era. In spite of the expansion of their vision over all the eras, their physical existence indeed remains embedded in a particular age. How is it possible for them to cut themselves off from the influence of their era, whose light and air, soil and water, fruits and flowers, have saturated their whole lives? Can&#x301;d&#x301;ida&#x301;sa in his Shriikrs&#x301;n&#x301;a-Kiirtana portrayed Ra&#x301;dha&#x301; far more crudely than Jna&#x301;nada&#x301;sa and Govindada&#x301;sa did in their literary creations, and yet in simplicity and sincerity Shriikrs&#x301;n&#x301;a-Kiirtana is impeccable, regardless of its valuation in the royal courts of literature.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..50"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=50 type=paragraph -->The Taste of the Age<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..51"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=51 type=paragraph -->An age advances though the physical, psychic, and causal spheres. The hands may not move as fast as the feet, and the intellect may move a thousand times faster than the hands; therefore different eras unfold at the same time in the life of an individual or a society. While evaluating literature, we should remember this fact, otherwise we may do injustice to the litterateurs and artists. It is necessary to have different kinds of yardsticks for measuring different things. Those who are awed by the unique artistic expression of the Kon&#x301;a&#x301;rka Temple sneer in contempt at its obscene sculptures. From the viewpoint of the modern era, they are perhaps correct, for their minds are conditioned by the taste of this era. But we must not forget that those sculptures possessed within them the combined expressions of other eras as well &ndash; that those artistic creations are the eloquent proofs of those very combined expressions.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..52"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=52 type=paragraph -->With the dawn of civilization, humanity&#146;s artistic mind was developed, and people expressed themselves through the media of arts and crafts. Primitive humans depicted in stone the images of the birds or animals they hunted, as well as the images of their own internal conflicts. Small groups of people constantly thought of reinforcing and increasing the strength and number of their respective groups in order to be victorious in their battles, and this in the arts of those days we find the appearance of Phallus worship as the symbol of numerical maximisation. This very Phallus worship, prevalent among primitive people of the non-Aryan society was given a new philosophical interpretation by the refined Aryans, and transformed into Shiva-liun&#x32D;ga. In spite of the subtlety or refinement behind this philosophical substantiation, the more developed people lacked that simplicity of taste which the primitive people possessed. But the expressions of both groups have now become offensive to the taste of the people of today. Of course these are the results of epochal changes.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..53"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=53 type=paragraph -->If two eras are expressed simultaneously through some artists&#146; hands and feet, thought and expression, then they may indeed possess all the faculties of mind &ndash; their contributions may be enriched with all the sweetness of their hearts, but there will certainly be no harmonious balance between their actions and their feelings. The thought-waves of the sculptors of Kon&#x301;a&#x301;rka could not flow at the same speed towards subtlety as did their chisels and hammers.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..54"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=54 type=paragraph -->The Message of Human Fulfillment<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..55"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=55 type=paragraph -->The genius that evolves from age to age through the process of introversion and extroversion of the intellect is indeed bearing the message of the fulfilment of human potentiality. At every step the warm breath of its labour and fatigue finds true expression: no one has the power to withstand this force. Those who want to transform their psychic wealth into inertness and inaction may perhaps obstruct this force of expression for a while, but the inner momentum of its dynamism will not be the least impaired. The very next moment it will break through all the dams of obstacles with a force increased a thousand-fold. That is why I say that it is through the fight against opposing forces that the intellect is awakened.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..56"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=56 type=paragraph -->This very suppressed consciousness has indeed laid the foundation of human civilization &ndash; has infused literary judgement with a refined outlook, and flavoured the taste of life with the nectar of Cosmic Bliss. Indeed, in every era literature has depicted the unique union of bliss (shreya) and objective pleasure (preya) in different modes according to the different phases of evolution to the characteristic self (svabha&#x301;va). That which is antithetic to one&#146;s nature, no matter how assiduously one might attempt to paint it with the colours of the imagination, can never be accepted by humanity as its own. If we liken Coastal Literature to the gala dress and Epochal Literature to everyday wear, then we will have to call this kind of impractical fantasy a dress of silvery tinsel. It has no use in life, nor has it any relation with the inner nature of human beings.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..57"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=57 type=paragraph -->In order to give full expression to this continuous flow of humanity&#146;s true nature, then insight, power of expression, and boldness &ndash; all three are necessary. The creation of ideal literature is not possible for those who are ever ready to yield to the pressures of the throng. To manifest that true nature (svabha&#x301;va), one will have to give a clarion call to the common people to struggle against those forces that want to suck dry their vitality. Those voices which lack that bold heroism will simply whine and whimper doggerels in the name of poetry &ndash; they will try to save themselves from the responsibility of reality by counting the stars in the heavens.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..58"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=58 type=paragraph -->All are moving forward: no one has come to sit idle, and so everyone will have to march ahead in harmony with all, maintaining a fine adjustment with the flow of life. Whether in thought or in action, in all spheres the fundamental characteristic of humanity is to move ahead. Where there is inertness, there is darkness. So one must not give the least indulgence to inertness in the spheres of thought and language. Inertness is just another name for the blind attachment to the past. For the sake of benevolence, for the sake of bliss, this attachment has to be cast aside. If an idea is likened to iron, then the dynamism of language shall be the touchstone. One must always be vigilant so that the iron will not lose contact with the touchstone. So before giving expression to any elevated idea, the litterateurs must seek out this touchstone, they must bring it under their control. Many people have ideas which do not blossom forth due to lack of mastery over language. Those who have ideas must develop their power of expression through continued practice and effort: and those who possess the power of expression must make efforts to awaken their latent insight. The litterateur must possess both expression and insight: where there is no iron, the touchstone is meaningless.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..59"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=59 type=paragraph -->By power of expression, I do not mean merely an individual&#146;s skill with language; rather I mean the irresistible force of the mind and heart. Where there is a lack of boldness and courage, there the language is prone to move with diffident steps, with hesitant deliberation. Such a timid language cannot express independent thinking due to the impact of the prevalent social superstitions and prejudices, the static bondages of the existing religions, the pressures of political ideologies of communalism and provincialism, and the false pride of nationalism and narrow-minded political ideas. Thwarted by this impact, the weak language either stops moving or expresses itself with extreme diffidence, while following the policy of &ldquo;kill the snake but save the stick.&rdquo; The root cause of this weakness lies in the cowardice of individual life and the blind attachment to the past. Litterateurs have to assert themselves thunderingly, giving a stirring call to the people and, setting aside all the garbage of impurities with a bold mind and with strong arms, clear the path of human emancipation. In the path of fulfillment, they must be the pioneers.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..60"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=60 type=paragraph -->Here there may be a slight confusion with regard to the dynamism of language. What I mean exactly is that the language, too, moves forward, keeping pace with the speed of thought. At times the language of those whose thoughts cannot freely move forward under the weight of ignorance or prevalent superstitions, is also very forceful and dynamic. Even the language of those who compose doggerels glorifying the greatness of a family, caste or pilgrimage, at times appears to be attractive and impressive. One can also write a thesis in powerful language on petty matters like &ldquo;A Sneeze,&rdquo; &ldquo;A House Lizard,&rdquo; or, before preparing for a journey, on &ldquo;Best To Go North, Not East&rdquo;; but such language I refuse to accept as truly dynamic language, for it bustles about within the iron railings of superstitions and attachments to the past. It has speed but no movement. A deep analysis will show that with all its acrobatics it has not moved even a step forward. Yoked to the millstone of superstition, like the bullock of an oil-mill, it has perhaps strutted proudly the whole day for fifty miles with brisk strides, but it could not move a step forward.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="1..62"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=62 type=paragraph -->The whole existence of human beings is ever-anxious for mental development. Whatever is conducive to that development people cordially welcome, calling their distant friends nearer to them in the effort to express themselves; and whatever is antagonistic to this development they reject with all their hearts, though they may be forced to temporarily submit to it under circumstantial pressure. But as soon as an opportunity presents itself, they rise in revolt to deliver themselves from its clutches. This is human nature at all times and in all ages. Thus whenever something has to be done for humanity, it must be done keeping this essential human characteristic in mind. The author&#146;s literature and the artist&#146;s creation of art are indeed dedicated to the service of humanity, and so the litterateur and the artist must always deeply remember this truth. They will have to delineate their subject or theme in such a way that people, while assimilating it, may not feel any impediment in the path of their development. Interest must be created through natural expression. The suggestion of subtle hints, interest and humour that exists even in the crudeness of ordinary life has to be adroitly held up before the eyes of the people &ndash; a touch of its colour must be conveyed to their minds.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..63"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=63 type=paragraph -->It is easy to talk, but difficult to act; for in spite of mental characteristics being the same in all persons, they are expressed differently at different times, at different places, and in different persons due to variations of reactive momenta (sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ra) or environmental peculiarities. If the artist&#146;s mind can be made to touch the innermost hearts of others &ndash; if their human sentiment can be synchronised with others&#146; sentiments &ndash; then alone can people determine which path will be truly beneficial for them, which road will lead to the greatest unfoldment of their potentialities. If the potentialities of individual or collective development are not clearly understood, the psychic wealth of humanity may be misused at any moment.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..64"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=64 type=paragraph -->Literature can beautifully convey to those who have the potentiality of leadership, how to develop that leadership properly, and how to establish that benevolent leadership on a firm foundation. But leadership is not only found among the good. Thieves, dacoits and knaves also have their leaders; and there are also leaders in reactionary movements. So if those with the potential of leadership, who are anxious to express their leadership qualities, derive suggestions from the litterateur how to enhance their personal prestige through malevolence and wickedness instead of through true benevolence and welfare, they may perhaps readily choose the evil path. People are desperate to develop themselves: if they are not guided onto the path of welfare by the litterateurs, they will follow the path of evil. They have no time to count the waves, sitting on the shore of the sea of time. They do not, and they will not, sit quietly, subduing their desires and propensities in the hope that some day, someone will come and direct them onto the path of benevolence.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..65"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=65 type=paragraph -->Human beings want free and untrammelled expression of their innermost thoughts and feelings. Few people have the capacity to judge the way this expression is taking place. Some ability, no doubt, develops at a later age as the result of many trials and tribulations, but it is completely absent in childhood, in adolescence and in early youth. So during this period, people readily accept glittery, superficial art and literature as an outlet for their self-expression. Instead of seriously pondering over this, they do not even understand the necessity of deeper reflection or analysis.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..66"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=66 type=paragraph -->In this connection it is necessary to add that if two different paths, both good and bad, are presented before people for the expression of the same idea, they will gladly choose the easier one, instead of the more complex one. So no matter how benevolent the ideas of the litterateur, if they are not presented with exuberant delight and overflowing joy, though they may be acceptable to some, they will remain ever disagreeable and indigestible to the general mass. These observations may be somewhat significant for Coastal Literature, but for Epochal Literature they are indeed of paramount importance. If literature is not presented through the medium of joy, then it cannot really be accepted as literature at all, because in spite of its being guided by the thought of benevolence, that thought is unable to take practical shape. Such literature only enhances the price of the book, but it cannot at all enhance the value of humanity. When a presentation is made through the medium of joy, there people have the opportunity for comprehensive enjoyment, and the sympathy of the writer makes direct contact with the hearts of his or her readers. Such an excellent presentation is not possible if the writer lacks genuine human feeling. Good or bad, friend or foe, a chaste lady or promiscuous woman &ndash; all are human to the author. The author will have to be responsive to the aspirations of their hearts, and must try to give proper expression to their inner thoughts and sentiments. He or she will try to delineate their happiness and sorrow, hopes and desires, and treat every small or big clash and counter-clash of their affliction-ridden lives as the expression of the human heart. To the litterateurs no profession or propensity is either dignified or lowly: they will only present all these before the people in their true perspective so that the audience, after being acquainted with them, may make their individual and collective lives more meaningful. In no circumstances must the artist or the litterateur portray humanity as an object of hatred or ridicule. Even the character of a promiscuous woman or a thief must leave on the minds of the readers an impression of sympathy, charged with profound pain.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..67"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=67 type=paragraph -->When artists lack such bold large-heartedness, they view humanity and the world through the spectacles of superstitions &ndash; they are incapable of truly acquainting human beings with each other or with the world, because these spectacles of superstitions or prejudices distort their vision so much that they are unable to understand the true perspective of anything.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..68"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=68 type=paragraph -->Weak-minded litterateurs often try to stirringly exhort their readers with forceful language in order to camouflage their own inherent weaknesses before the public. They think that by the strength of their language they will prevail, but this is a grave error on their part. Perhaps a few fools may be deluded for some time, but ultimately, recognizing the malevolent repercussions of such literature, people will scrupulously avoid it. A careful examination will enable anyone to discover the flagrant emptiness that always lurks behind such high-sounding utterances, Generally speaking, the greater the clouding of the litterateurs&#146; vision by the blind delusions of communalism, provincialism or nationalism, the greater the outpouring of this sort of literature from their pens.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="1..70"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=70 type=paragraph -->There is a serious difference of opinion also among artists and litterateurs with regard to decency and obscenity in art. The conservative among them or the connoisseurs of art and literature are somewhat like the supporters of the cult of Varn&#x301;a&#x301;shrama (the Hindu caste system). They think that a little deviation from the established tradition will tarnish the purity of art or literature. Excessively worried about matters of caste and outcaste, about the analysis of decency and vulgarity in art or literature, they lose sight of its main objective. If writing and drawing, chisel and hammer get themselves entangled in he wranglings of so-called ethics and morality, they cannot make any contribution to any section of the people. If you open a book to find that it contains only the tall topics of morality, you will have a headache before you read even five pages of it. In a movie if only moral ideals are paraded over and over again to the exclusion of everything else, the public will never appreciate that film. The conclusion of all of this is that the thought of public welfare alone should be the main criterion of all artistic and literary creation, and that thought will take form only though artistic joy &ndash; only then can subtle intellect awaken in crude minds. So when the artists or litterateurs have to march forward creating such a flow of delight, they cannot afford to cling to any fastidious notions of so-called purity or impurity, for it will retard progress. Excessive prudery, like mysophobia (fear of contamination), will obstruct their path of movement.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..71"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=71 type=paragraph -->These mysophobic, conservative writers will compose poems about seas, mountains and moonlight &ndash; will paint literary pictures of the drawing-rooms of the aristocratic Ballygunge elite &ndash; but it will offend their pens to write about the endless humiliations, the low standard of living and the vulgar dirtiness of the neglected, uneducated society of the villages, because these matters are unpleasant. The abominable life of corrupt women, the obnoxious environment of the slums, the carnal cravings of antisocial human beasts &ndash; all these they seek to avoid, because they are unacceptable by the standards of &ldquo;decency&rdquo; and &ldquo;decorum&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..72"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=72 type=paragraph -->The human mind has many ideas and propensities that are normal and natural. But the mysophobic artists or litterateurs, with their touch-me-not-or-I-might-lose-my-purity mentality, want to avoid all these.

<a name="1..73"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=73 type=paragraph -->Yet those who are leftists in the world of art are even more dangerous. The defect of the rightists is their inaction, and that of the leftists is their hyper-activity, based on selfishness.

It must be remembered that flies do not heal sores &ndash; rather they exacerbate them, because the very pus of these sores provides them with their vital juice.

Those who are inferior and neglected, who are helpless and destitute &ndash; whom the society considers infernal maggots &ndash; they are the very people who are the most unrepresented in the salons of literature. They are mute; and so the heavy responsibility of expressing the sentiments that are hidden in their tormented minds has to be borne by the artist alone. The litterateur or the artist, has to take the responsibility of enabling them to rise up and sit in the same row with the rest of society, after dusting off the dirt from their bodies.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="1..78"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=78 type=paragraph -->Many people complain that a major part of modern literature is full only of the whimperings of cheap erotic love. I cannot but agree with their complaint. Such allegations can be brought not only in the sphere of literature but in every sphere of art. After seeing Bombay-made films it seems as though juvenile society has, indeed, no other job than busying itself with so-called love &ndash; as though every college girl of any respectable community is engaged in amorous escapades, throwing all decency and decorum overboard. In fact, the mentality of those artists and litterateurs who depict only this type of situation is nothing but impotent.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..79"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=79 type=paragraph -->Whatever be the profound, philosophical implications of the word prema, or love, the true characteristic of prema is supra-physical &ndash; beyond the bondage of any limitation. When artists, absorbed in the essence of love, try to convey it to the people through their language, rhetoric and subtle suggestions, the sweetness of their artistic genius reaches the apex of expression. But then this creation of the artist cannot be regarded as popular literature or art, because the subtle sense which is capable of comprehending that transcendental feeling is, indeed, undeveloped in most people. We do find at places in the literature of Rabindranath Tagore some semblances of this pure, supra-physical love, but whenever Rabindranath tried to give expression to it, he became unintelligible to the mass. The transcendental thoughts and ideas of the sweet, graceful shlokas of the Upanis&#x301;ads are also incomprehensible to the common people.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..80"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=80 type=paragraph -->This sublime prema or love has established itself for all eternity beyond the limits of time, space and person. Infinite love is the ultimate ecstatic expression of finite love. This very sense that artists try to awaken in the popular mind &ndash; when they devote themselves to the task of establishing the link between the finite and the infinite, between the mundane and the transcendental &ndash; this very awareness though not purely transcendental, verily bears the highest importance in the realm of art. Through expressions which are comprehensible to ordinary intelligence, it gradually leads the sweetness of the human mind to a supra-sensible dreamland. Rabindranath&#146;s poem &ldquo;Urvashii&rdquo; is a composition of this type. There is no dearth of physicality in the poem, nor is it difficult to understand; and yet its crude materiality gradually expands into a subtlety beyond understanding.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..81"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=81 type=paragraph -->Love that is completely physical is not love at all in terms of philosophy. Therefore philosophy will not, and perhaps should not, entertain such love at all. But can an artist ignore it? It is in every great or small incident of life that an ordinary person feels pleasure or pain. Even love concerned with the body is not something completely cut off from pleasure and pain. How then can the artist, given to delineating human happiness and sorrow &ndash; sworn to giving form to the impact of human grief and pain, hopes and desires &ndash; neglect this physical love? Regarding this, no artist or litterateur can dispute the statement of Rabindranath:<!-- /block --></p>

But it is a matter of great regret that a class of modern artists, in the realms of poetry, novels, cinema, drama, etc., employ all their artistic talents for the sole purpose of kindling people&#146;s crude sensuality, instead of portraying human propensities with the idealistic outlook of a true artist &ndash; what to speak of portraying their subtle human feelings. Without giving indulgence to conservatism, I would say that this class of artists is truly a blot on society.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="1..89"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=89 type=paragraph -->Some time ago complaints were frequently heard from the lovers of drama that after the great poet Girishchandra, accomplished dramatists are no longer in evidence, and that although other branches of literature have rapidly developed, drama is gradually dying out. Their complaints cannot be easily dismissed; rather they deserve the attention of the drama-loving populace, the dramatists and actors, and the well-wishers of society. Why are good dramas not being produced? Why is there not a good drama in dramatic literature, modelled with the touch of a rare genius like Rabindranath? Perhaps by good drama the complainants mean &ldquo;box-office dramas,&rdquo; and it is precisely because most of Rabindranath&#146;s dramas are lacking in box-office appeal that they do not take them into account.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..90"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=90 type=paragraph -->In literary parlance we may divide drama into two categories: first the box-office play, and secondly, the witty stage play of high literacy excellence, which demands a little extra intellect to understand &ndash; which in English literature is called &ldquo;drama.&rdquo; The first, the box-office plays, are a part of Epochal Literature, and thus it is necessary for the writers of such plays to be well-conversant with the problems of the contemporary era. It is only when it gives just expression to current problems through songs and dance, uproar and tumult, laughter and tears, joys and sorrows, that a play becomes a box-office hit. Even slight or sizeable lapses in characterization and treatment of conflict do not in the least diminish the popular appreciation of this class of drama. Light-hearted audiences of mediocre intelligence go home happy after laughing, crying and enjoying songs and dances for sometime: they do not even feel like criticizing or commenting on the underlying ideas and language of the drama. So the dramatists too have to wield their pens in accordance with the demand of their patrons, the common people. If they have any drawbacks or shortcomings of their own as litterateurs or artists, they can easily disguise them through cheap humour, so that what they have written for the public may justify its existence by offering them a little jollity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..91"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=91 type=paragraph -->The form and presentation of most of the films of modern India, particularly those with the Bombay trade-mark, pertain to this category of drama. There is nothing to ponder or comprehend about these plays; there is hardly any question of reality or unreality in them either. If there is any expression of the age in them, well and good; if not, no harm. But as I have already said, a drama may be considered successful only if it combines excitement with the vivid portrayal of the era. But for this portrayal of the problems of the age in the drama, it is essential for the dramatist to have a clear conception of his or her age. Those who have this are, indeed, genuine dramatists; in such presentation there occurs a wonderful blending of the public demand and the dramatist&#146;s talent.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..92"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=92 type=paragraph -->Most of the compositions of Rabindranath do not fall into this category of plays. He was a real poet and so his dramas, though not neglecting the demand of the age, always sought to remain outside the purview of that era. Thus his dramas were seldom popular in the theatre, where most spectators go for a little amusement and not for appreciating the niceties of literature; but they received the unstinted approbation of the real connoisseurs of art and literature. Those members of the audience who were unable to properly appreciate the subtle nuances of his dramas on the stage, could experience an indescribably wonderful joy as readers of those very dramas. This type of dramatic presentation, which in English is called drama, is called Na&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301;yana in Sam&#x301;skrta. The playwrights draw their vitality from this very Na&#x301;t&#x301;ya&#x301;yana.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..93"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=93 type=paragraph -->It is noteworthy that some of these dramas written somewhat in the style of box-office plays, enjoy greater popularity even than the box-office plays; and from this it is evident that although the common people are fond of riotous hilarities, they have in them a dormant aesthetic sense which may be aroused through song and dance as well as through the medium of the portrayal of pleasure and pain, laughter and mirth. Of course, with the increase in the number of educated people with literary taste, drama, too, is becoming a stage success in many countries. Previously the theatre owners suffered appreciable loss when Shakespeare&#146;s dramas were staged. But now with the increase in the number of literature-lovers. Shakespearean dramas have far surpassed even the box-office plays in popularity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..94"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=94 type=paragraph -->Most of the dramatic compositions of the great poet Girishchandra fall into the category of plays, for he was associated with the professional theatre. He was well aware that dramas, if staged, would not receive any appreciable reception in the society of his time, and thus he took to writing plays. He himself was a reputed actor, and so theatre-goers were great admirers of every character in almost every drama written by him. Yet it must not be forgotten that although he had to write plays for the sake of his professional career, he had within him a deep aesthetic poetic genius, and so most of his plays had the touch of drama - the suggestion of supra-sensibility. In fact, judging Girishchandra&#146;s compositions with an impartial mind, it must be admitted that he chose the middle path between drama and plays. As he expressed in his own language:<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="1..97"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=97 type=paragraph -->I cannot wholly agree with those who say that no good dramas have been produced after the death of Girishchandra; but then I cannot absolutely disagree with them, either. Rather, I would say that after Girishchandra we have had quite a number of good dramatists as well as good actors, but not of the calibre of Girishchandra&#146;s genius: he was a rare combination of a powerful actor and a successful dramatist.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..98"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=98 type=paragraph -->Among the modern critics we notice a sizeable difference of opinion regarding the necessity of song and dance in drama. There is no doubt that background music greatly helps in the creation of dramatic atmosphere. This background music does not fall exactly in the category of songs and lyrics: it is just a subtle device to help the mind apprehend the sentiments portrayed; there is nothing natural or unnatural about it. People go to the theatre knowing that they are going to watch a dramatic performance, and they feel no difficulty in accepting music as a natural part of the drama. But I cannot accept that songs must be in dramas. Let there be an abundance of songs and dances in those plays which are written to elicit cheap applause from the audience, or let there be absolutely unnatural songs forced into the mouths of the hero and the heroine as explanations of each event or situation; but while writing dramas one must be extremely careful in this regard. There are plays in which after a tragic event, such as the death of a dear one, the bereaved mother or wife starts singing a plaintive song, and that, too, to the accompaniment of rhythmic musical instruments. Those who do not analyse this objectivity may perhaps be moved to emotion by such a song of lamentation, but those who are connoisseurs or lovers of literature, will leave the hall in utter disgust; it is not only unreal, it is absolutely offensive to the taste. Even heroes and heroines who did not know each other at all before, are seen singing a duet. Did they rehearse the song beforehand?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..99"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=99 type=paragraph -->Truly speaking, with the exception of musical plays, it is necessary to exercise restraint and good judgement before introducing songs in other dramatic presentations. We can tolerate the character &ldquo;Conscience&rdquo; singing a song in a musical play, for Conscience is an allegorical role. But in the mouths of the hero and heroine any song that is incidental to the story is absolutely unbecoming and out of place. No matter how richly imbued the song is with thought and sentiment, it is not at all desirable to use it as an indication of the future of the dramatic plot. People do sing and dance in the course of their daily lives; such songs and dances do depict their joys and sorrows, hopes and despair, but they sing and dance in particular circumstances. The plaintive song is sung long after the mournful event: with the dead body on their laps, they do not sing sorrowful tunes over it. Upon the receipt of any happy news, people shout or jump for joy, but they do not start dancing according to accepted rules, with proper posture, gesture and rhythm. Song and dance may be introduced in a drama to portray people&#146;s daily lives, but one must be cautious lest they become unnatural to the discriminating readers and spectators.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..100"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=100 type=paragraph -->A drama is concerned with the subtler portion of the mind, and so the songs of dramas have to be imbued with high thought and sentiment. Just to maintain the purity of classical music, a drama cannot give indulgence to substandard compositions. The songs in a play are composed in order to attract the popular mind, and hence there is nothing to be said against them. But one must be careful that the songs contain no seeds of malevolence in them.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="1..102"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=102 type=paragraph -->Today people are extremely pressed for time: they do not have much leisure at their disposal for reading or witnessing dramas. The indomitable urge to triumph over time has gradually obsessed the human mind. Hence playwrights and directors, too, are obliged to adjust themselves to the public demand, adopting the policy of compromise. A play does not have the scope which a longer drama has to vividly portray life, or effectively represent the conflicts of characters. Yet more stress is being given today to plays, since for most people the value of time has considerably increased. It is impossible for a play to accommodate the wider range of a long drama. That is why almost all the dramatists who are engaged in such efforts fail. In a short play it is impossible to give expression to a whole life story, and even any fraction of a conflict cannot be fully dealt with and given full justice. One must be satisfied with presenting only a small portion of any situation or theory. It is only by combining several playlets together that the dramatist can properly portray any situation, problem or ideology: several one-act plays joined together can then mirror the multifarious life of society.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..103"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=103 type=paragraph -->The success of a drama, particularly a mystery drama, depends largely on the creation of suspense. If the theme is not very complicated, the readers or spectators do not feel any particular difficulty, even if the suspense is introduced in the very beginning; in that case the process of appreciation remains undisturbed. But if there are complications in the plot, it is desirable to let the reader or the audience first form a rough guess about the plot and then introduce suspense, instead of introducing it at the very beginning, for this will help them to appreciate the suspense more. Otherwise, if the audience has not even understood the suspenseful plot, the desire for release from the suspense cannot be intensified; rather people spend their psychic energy more on pondering over what they do not understand in the complicate plot, instead of being curious about what is coming next.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..104"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=104 type=paragraph -->In my opinion this applies equally to both screen and stage plays and dramas. The difference between the two is that the assistance that the author of a screen drama derives from the art director or the studio-technicians, the author of a stage drama does not. The latter has to arrange the environment through the media of the dialogues of the different characters.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="1..106"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=106 type=paragraph -->The range and extent of short stories are exactly the same as those of plays: but here the writer must know the technique of presenting a long story concisely. Suspense, too, is equally effective in short stories as in plays: dramatic quality is essential for a writer of those short stories which come in the category of sketches, for a sketch holds an intermediate position between a story and a drama. Some critics think that sketches also come within the category of dramas, and I do not see any reason to contradict their opinion. Actually the most significant difference between a drama and a story is that the characters of a drama act and talk before the readers or the audience in living form, whereas in a story or a novel it is the writer who talks &ndash; either personally or through his or her mentally created characters. The chief characteristic of a drama &ndash; be it an opera, ballet, drama, play, shadow play, etc. &ndash; is that it includes the self-expression of living characters.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..107"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=107 type=paragraph -->Whenever literature properly utilizes the opportunities for relating any actual incident or imaginary event cohesively and adroitly, such a creation is called a long story. In Sam&#x301;skrta a long story is called Katha&#x301;, and a short story is termed Katha&#x301;nika&#x301;. The responsibility of the novelist, however, is a great deal more onerous than that of a story writer, for in novels the systematic narration of a story is not the sole or primary element: along with it, psychological analysis as well as the conflicts of characters must also find proper expression. To compose Coastal Literature around stories is extremely difficult, if not impossible; but in novels it is quite possible. Novels are a form of fiction, or upanya&#x301;sa. (It is difficult to find exact equivalents in Sam&#x301;skrta for these two words, &ldquo;novel&rdquo; and &ldquo;upanya&#x301;sa.&rdquo; The word upanya&#x301;sa, current in languages like Bengali, Hindi, etc., means &ldquo;to place together, to juxtapose.&rdquo; There is some confusion in the meaning of the word in Bengali and Hindi. In some Indian languages the word ka&#x301;dambarii is used for upanya&#x301;sa; this is probably due to its being related to the Sam&#x301;skrta book entitled &ldquo;Ka&#x301;dambarii.&rdquo; The novel form of literature never existed in ancient Indian literature, and thus there is no Sam&#x301;skrta term for this word.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..108"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=108 type=paragraph -->Generally it is noticed that human thinking capacity becomes somewhat dull in the wake of a major catastrophe. This accounts for the present psychic state of the human race, following two major wars which took place within a short period of time, with various miseries and tribulations as a result. Humanity is presently unable to think, read or comprehend anything serious. Even artists and litterateurs who are capable of thinking or expressing serious matters do not feel any urge to do so, thinking that in this way they will not get any encouragement or patronage from the public. To say that there are no artists today is an absolute falsehood: there are still some, though they are lacking in vitality. What is scarce is not artists but patronage and encouragement. Even if we accept that the real artist does not create art in the hope of receiving encouragement from anyone, I would say that when artists, propelled by their heart&#146;s emotion, or engaged in the endeavour to lose themselves in the expression of their art, undertake to create something, even at that time it is necessary to supply them with the necessary provision for the expression of their vital force. The lack of such provision means that both the artists and their art meet their premature doom. So instead of blaming the artists, condemning their worthlessness with rude language, one has to admit this paramount truth &ndash; that since we ourselves are incapable of thinking or understanding anything serious, we are actually pushing the truly creative, quality artists towards destruction.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="1..110"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=110 type=paragraph -->The essence of poetry or poetic literature is its penetrating appeal: here the emotion of the heart is predominant. That which is narrated in prose, in simple, direct language is expressed in poetry tinged with the colour of the core of the heart, and with subtle suggestions of the unknown. The readers are required to understand the dynamic relation between the past and the future through the feelings of their hearts.

<a name="1..111"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=111 type=paragraph -->These days humanity has lost its aesthetic appreciation for poetry as a result of the torments from the harsh blows of reality. Poetic literature, particular the epic, has become completely obsolete. And yet when humanity first attempted to determine the relation between the natural and the supernatural, when the subtle aesthetic sense was awakened in them for the first time, then the basket of literature was filled with the cowrie-shells of poetry. But today these cowries are obsolete: they have no value in the market; and poetic literature, too, is in the process of decay. Few people buy poetry books to read. Yet during the spring of youth, when the ebullience of the heart is pronounced, adolescents still read poems and try to explain them to others, or recite them with all the sweetness of their hearts. But with advancing age, when the once sensitive mind, smitten by the blows and counter-blows of the world, becomes hardened like as over-burnt brick, charred in the fire of worldly ordeals, then its capacity to appreciate poetry is reduced to nothing. People come to like only those things that have some relation with reality, and the ebullience of the emotion of the heart no longer has any appreciable value. Of course there are exceptions, but generally we find that the poems that elderly people recite are invariably those that they had memorized during their early youth. The poets, in order to survive this situation, are now tending towards composing realistic poems. This is not altogether bad, for at least in this way poetic literature may find the path to longevity.<!-- /block --></p>

People want light and attractive essays today; thus to satisfy this demand novelists and essayists have started composing charming compositions in which seriousness has no scope. In lucid language the essayists tell their stories with some flashes or erudition here and there, dwelling on small or great themes, from the lowest to the highest. The writers of such narratives or descriptions have no recognized standard before them, nor is there any constructive endeavour on their part to create one, either. The writers seem to give more importance to linguistic jugglery, thereby relegating their main theme to a secondary position.

<a name="1..137"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=137 type=paragraph -->Towards the Transcendental Entity<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..138"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=138 type=paragraph -->As the sense of subtle aesthetics was developed in human beings in the course of evolution, a desire for the creation of art was also awakened in them. The ideal of the artist is be to established in transcendentality beyond the bounds of the sensory world. So the artists, or more precisely, the worshippers of fine art, have to be spiritual aspirants if they want to move on the right path. The cultivation of fine arts is but a mockery on the path of those who have not developed spiritual sentiment or accepted the spiritual ideal as the goal of life. Only those who look upon everything of the world in a spiritual spirit can realize in everything the blissful, transcendental Entity. The greater the realization of this transcendental Entity, the greater the understanding of one&#146;s oneness with Him, and thus the greater the success in the creation of art. The successful creation of art is absolutely impossible by those who, in spite of their possessing some creative faculty, do not seek that subtle Entity. Such people&#146;s thought processes go adrift, like a sailboat with a torn sail. Their mental aberration is reflected through all of their writings, which ultimately become strange and grotesque.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..139"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=139 type=paragraph -->Besides this, in the individual lives of such artists, there occurs a serious catastrophe. In the battle between their transitory sense of aesthetics and their lust for material happiness, their strength of character is torn in this tension between the subtle and the crude. That is why we find that in the history of the world those who lacked purity or spiritual ideals and spiritual austerity &ndash; no matter how great their genius as poets, litterateurs and artists, no matter what reputation they had earned in their respective fields of art &ndash; could not command respect and prestige as human beings in society due to their loose characters. It is due to this lack of firmness of character that the talents of many good singers, actors, and other kinds of artists have prematurely withered away, before attaining full development.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..140"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=140 type=paragraph -->As mentioned above, the greater the touch with transcendentality, the greater the success of the artist, for knowingly or unknowingly the human mind is seeking transcendentality. People yearn for the unknown: they cannot remain content with the known; thus where there is an endeavour to create art merely out of the events of daily life, it does not appeal to the intuitional faculty of the human mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..141"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=141 type=paragraph -->Can there be an artist without genius? Is art the result only of sincere endeavour, of hard labour? Quite a knotty question! I think the answer lies in the inherent spiritual thirst of human beings. In other words, a genius is born into this world with a powerful innate spiritual hunger, whether he or she realizes it or not. For those who do not have this spiritual hunger, the effort to become artists by toilsome labour alone is absolutely useless. But then, if a person who has no creative genius succeeds in kindling his or her spiritual urge and desire for the infinite, then it will not be impossible for him or her to develop genius.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..142"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=142 type=paragraph -->Naturalness and Unnaturalness in Art<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..143"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=143 type=paragraph -->Another consideration which is often discussed in the question of naturalness in art. According to many, art should faithfully express itself in the same natural way that, for example, people normally eat, sleep and talk: otherwise, it is said, that art will be defective. In the field of dramatic art, greater emphasis is given to this idea of naturalness these days. This has also affected recitation and other artistic modes, but I cannot fully agree with this idea. Depending upon the theme and nature of the topic, the introduction of diversity in theatrical expression is quite natural. To express crude ideas one must resort to crude language, crude gestures, and crude ways of expression in daily life. These, however, cannot be employed to give expression to subtle feelings. For this a particular language, a particular diction and a particular gesture will be necessary, and in such cases it will be easy to appreciate the beauty of dramatic performance as such &ndash; that is, on its face value, instead of looking at it as an expression of naturalness.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..144"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=144 type=paragraph -->Actually, the vivid presentation of the artist&#146;s ideas is of primary importance, and to achieve this any means necessary should be adopted. We should not be over concerned with the naturalness or unnaturalness: none of the illustrious actors of the world ever worried over this point, nor do they do so even today. This dogmatic declaration about the importance of naturalness in art has not issued from the important personages of the theatrical world, but from petty people with superficial knowledge. The combination of language and gesture (mudra&#x301;) that makes dramatic acting successful must be fully utilized by the actors. To maintain naturalness one must not render the language confused or incoherent, or the characters gestureless and awkward. In individual life, in our so-called &ldquo;natural&rdquo; state we seek to express our inner ideas, and often the communication of these ideas to others is secondary. In dramatic performance, however, this communication is of primary importance.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..145"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=145 type=paragraph -->Music<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..146"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=146 type=paragraph -->The same holds true for music. The totality of song, instrumental play and dance (giita-va&#x301;dya&#x301;-nrtya) is called sam&#x301;giita or music. When a song is composed only to express the laughter and tears of ordinary life, there is hardly any difficulty in conveying this to the ears and hearts of the people: the song discharges its responsibility well enough through the medium of ordinary language and melody. But where the feelings and sensibilities are deep and subtle &ndash; where one has to create vibrations in the molecules and atoms of the body, in the chords of the heart &ndash; there the music has to follow an extraordinary path: Hence to those who are incapable of ingesting the subtle feelings of the Science of Music, the a&#x301;la&#x301;pa or introductory portion of a classical piece, will be nothing but pra&#x301;la&#x301;pa or delirious raving.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..147"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=147 type=paragraph -->If music must descend to the ordinary level of life to conform to the slogan of naturalness, then preeminence will be given to doggerels, as the sweetness and charm of real music becomes extinct. Indeed, the music that is in vogue in the world today in the name of &ldquo;popular music&rdquo; is nothing but doggerels of this type, though expressed in a better language. Language, rhythm and melody are the indispensable parts of a song: one cannot exclude any one of them. (The difference between song and instrumental music is that songs comprise rhythm, melody and language, but in instrumental music, rhythm is predominant, melody is subordinate, and language is absolutely nil.)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..148"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=148 type=paragraph -->Dance and Recitation<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..149"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=149 type=paragraph -->Dance is customarily divided into two categories: gestural and rhythmic. Many people are loathe to accept that gestureless rhythmic dance can be considered dance at all. Judging the characteristics of dance, it must be admitted that both gestures and rhythm are important components in dance: the gestures give expression to inner sentiment, and the rhythm gives it dynamism. If dance is only gestural and devoid of rhythm, it is called pantomime, not dance. And dance, devoid of gestures is nothing but another form of physical exercise &ndash; it is not art.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..150"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=150 type=paragraph -->The greatest difference between recitation and acting is that in acting there is both language and gesture; while recitation (a&#x301;vrtti) consists of only language. Thus in acting there is greater scope for the expression of refined aesthetic taste than in recitation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..151"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=151 type=paragraph -->Architecture and Painting<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..152"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=152 type=paragraph -->As for architecture, a perfect mastery of the science of engineering along with the knowledge of art is necessary, and thus there is a wonderful blending of the crude and subtle arts in architecture. No matter how great is the suggestion of subtle aesthetic sense in architecture, it never has scope for being unnatural. Yet it is in painting and sculpture, which are considered the subtlest of all arts, that we find the true expression of the wonderful aesthetic sense of the human mind. In the calm stillness of a painting or a sculpture, all has to be vividly expressed &ndash; laughter and tears, hopes and fears, gestures and language. Indeed, it is the arts of painting and sculpture that beautifully bridge the gap between the mundane and the supramundane.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..153"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=153 type=paragraph -->As in dramatic acting, so in painting and sculpture the question of naturalness or unnaturalness arises, and here too the same answer holds true: the mode of expression must be chosen to suit the sentiment being expressed. In fact to raise the question of naturalness or unnaturalness in painting is absolutely unfitting. The artist at the time of giving physical expression to his or her mental image is not bound to reproduce a particular part of the body according to physiological science. Giving form to thought or idea is what is important: the artist is not a teacher of physiology. Bringing thought or idea into the world of form is his or her artistic sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..154"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=154 type=paragraph -->Society&#146;s Responsibility towards the Artists<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..155"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=155 type=paragraph -->The artists and the litterateurs are the guides of the society, and to keep a watchful eye on their ease and comfort, to help them preserve their existence, is the sacred duty of the society. And this sense of duty is all the more necessary where art and literature is practiced as an indispensable part of social service, not as a profession. People can on no account evade their responsibilities toward the artist, since art and literature are dedicated solely to service of the people. Where the state belongs to the people or is run according to their will &ndash; that is to say, in a democratic state &ndash; the government as the representative of the people, should take over this sacred responsibility. When the government has to face various difficulties due to financial stringency or where the state due to some particular policy or any other cause is reluctant to give any encouragement to art, then the people outside the government in the private sector will have to shoulder this responsibility directly. Taking into consideration the financial conditions of those who are cultivating the different fields of art today, we find that those who are practicing music are the most solvent. With cinema, radio and recording, musicians on the whole have ample opportunity to earn money by displaying their skill in social gatherings and variety entertainments.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..156"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=156 type=paragraph -->Except for a few prominent individuals the condition of the majority of dancers and instrumentalists is not at all good; it is even worse than that of the singers. Nevertheless dance and instrumental music are far subtler than the art of vocal music.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..157"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=157 type=paragraph -->Reciters, too, have almost no scope to earn money. So many talented reciters usually stop their artistic endeavour due to the lack of sufficient encouragement by society.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..158"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=158 type=paragraph -->Many people may perhaps think that these days actors and actresses are riding the crest of popularity. This may be true of a handful of people, but not of the collectivity. Only those who have earned their reputation in the cinema or on the professional stage have a good income, and indeed they do very well; but for those actors of mediocre talent, the scope of earning money is quite limited. No one is willing to give new actors and actresses a chance. Even if they are given the opportunity to perform, the amount of wages offered them is not even adequate for their subsistence. Most directors do not want to take risks with new and young actors and actresses. Art producers and distributors find it more convenient to increase the sales of their films with old and seasoned stars. Most of the producers that have experience in the film business are not knowledgeable about the technique and standard of the art of the film, and so they too do not come forward to help the new artists. Therefore, on the whole, in all countries of the world the only hope of new-comers with histrionic talents is the professional stage. Non-professional theatres in the countries where they do not receive appreciable state aid, are in a decrepit condition due to their failure to compete with the cinemas. So it has not been possible for them to accommodate the new artists.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..159"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=159 type=paragraph -->If dramatic art is to develop properly &ndash; indeed, if it is to be kept alive at all &ndash; then every country must adopt a strong policy. The first step of this policy must be to build up fully or partially government aided theatres in every major village and city, which must be exempt form amusement taxes. Of course the people should expect that the government will adopt a liberal policy and award full freedom to the non-official connoisseurs of art in the selection of the subject matter of the dramas. If the condition is imposed that none of he political groups be allowed to use dramas as the media of their party propaganda, this will be a welcome measure. When the number of theatres are increased and dramatic performances are popularized, there will be a greater demand for dramas. This will certainly encourage the talented authors to write dramas. It is because dramas do not sell well that powerful authors do not want to write dramas. If dramas receive proper remuneration, then there will certainly be a change in the authors&#146; outlook. Furthermore, if the number of theatres is increased, the playwrights will no longer have to depend upon the generosity of a few big theatre magnates; for if the dramas prove their worth in the theatres, the playwrights will not have to worry about how to sell their dramas.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..160"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=160 type=paragraph -->One more step, in my opinion, that may be taken in order to encourage the dramatists, is to give them financial help in the form of a daily honorarium for the number of days their dramas run on the stage, regardless of whether they are professional or non-professional. This will give the dramatists the opportunity to earn some money whenever their dramas are staged and thereby keep them free from the cares of subsistence. Then they will be able to apply their minds to writing more and more new dramas for human society.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..161"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=161 type=paragraph -->Gone are the days of poems and poetry as a commercial proposition. Books of poetry sell even less than dramas, and it is hard to say how far the slogan &ldquo;Read more poetry&rdquo; will help. But I think we should expect good results if the custom of presenting books of poems at various social ceremonies and festivals is introduced. The poets may even get sufficient encouragement if different books of poetry are selected as textbooks for higher classes, that is, each book by a single poet. If the compositions of the different poets are compiled in one single book, none of the poets will reap any financial benefit.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..162"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=162 type=paragraph -->Encouraging Painting and Sculpture<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..163"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=163 type=paragraph -->Painting and sculpture, the two subtlest of the arts, are the most deprived of popular encouragement and sympathy. It may be argued that the sculptors of those countries where idolatry is prevalent have been able to preserve their art due to popular support, and the problem of their subsistence is thus beings solved without any government aid. Is this not, some say, the most significant sign of popular support? I cannot persuade myself, however, that the people of idolatrous countries are connoisseurs and patrons of sculptural art. There is no doubt that the people of these idolatrous countries buy images from the image-makers, but they do this under the inspiration of their religion and not our of love for art. If love of art were their motivation, then they would certainly not throw those symbols of art into the water after worship. The situation is different where people buy images of metal, wood or stone to permanently establish a deity in their homes: but there, too, the buyer&#146;s intention is not to encourage art. Although they pay some attention to the beauty and sweetness of the image, they do not give a free hand to the sculptor in its creation, for the artists always have to work confined within the boundaries of the religious eulogies to particular gods: they seldom have any opportunity to display their own conceptual originality. Hence the observation that the people of idolatrous countries patronise art by buying images is not correct: they only help to preserve a particular class of artists.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..164"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=164 type=paragraph -->In order to encourage the art of image-making, the artists should be given full freedom, or else their creations will be mere made-to-order, commonplace things. The artists should freely mould images of human beings, animals, natural objects, and all natural and unnatural events. Producing newer and newer thoughts and ideas daily, they will go on moulding newer and newer gods, and the hymns of the gods will evolve centring around the images of their art. Then alone will art find its justification. The creations of the artist will not remain confined within the four walls of the temples, but will rather be in close touch with the common people in all spheres of social life. Statues, deities and other creations will attain a place in every field of social life &ndash; in homes, drawing rooms, clubs, schools, parks, and indeed, everywhere. Sculptural art must be made popular by occasionally holding exhibitions as well.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..165"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=165 type=paragraph -->Regardless of whether the image-makers receive patronage or not for their idols, there is still a class of people who are getting the opportunity of practising the art of painting. At one time a number of small groups of painters emerged in different countries. In Bengal for instance, there was a class of people who took to painting as their community trade: they were known as patuas, or painters. Of course, while painting gods and goddesses, they had to work according to the specifications embodied in the sacred hymns, and thus they had very little scope for original expression. Nevertheless, apart from these divine images, they used to paint many other things as well, taking full advantage of their freedom and opportunities. The people of the society used to patronise these patuas in the same way as they did other artisans and professionals. Together with their purchases from the market, they would also buy one or two pictures painted by these village artists. But those days are gone now. Today the paintings of these artists have lost their prestige due to various psychological and economic causes. With the development of the sophisticated techniques of printing it has become far too easy for people to collect different types of cheap and showy pictures. This has afforded opportunities to a few reputed artists to earn money and they, in turn, have no doubt provided opportunities to some other traders to earn money as well; but in the process they have uprooted the patua community from society.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..166"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=166 type=paragraph -->The lack of proper appreciation is one of the causes of the destruction of this art, if not the chief cause. The people of India have not at all appreciated the pictures painted by the village artists, considering them to be most ordinary or even unnatural; instead they buy, at higher prices, pictures of the same kind or of inferior quality, which are painted by reputed artists of distant lands. Previously people looked down on the paintings of Jamini Roy as the pictures of Kalighat, but when a famous gentleman from a faroff country showered unstinted praise upon these very Kalighat-brand pictures, then the local people deigned to take a little interest in him. Long ago, Jamini Roy should have received the recognition which he has today. Truly speaking, most people have constantly ignored the merits and demerits, the speciality and charm of the art of painting, and that is why it is incumbent on the state or the cultural institutions to keep alive this art and its artists. Furthermore, they must awaken in the people an artistic outlook; that is, it is the duty of these very institutions to make people appreciative of art. As artists the names of Nandalal Bose and Aban Thakur are well established today: yet I think the people would have taken a much longer period to recognize them, had the recognition of Rabindranath not preceded them. To buy the original paintings of the artists is often beyond the means of the people and so, in spite of their love of art, they are generally satisfied with inferior substitutes: in other words, they decorate their homes with copies. The artists do not usually benefit financially from this, and indeed very often they suffer losses &ndash; and not only financially. To remedy this, art galleries should be maintained in the major clubs and libraries; the original paintings can be lent to the members in exactly the same way as books are loaned form the libraries. In this way the artists, especially the new ones, will get great encouragement. The clubs and libraries may even print the pictures that become particularly popular.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="1..168"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=168 type=paragraph -->When we consider those litterateurs who are the most numerous and the most vocal among the artists today, we find that their literary practice has generally not been able to solve the problem of their subsistence. In most cases the sugar of their profit is being gobbled up by the ants of publishers. We hear everywhere that there is a slump in the book market, and the royalty rates for new writers is not even discussed in society. If those who are the pioneers of society, who portray the past in the present and the present for future posterity, who offer suggestions of the picture of the future to the people of the present &ndash; if they are forced to starve or half-starve, this will certainly not be to the credit of human society. It is unthinkable that these creative geniuses should curse their own fate. In my opinion the litterateurs themselves will have to find the solution to this problem. They should take up the publication of their books themselves, on a cooperative bases. It is not possible for the insolvent litterateurs to operate this business individually, nor is it desirable; for then they might become dominated by a capitalistic, materialistic mentality. Nor is it desirable to constantly blame the governments without reason; indeed, if the book publishing business falls in the hands of the government, litterateurs may suffer more harm than good. The publishing business must be kept completely in the hands of private organizations, or else literature will cease to be literature and will be transformed into the bulletins of various parties, as has been, and is, the case in many countries of the world.<!-- /block --></p>

Secondly, those who criticize others should also be thoroughly well-versed in art and literature. To pass opinion without having studied or written anything oneself, after merely going through a few books of criticism, is nothing but officious meddling and interference. Such critics who lack adequate knowledge indulge in literary gasconades based on their superficial views, and think that they can get away with it. Yet such a sham and hollow intellect is to no avail, for it will ultimately be exposed. Those sincere and discriminating artists who are truly willing to reform themselves, if they are deluded by such critics, will only become disturbed.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..171"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=171 type=paragraph -->In this connection there is one more important factor: those who could not succeed as authors themselves even after writing dozens of books, are the very people who are extremely vocal in criticizing others. In other words, they betray their own long-standing failures through their criticism. It is futile to expect any help or constructive guidance from this class of so-called critics. In all spheres of life it must be remembered that if one seeks to display one&#146;s authority, one also has to shoulder the responsibility. We have the right to walk on the streets, and so we also bear the responsibility of keeping them in good order by forming a municipality. Those who love art and artists, should criticize them with a sympathetic mind. In such a criticism there may even be caustic censures of serious and sizeable flaws, yet behind these the sympathetic touch of the critic&#146;s heart should be able to be easily understood by any litterateur or artist; then the artist may easily accept the critic as his or her own. Indeed, today we need this type of critic.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..172"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=172 type=paragraph -->These days the Goddess of Learning (Sa&#x301;hitwa Sarasvatii) is mortgaged to the Goddess of Wealth (Laks&#x301;mii), for the value of the Goddess of Learning now depends upon the favour of the Goddess of Wealth. Whatever the quality of writing, if the publisher is well-established, the book will sell well in the market due to effective advertisement techniques. Thus the indigent litterateur undergoes humiliation by cringing at the doors of the reputed publishers; and the publishers are quick to exploit this situation in their favour. Due to publicity stunts and propaganda, it has become impossible for the common people to know which book is good and which is not. There is a flagrant dearth of developed critical literature or critical magazines in every country of the world. Books sell in the market on the strength of publicity alone, or due to their ability to excite the lower human propensities, or due to their gross catering to the crude entertainment of the common mass. That is why we find that the books published by the authors themselves, regardless of how good they are, do not sell well in the market. On the other hand, books which excite people&#146;s sexuality, whatever might be their content or language, sell extremely well. Every reader knows that books like Sasadhar Dutt&#146;s &ldquo;Mohan Series&rdquo; or Dinen Roy&#146;s &ldquo;Rahasya Laharii&rdquo; sold much better than any of the quality books of Bengali literature. Thus sales are no criterion to judge the superiority of any book. It is therefore a great problem for the readers, the purchasers, and the library directors, to select books, and there is no solution to this problem as long as critical literature and critical reviews of high quality are not available.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..173"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=173 type=paragraph -->Caught in the eddies of commercial and party cliques, litterateurs have to face yet another disadvantage. Literary criticism, whether right or wrong, (though in my opinion every criticism (sama&#x301;locana&#x301;) should be healthy criticism (sama&#x301;locana&#x301;)) must always be constructive, and also acquaint the readers with the writer. But where literature is not given proper recognition for any particular reason, where the writer is kept remote from the readers without any introductory review, the situation is very difficult for the writer. It is to avoid this situation that today&#146;s writers have started knocking at the doors of the reputed publishers. This is certainly not a healthy sign for the world of literature.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..174"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=174 type=paragraph -->Taking advantages of their indigence, powerful persons have exploited the litterateurs in various ways and this has taken place from very ancient times. In those days even the kings and emperors&#146; nurtured court poets, giving them gifts of tax free properties, and in exchange they bought their souls. The talented litterateurs or artists frequently had to do uncongenial jobs under circumstantial pressure for the amusement of their patrons. To satisfy the whims of their licentious patrons they had to compose obscene poems and model obscene statues and images. To make their patrons&#146; enemies look contemptible, they had to besmirch their names with scandals and calumnies. To extol the dress, colour, family, caste, class, and ancestry of their patrons they had to resort to lies and fraud, and cite the relevations of the gods in support. The same condition has continued even today. With a very few exceptions, most of the litterateurs belong to the lower stratum of society. In spite of their desire to work independently, most of them have pawned themselves, from the grey matters of their brains to the very tips of their fingers &ndash; to particular people and organizations. Even those who appear from their writings to be bold and spirited, have under circumstantial pressure become the play-things of the political parties.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..175"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=175 type=paragraph -->In contrast with the olden days, the different states of the world have allotted quite a lot of awards for the litterateurs these days. But that is where the danger lies. Any government &ndash; whether monarchical, republican or autocratic &ndash; is run according to a particular ideology, and so there is little chance for the government to suddenly become impartial while bestowing awards on the litterateurs. Naturally it will judge the merits and demerits of the litterateurs through the bias of its own party, and consequently the litterateurs will be compelled to sacrifice their ideals to serve their bellies. These observations are largely applicable to different types of governments, but especially to democratic states, for in democratic states ideological clashes are more in evidence, and hence the necessity of the propagation of ideologies is also more acute. That is why the democratic states want to use the litterateurs as their tools of propaganda. Needless to say, such made-to-order writings cannot be called literature at all: political writings can never be called literature.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..176"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=176 type=paragraph -->If a government sincerely wishes to give encouragement to good and honest litterateurs, then it should form a board of non-political educators to give awards. This task could also be performed by the universities for, on the whole, universities still maintain their non-political nature. Nevertheless, the appointment of a non-political board is preferable, for these days there is an increasing tendency among the universities to flatter the political leaders in the hope of getting an increased government subsidy or grant. By liberally awarding Doctorate degrees to ministers and their deputies, regardless of whether they are deserving or not, the impartiality of the universities is being gradually eroded.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..177"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=177 type=paragraph -->There are some critics who become extremely upset when litterateurs attach themselves to a particular literary group: they say that since literature is for all, why should a litterateur be attached to any particular group? I, however, hold a different view. The ideal of literature is to promote the welfare of all but the process of this endeavour for collective welfare cannot necessarily be the same for all. What is there to grumble about if those litterateurs whose mode of service is similar, chose to move together in a unified group? Those who object to the formation of literary groups and societies under the name of &ldquo;Anti-so-and-so&rdquo; lack tolerance as well as civic sense. Litterateurs may also form &ldquo;Pro-so-and-so&rdquo; groups, and no one should object to it.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..178"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=178 type=paragraph -->Acquiring Proper Knowledge<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..179"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=179 type=paragraph -->The greatest obstacle in the collective progress of the human race is the ignorance of the individual mind. Knowledge is for all &ndash; it should be open and free like the light and air of the sky. It is undeniable that the most powerful medium for the dissemination of knowledge is a good book. That the value of an object is assessed in the field of application is undoubtedly true. And so the greatest means of assessing the value of knowledge is its successful application in the practical field. We cannot accept sterile knowledge as true knowledge &ndash; either it is self-delirium or luxury. Even recognized knowledge loses its value, if after being acquired it is stowed away like packed sacks in the corner of the mind. Of course, if anyone lacks the language to express their feelings or the knowledge that they have acquired through study, then I have no complaint against them. Yet I would say that an artist should try to convey whatever they know to the hearts of the people in an easily understandable manner. Anyone who does not do this is, in my opinion, not properly conscious of his or her social responsibility. Of course, it is quite a different matter if a person suffers some sort of inconvenience or disadvantage in this regard. Those who prove their sense of social duty by placing their feelings properly before people are indeed artists, are truly distinguished litterateurs.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..180"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=180 type=paragraph -->The sole cause of the internal weakness of human society is its ignorance. The superlative intuition (Sambodhi) that removes this ignorance is nothing but the thought of the Cosmic Mind (Bhu&#x301;ma&#x301;ma&#x301;nasa). Art or literature is one of those sources from which common people get the opportunity to become established in the Cosmic Mind. If the mind of one fails to know the minds of others, if the minds of many are not comprehended by the mind of one, then how is the establishment of unity possible? The endeavour (sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;) of the artist or the litterateur has been continuing through the ages, and its aim is to see One among many, and to lead the many to the path of One. In this effort there is no imposition, no injunction of the Law, nor the imperious pressure of any administration, only a sweet and cooperative relation. Though separated by many countries, many states, many religions, many communities and many languages, the human race is an indivisible entity. Every human mind is but the diversified individual manifestation of that same indivisible Cosmic Mind. Today we look forward to the advent of that artist, that litterateur who will convey this truth to the hearts of humanity in a still sweeter language, still more strongly and deeply.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..181"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=181 type=paragraph -->The human race is moving at an irresistible speed. Today, humanity wants to forget those who have written their works centring around various kinds of fissiparous discriminations. Human beings want to channelize their whole range of vision towards the bright future &ndash; a future which will transcend all individual or group interests, all territorial limits of countries and states, and transform the fates of many people into one destiny. Human beings no longer want to rely on so-called providential favour.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..182"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=182 type=paragraph -->Individual heroism is about to lose its vibrant spirit. Nowadays people have learned that if the thrill of victory is due to anyone, it certainly belongs to humanity. About seven hundred years ago the Asian poet Can&#x301;d&#x301;iida&#x301;sa, from an obscure corner of Bengal, sang about the same great possibility:<!-- /block --></p>

Europe, Africa, Australia, Mercury, Jupiter, the stars, the comets, the constellations &ndash; none of them is alien to the other, none is distant from another. Gradually everyone has begun to realize the vibration of the One Integral Mind. It is my firm conviction that the future of humanity is not dark. Every human beings will attain that inextinguishable flame that is forever alight beyond the veil of the darkness of the present &ndash; and attain it they must. Those who will carry the message of that effulgent light will be forever revered by all humanity.

<a name="2..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The Aryans were not the original inhabitants of the present India. When the Aryans entered India through the Northwest Frontier Province, they contemptuously called the indigenous population whom they defeated in battle, &ldquo;Ana&#x301;ryas&rdquo; [&ldquo;Non-Aryans&rdquo;]. The appellation &ldquo;Ana&#x301;ryas&rdquo; did not apply to any group in particular, but rather to all the then inhabitants of India in general: the Mongolians, the Austrics and the Dravidians (a mixture of Austric and Negro). My discourse today will give a brief overview of the transformation that occurred in the civilizations of these peoples after the arrival of the Aryans, and of the effect that the Aryan migration had on the Aryans themselves. I will try to concentrate particularly upon the influence of Tantra on the Aryans.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The original home of the Aryans was in the northern part of Central Asia. By descent they were a fair, tall and healthy race. They were people of nomadic nature whose main means of subsistence was hunting. When, however, it became impossible for them to procure enough food by hunting, they started rearing cattle. But the merciless nature of Central Asia made their lives unbearable: snowstorms diminished the numbers both of their people and of their animals, and there was a chronic shortage of animal fodder. Just to survive, they had to spend almost all their time collecting food. Not only did this acute food shortage force them to make unending efforts as a group to collect food and rear cattle, it also led to perpetual inter-group skirmishes and even slaughter.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The constant fighting during this period, this ks&#x301;atriya-dominated era, led to the eventual emergence of a class of intellectuals who greatly assisted the ks&#x301;atriya-dominated society. They provided the ks&#x301;atriya leaders with new inventions and discoveries, and satisfied their mental hunger by sharing their knowledge and wisdom. In the language of the day, these intellectuals were called rs&#x301;is. The group leaders bowed their heads in reverence before these mighty intellectuals and followed the precepts framed by them. The society used to call their ideology A&#x301;rs&#x301;a Dharma [Religion of the Sages].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->There can be no doubt that these rs&#x301;is were wiser and more intelligent than the people of the time. But as script had not yet been invented, there was no means to keep a record of the wise discourses given by the rs&#x301;is. The rs&#x301;is&#146; disciples had no choice but to learn the rs&#x301;is&#146; discourses by heart as they were being spoken. Since the discourses were memorized upon being heard, they were called shruti [literally, &ldquo;ear&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The level of intelligence of the Aryan mass at that time was so low that it hardly merits any mention. Actually, they were unable to understand these profound discourses, and as a consequence called them veda, meaning &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo;. They believed that the innovative rs&#x301;is and intellectual munis were not men of ordinary stuff, but superior beings who heard the words of wisdom directly from the mouths of the gods. They also called them dras&#x301;t&#x301;a [seers], as they &ldquo;saw&rdquo; with their own eyes the supernatural phenomena that they talked about, and uttered with their own mouths the benign incantations and mantras which produced those phenomena. Thus, every composer of the Vedic mantras was called a seer, and not a writer or composer. Generally, people believed that the composers of the Vedas were not men but veritable gods.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Even though the Vedas were considered as the creations of God and as such infallible, theism or spirituality was not fully awakened among the Aryans of that time. They only sang hymns and eulogies to appease the different natural forces.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->In that age of undeveloped science they thought that smoke and the clouds in the sky were the same thing. That was why they burned ghee in sacrificial fires: they wanted to make smoke out of it to propitiate the different gods. They believed that the smoke would soar into the sky and turn into clouds; that rain would pour down from the clouds and nourish the earth causing an abundance of trees, plants and grass to sprout forth; and that their domestic animals, strengthened by the fresh grass, would multiply. That was why yajin&#x32D;as [sacrifices] were very common among the different groups and tribes. Those simple people believed that some gods would be propitiated by ghee, some by wine, and some by animal blood.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Human nature is such that one thinks that what is dear to oneself must be dear to everybody. So the ghee-, meat- and wine-loving Aryans thought that such food items would be liked by the gods also. Thus, after each inter-clan war, the chief of the conquering clan would offer that clan&#146;s favourite food to the gods, either in Ashvamedha Yajin&#x32D;a [Horse Sacrifice] or in Gomedha Yajin&#x32D;a [Cow Sacrifice] or in Ra&#x301;jasu&#x301;ya Yajin&#x32D;a [sacrifice performed by a sovereign ruler], etc.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="2..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->All their gods and goddesses were laokik figures [creations of the people]. They arose out of the peoples&#146; worldly needs. Hence the storm, the thunder, the lightning, the rain, the sun, and the moon were all their gods. In that era of undeveloped science what they feared most was the darkness of night, so they not only regarded the night and the evening as their gods, they actually revered them as well. In their fear, they would try to escape from the darkness by making fire with flint. They would never dare to displease the night and the evening, so whenever they made a fire they would first make obeisance to the evening with the fire before doing anything else. At night&#146;s end, when the eastern horizon glowed red, the Aryans would sing the song of the dawn in unison. Arun&#x301;a, the mythological charioteer of the sun&#146;s seven-horsed chariot (the seven horses corresponding to the seven distinct colours of the sun&#146;s rays), was also their god, as, indeed, was the sun itself.<!-- /block --></p>

In the Aryan language of that time, wine was often called &ldquo;honey&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->The oldest portion of the Vedas, that is, the Rgveda, was composed outside India. The remaining portions, that is, the Yajurveda and Atharvaveda, were partly Indian and partly non-Indian. Sa&#x301;maveda is not a separate Veda by itself but is the compilation of the lyrical and musical portions of the different Vedas. So only the Rgveda can be regarded as an ancient relic of the non-Indian Aryan civilization. The Yajurveda was composed in Iran, Afghanistan, northwest India and certain parts of what is modern Russia, so it cannot be called entirely non-Indian, particularly since the then Afghanistan (Ga&#x301;ndha&#x301;r) and certain parts of Russia were regarded as part of India at that time.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="2..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->The Atharvaveda was initially composed in India. During the composition of this Veda the Aryans came in close contact with the non-Aryans, resulting in an exchange of thought between the two.

<a name="2..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Being non-Aryan, the Atharvaveda cannot be regarded as a representation of Aryan civilization.

<a name="2..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->The migrating Aryans first settled in the hilly valleys of northern India. Although there was not much intermixture of blood between the Aryans and the inhabitants of this area, the Aryans were greatly influenced by non-Aryan culture. The Aryans settled down in this area, which was known as Kash (or Khash) after defeating its ancient non-Aryan inhabitants. Using the original name, Kash, they renamed the area &ldquo;Kashmeru&rdquo; or &ldquo;Kashmiira&rdquo; [Kashmir]. Although the Aryans of Kashmiira did not give up their Vedic study, in the spiritual field they did cultivate the indigenous Indian Tantra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->As the southern part of Kashmiira was littered with pebbles resembling the jambu fruit [Eugenia jambolana Lam], the Aryans named it &ldquo;Jambu Dviipa&rdquo; (modern Jammu). Subsequently, Jambu Dviipa came to mean the whole of India. Possibly in the sandy beds of the many rivers that transect Jambu Dviipa they discovered gold for the first time, and so gold came to be known as ja&#x301;mbunada. When still later they settled throughout the entire land of India, they realized that it was ideal not only for habitation, but also for self-development. Thus they named it &ldquo;Bha&#x301;ratavars&#x301;a&rdquo;. Bhara means &ldquo;that which feeds&rdquo;; ta means &ldquo;that which gives&rdquo;, or &ldquo;that which helps in the process of expansion&rdquo;; and vars&#x301;a means &ldquo;a vast stretch of land&rdquo;. Thus, bha&#x301;ratavars&#x301;a means &ldquo;a vast expanse of land which helps in the all-round development of its inhabitants&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->The Aryans did not have their own script and thus were first introduced to the [written] alphabet after coming in contact with the Dravidians. The Dravidians of the Harappa and Mahenjodaro civilizations of India were already using a script, the Saendhavii script; after the Aryan migration into India, that script became transformed into the Bra&#x301;hmii and Kharos&#x301;t&#x301;hi scripts.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->The inconvenience that the non-Indian Aryans had faced for want of script no doubt disappeared after the Indianized Aryans learned it, but owing to their old superstitions, most of the Aryans were reluctant to put the Vedas in black and white. They refused to believe that the reason that the Vedas were not written at the time of their composition was simply the lack of script. They adhered to their illogical reasoning even after the scripts came into being: they thought that the rs&#x301;is had not written out the Vedas, one, because it was improper, and two, because the Vedas were named shruti. However, much later, in Kashmiira,<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.2.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#2.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> the Vedas were written down in the Sa&#x301;rada&#x301; script in use there at the time. There was really no alternative to writing them down, because there was almost nobody left who knew all the Vedas by heart, and the number of people who knew even parts of them was very small.  When the Kashmiira  scholars  finally did write down the Vedas, it was discovered that many parts of them were missing for good.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->It was not difficult for the healthy, martial, almost invincible Aryans to conquer northern India. The victorious Aryans treated the vanquished non-Aryans as slaves, trampling them underfoot to the bottom of their trivarn&#x301;a [three-caste] society &ndash; their society of Bra&#x301;hman&#x301;as, Ks&#x301;atriyas and Vaeshyas. There the non-Aryans became the fourth class, or Shu&#x301;dra Varn&#x301;a, while society became a ca&#x301;turvarn&#x301;a [four-caste] society. In the beginning the Aryans tried their utmost to avoid blood relationships with the Shu&#x301;dras &ndash; overwhelming proof of this is found in the Vedas and later books &ndash; but eventually it became impossible for them to avoid intermixture.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->Although in northern India the Aryans enjoyed predominance in the political sphere, the non-Aryans&#146; influence in the social sphere gradually increased, and persists even today. It was not possible for the Aryans to extend their political power into southern India. There they did exert some social influence, but even less than in the north.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->The courage, strength and physical beauty of the Aryans was conspicuous in the north, south and east of India, so in these areas, the non-Aryans were very eager to establish social relations with the Aryans, and often proudly called themselves A&#x301;rya-Vipras [Vipra = Bra&#x301;hman&#x301;a, or Brahman], A&#x301;rya-Ks&#x301;atriyas or A&#x301;rya-Vaeshyas. Although the Aryans&#146; predominance was mainly political, and the non-Aryans maintained social and cultural predominance, the Aryan influence over the language spread everywhere. Moreover, the influential leaders of society everywhere began to introduce themselves as Aryans. The anti-Aryan sentiment gradually weakened, causing a widespread inferiority complex to take root among the non-Aryan population. This inferiority complex proved extremely detrimental to the interests of the non-Aryans.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->The Aryan leader Agastya was the first to go to southern India to popularize the ideas and ideals of the Aryans. He explained the greatness of the Aryans to the people there allegorically. According to this mythological tale, Vindhya Hill on the northern frontier of the Deccan bent its head out of reverence for Agastya, enabling him to cross into southern India, and has kept its head bent in reverence ever since. The great epic Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a depicts the Aryan invasion of southern India. Needless to say, the monkeys of Kis&#x301;kindhya&#x301; and the ra&#x301;ks&#x301;asas [demons] of Lanka, as described in the Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a, were in fact neither monkeys nor demons, but the people of different sub-castes of the Dravidian society itself. The proof that the non-Aryans, particularly the Dravidians, were a highly developed community in regard to knowledge, learning, intellect, city and town building, cultivation of science, and social order and discipline, is traceable in every line of the Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a. It was extremely difficult for the Aryans to hold their own in an intellectual duel with the Dravidians. At every step they found themselves outwitted, and said, &ldquo;Queer are the ways of demons.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->As a result of co-existing with the non-Aryans for a long time, the Aryans learned many things from them. In fact there is hardly anything of Aryanism left in them today. Of course, the non-Aryans also took on certain Aryan traits, among them their fair complexion, their proficiency in various activities, and their ostentatious lifestyle. From the non-Aryans the Aryans acquired a well-knit social system, a subtle insight, spiritual philosophy and Tantra sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. In the beginning the Aryans tried hard to preserve the purity of their blood &ndash; Shu&#x301;dras used to be kept scrupulously at arm&#146;s length &ndash; but such endeavours and precautions eventually proved a failure. More or less everywhere in India there was intermixing between the Aryans and the non-Aryans &ndash; the Dravidians, the Austrics, and the Mongolians - which resulted in a new mixed race. This is why dark Vipras and fair Shu&#x301;dras are not at all rare in India today. Their very colours pay testimony to the intermixture of Aryan and non-Aryan blood running in their veins.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->The victorious Aryans, coming from cold countries, were a skilled and competent race. Their competence, their sense of superiority over the non-Aryans, and their unity born out of hatred for the non-Aryans, helped them in their victory over India. Though the non-Aryans were defeated by the Aryans in northern India, though the non-Aryans of southern and eastern India were under the spell of an inferiority complex, none of them surrendered to the Aryans without a fight. As they were constantly engaged in warfare with the Aryans, they became much more proficient in battle. Thus Aryan victory in southern and eastern India eventually became impossible. In the accounts of major battles fought between the Aryans and the non-Aryans, as depicted in the Sanskrit books written in the subsequent period,<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.2.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#2.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> the non-Aryans display no less competence than the Aryans.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->Aryan life was full of noisy revelry and pomp, whereas the non-Aryan life was simple and unostentatious, although it was the non-Aryans who had access to more materials of enjoyment. But when the non-Aryans came in contact with the Aryans, they became tempted to enjoy pomp and splendour. Such a lifestyle  proved more  harmful to the  comparatively inactive non-Aryans, inhabitants of a tropical country, than to the active and hardy Aryans.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->The Aryans outside India had no well-structured social system nor any clearly-defined marital discipline. &ldquo;Might is right&rdquo; was the order of society. Nevertheless there was a predisposition in them to mould a society. The non-Aryans had happy families. They were characterized by a well-knit social structure and strong conjugal relationships. Even those nature-worshipping ethnic groups forming part of the Austric population of non-Aryan society, though comparatively backward, had very strong family relationships. So when the Aryans came in contact with these non-Aryans, they found new light for the formation of a society.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->With the exception of a few munis and rs&#x301;is, the militant (ks&#x301;atriya-predominant) Aryans used to view the world with an extoversial outlook. After major battles they would kill the men of the conquered community, employ their children as servants, and either marry the women or employ them as maid-servants. For that reason there was a large number of male and female slaves in their society.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->War-loving races are generally careful to honour the rules and laws of war, and frame new laws to suit the convenience of warring armies. Thus, the Aryans displayed a commendable sense of discipline during war. Being a war-loving race, it was but natural for them to do so. The non-Aryans, however, were backward in this regard. During their battles with the Aryans they did not respect the rules and laws of war (such as not to strike at the defenceless, not to employ more than one fighter against another, not to kill a retreating or surrendering soldier or a soldier begging for mercy). Not only was this highly irritating to the Aryans; the lack of a disciplined military mentality was actually one of the main reasons for the non-Aryans&#146; defeat.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->Usually the non-Aryans were content with little. What was developed in them was their introspective nature, which not only made them devotees of God, but infused in them a surging love for spiritual philosophy. The religious practices of the Aryans, however, entailed performing certain sacrifices in order to attain certain materialistic gains. That is, their religious observances were mainly ritualistic. On the whole, the non-Aryans were followers of Tantra, or subjective sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. Of course the non-Aryans, depending on their different degrees of intellectual development, ranged all the way from animists to Brahma sa&#x301;dhakas [intuitional practitioners whose goal is the Absolute]; but in general, individual sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; ranked very high. The religion of the Vedic Aryans was, as a rule, one of prayer. It did not include even the subtlest hint of any intuitional meditation. And here lies the difference between the Brahmava&#x301;da of the Vedas and the Upanishads on the one hand, and that of Tantra on the other.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..36"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph -->As previously mentioned, by &ldquo;non-Aryans&rdquo; no particular ethnic group was meant. When the Aryans first migrated to India, the non-Aryans were, on the whole, divided into three populations. Of these, the Negro-Austric Dravidians were the most developed intellectually and spiritually. Their Tantra sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; bore a predominance of jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na and bhakti. The next groups deserving mention are those of the Mongolian population. In their Tantra sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, karma and bhakti were predominant. The groups which constituted the Austric population were almost equal to the Aryans intellectually, but in the practical and spiritual spheres they gradually lagged behind due to the comparative lack of dynamism of their society. This Austric society was content to practise the extroversial aspects of Tantra (witchcraft, invultuation, magic, magical incantation for evil purposes, hypnotism, etc.)<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="2..40"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=40 type=paragraph -->Bengal was the home of both the Mongolian and the Dravidian populations, the Dravidians being more widespread in the southwestern areas and the Mongolians in the northeastern areas. Some groups of Austrics lived in the western parts. In the southeastern parts of Bengal, the Mongolians held an overwhelming majority over the Dravidians. The Chakmas, Tripuris, Bodos, Kochas, Kiratas, and Chuaras of the Mongolian population; the Kaevarttas, Bagdis, Dules, Shavaras, Kurmis, Mahatas, and Kherias of the Dravidian population; and the Santhaliis, Baoriis, Ma&#x301;la Pa&#x301;ha&#x301;riis [[(Ma&#x301;la or Ma&#x301;lo)]], etc., of the predominantly Austric population, were the original Bengalees.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..41"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=41 type=paragraph -->The present Bengali society and civilization are the outcome of the mutual exchange of thought among these peoples. The greatest contribution of this civilization has been the well-structured and well-disciplined Tantra sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. Tantra wields the greatest influence over the customs and usages of modern Bengal and eastern India. As a matter of fact, Tantra has had a more pervasive influence throughout all of India than have the Vedas, yet nowhere has this Tantric or non-Aryan influence been greater than in the eastern part of India. The iron bangles of the women, the vermilion mark in the parting of their hair, the various marriage customs and rites, etc., are all different social practices borrowed from the non-Aryans. The custom of addressing all women as &ldquo;mother&rdquo; (masiima&#x301;, pisiima&#x301;, ka&#x301;kiima&#x301; [aunts], didima&#x301; [grandmother], etc.) bears the mark of Tantric influence, because in Tantra the social dominance of women was widely accepted. Even the little non-Tantric or patrilineal influence that exists in the upper castes of Bengali society is not borrowed from the Aryans of northern India, but is a result of the close and intimate trans-oceanic relations that Bengal had in those days with regions outside India.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..42"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=42 type=paragraph -->In the life of Bengal, Tantra has surrendered to Veda only with respect to language. In fact there was no alternative but to acknowledge this defeat: The Bengalees of those days were followers of Tantra who spoke many different languages. When they decided to formulate a new language of their own, they were bound to accept the language of the foreign Aryans due to its highly expressive power. The Dravidian and Mongolian languages [although also a form of Sanskrit] were not so expressive as the Sanskrit language of the Vedas.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..43"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=43 type=paragraph -->Although the Aryan conquerors were unable to influence the social life of Bengal to any appreciable degree, due to their influence the Tantric matrilineal social system of Bengal (the Tantric matrilineal order prevails even today in the Dravid-Keralite and Mongolo-Khashian societies) partially accepted the patrilineal order as well. As a result Bengal, though not governed by the Mita&#x301;ks&#x301;ara&#x301;, or patrilineal, system of northern India, built up a new social order according due respect to both father and mother. Subsequently, in recognition of this new social system, Bengal officially rescinded the Mita&#x301;ks&#x301;ara&#x301; system [insofar as it officially existed], and in its place established the Da&#x301;yabha&#x301;ga<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.2.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#2.fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> system.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..44"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=44 type=paragraph -->The second result of the Aryan influence was the Bengali language. The language that the Bengalees of the Vedic era used to speak had no connection with the Vedic language. Neither could the Vedic Aryans understand it. The Aryans used to say, &ldquo;That is a country of birds. We don&#146;t understand what those birds chirp and twitter.&rdquo; Be that as it may, due the Vedic influence, particularly due to the influence of the eastern Vedic dialect, Ma&#x301;gadhii Pra&#x301;krta, there emerged a Sanskrit-based Aryan language in Bengal. Later on the Tantrics of this area composed Tantric literature using Sanskrit<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.2.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#2.fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> and the new Sanskrit-based Bengali.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..45"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=45 type=paragraph -->In spite of their accepting the Aryan language, the Tantrics never gave up their own style of pronunciation. Even today the Ma&#x301;gadhii group of languages, particularly the Eastern Demi-Ma&#x301;gadhii group (Bengali, Oriya, Assamese and Maethilii), has a style of pronunciation that is completely its own. In spite of later distortions in the mode of pronunciation in northern India, due to the non-cultivation of the Sanskrit language and the heavy use of Arabic- and Persian-influenced Urdu, eastern and southern India did not give up their ancient modes of pronunciation. In ancient times the people speaking Shaorasenii and Ma&#x301;lavii dialects used to make fun of the people speaking the Ma&#x301;gadhii dialect, which was heavily influenced by Tantra. Thus the people of the western part of the Ma&#x301;gadhii-speaking area, that is, the Magahii- and Bhojpuri-speaking people, tried to pronounce in the Shaorasenii style. Though there is, as a result, some influence of Shaorasenii and Hindi on the pronunciation of the Magahii and Bhojpuri dialects, the intonation of the sam&#x301;vrta<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.2.fn5"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#2.fn5">5</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> a has remained unchanged. The Tantric pronunciations of jin&#x32D;a, n&#x301;a, s&#x301;a, hya, and ks&#x301;a are also still prevalent in eastern India today.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..46"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=46 type=paragraph -->The Aryans had a developed language but no script. It was indeed the Tantrics, and not the Vedics, who invented script and acoustic science. So far as correctness of pronunciation is concerned, the Tantric mode is to be accepted, not the Vedic. Remember that each of the fifty letters of the Sanskrit aks&#x301;arama&#x301;la&#x301; [alphabet] constitutes one acoustic root of Tantra. It was for the purpose of spiritual practice that the Tantrics had discovered these roots. Here the Aryans deserve no credit at all.<!-- /block --></p>

Betels, plantains, areca nuts and coconuts [as used to worship Satyana&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a] are the main paraphernalia of non-Aryan worship, because they are Dravidian in origin. Perhaps the Vedic Aryans had never heard of these things, and perhaps there were no words for them in the Vedic language or in old Sanskrit. Words like na&#x301;gavallarii [a kind of creeping plant], kadalii [plaintain] and na&#x301;rikela [coconut] are modern Sanskrit, but these things are widely used in the worship of Satyana&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a and in other popular worship. Only the shirn&#x301;ii [food offered to a god] of the Muslims in the worship of Satyana&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a is imported.<!-- /block --></p>

Another noteworthy fact is that in the Chat&#x301; and a number of other popular pu&#x301;ja&#x301;s, the Vedics or Brahmans have no place at all, or if they do participate, have a secondary role. The women play a most significant role in these pu&#x301;ja&#x301;s. The speciality of non-Aryan ceremonies is that the women&#146;s role is predominant. Yet another remarkable factor is that although the Vedic sun-god is a male god, the non-Aryan sun-god is female, a goddess. Thus in eastern India worshippers address the sun-god as &ldquo;Chat&#x301; Ma&#x301;yii&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;Chat&#x301; Pita&#x301;&rdquo;. The non-Aryan worship of Dalapati or Gan&#x301;apati (group leader or people&#146;s leader) prevalent in the non-Aryan Austric society, is also prevalent in the Aryan society in the name of Gan&#x301;apati Pu&#x301;ja&#x301; or Gan&#x301;esha Pu&#x301;ja&#x301; [actually this worship meant the worship of the group or society of the Austric people]. The head of an elephant, a big and mighty animal, placed on the shoulders of the deity&#146;s body, was only symbolic of the superiority of the group leader of the society concerned. It is noteworthy that such worship was also prevalent in the non-Aryan Mayan civilization of America.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..50"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=50 type=paragraph -->As said before, the Aryans became acquainted with paddy at a much later period. Previously they had had no idea how to get rice out of paddy, and only learned when they came in contact with the non-Aryans. It was the non-Aryans who taught them to eat boiled rice. It is noteworthy that powdered rice or its paste was widely used in the popular worship of the gods and goddesses of south and east India. It would appear that rice seemed to be rather a queer thing to the Aryans, because in the Vedas it is called tan&#x301;d&#x301;ula. Evidently the Aryans saw grains of rice jumping from the mortar while the paddy was being threshed and husked in the traditional hand-driven or foot-driven husking devices, and thus named it tan&#x301;d&#x301;ula. Tan&#x301;d&#x301;ula means &ldquo;one whose characteristic is to jump&rdquo;. The word ca&#x301;l or ca&#x301;ul [husked but uncooked rice] is derived from the Bengali root ca&#x301;la&#x301; &ndash; which means &ldquo;sifting&rdquo; in order to separate the rice from the chaff.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..51"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=51 type=paragraph -->Spiritual practice was common in the Tantric society. There is no spiritual vigour whatsoever in the lives of those who support pompous, so-called religious, ceremonies, as there is in the lives of introspective spiritual practitioners. After the Aryans came into India, two types of practice used to take place side by side: on the one side the sacrificial fires of the rs&#x301;is, characterized by the smell of burning ghee and the sonorous refrains of those paying homage to the manes while offering oblations into the fire; and on the other side, the non-Aryans&#146; Tantra sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, the practice of self-control and attainment of divine power. Spiritual depth and power of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; brought fearlessness into the spiritual lives of the non-Aryans, as befitting staunch Tantrics.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..52"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=52 type=paragraph -->The non-Aryans regarded the Aryans&#146; sacrificial ceremonies as a time-killing childish pastime and would sabotage them whenever convenient. The Aryan munis and rs&#x301;is asked the Aryan kings for protection against these saboteurs &ndash; or, in the language of the Aryans, these ra&#x301;ks&#x301;asas, pashus and pisha&#x301;cas. Innumerable stories to this effect can be found in different Sanskrit books, even today. Although the words ra&#x301;ks&#x301;asa [demon], pashu [beast] and pisha&#x301;ca [ghoul] were used in a general way to describe the non-Aryans, actually the Dravidians were normally called ra&#x301;ks&#x301;asas (the short-statured among them &ldquo;monkeys&rdquo;), the Mongolians, asuras [monsters], and those Tantrics who did shava sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; [sa&#x301;dhan&#x301;a upon dead bodies] in cemeteries and cremation grounds, pisha&#x301;cas. The Aryans also declared that these gangs of ra&#x301;ks&#x301;asas and pisha&#x301;cas were cannibals. They drew horrible sketches of the dark-complexioned Dravidians and high-cheekboned and flat-nosed Mongolians, with grotesque forms and features, to prove them contemptible and vile. Actually they were a lot more civilized and educated than the Aryans.<!-- /block --></p>

Bhiima married Hid&#x301;imba&#x301;, a non-Aryan girl; Arjuna married Citra&#x301;un&#x32D;gada&#x301;, also a non-Aryan girl. Ra&#x301;van&#x301;a, the leader of the ra&#x301;ks&#x301;asas, had a father from an Aryan Brahman family &ndash; Mahars&#x301;i Vishvashrava&#x301;, the descendent of Pulasta Rs&#x301;i &ndash; and a non-Aryan mother &ndash; Nikas&#x301;a&#x301;, or Kaekasii. In other words, though the Aryans had been proud of their colour and features, that pride faded away within a short time. At that time and also later, even though a few Aryan-proud individuals attempted to defame these ra&#x301;ks&#x301;asas and asuras, the general mass did not pay much attention to them.<!-- /block --></p>

Proud of its own speciality and uniqueness, it never agreed to be a part of the A&#x301;rya&#x301;vartta [northern India dominated by the Aryan culture]. In order to keep itself free from Aryan subjugation, Bengal rebelled again and again. The northern Indian orthodox Aryans, full of Aryan chauvinism (actually they too were Tantrics, but outwardly displayed an enamel coating of Aryanism), were reluctant to accept the highly Tantric areas such as Aun&#x32D;ga [Monghyr and its adjacent areas], Vaun&#x32D;ga [Bengal]),<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.2.fn8"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#2.fn8">8</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> Kaliun&#x32D;ga [Orissa], Mithila and Magadha [Bihar] as parts of their A&#x301;ryavartta.

<a name="2..60"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=60 type=paragraph -->These orthodox, but internally Tantric, people could not avoid being influenced by the Tantric civilization of eastern India even in their external life. The predominance of the Bengali script of east India (Shrii Hars&#x301;a Lipi) extended up to Praya&#x301;ga in the far west. Most Sanskrit books on Hindu and Buddhist Tantra were written in this Bengali script. After the Muslim invasion, the influence of east India upon north India began to wane gradually. At about that time some Nagar Brahmans from Vedic Gujarat went to northern India to propagate the Vedas and the Sanskrit language. They used Na&#x301;grii script for writing Sanskrit, and under the Brahmans&#146; influence the Na&#x301;grii script too gradually became popular in northern India. The use of Bengali script became confined to eastern India only. It is worth noting that many of the Na&#x301;gar Brahmans of Gujarat were followers of Tantra, particularly Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava Tantra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..61"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=61 type=paragraph -->The greatest difference between the Aryans and the non-Aryans was in their outlook. The Aryans wanted to establish their dominance on the basis of their racial superiority, whereas the non-Aryans, following the precepts of Tantra, did not recognize any distinction among people. The identity of everyone was the same: all belonged to the same family, the family of Shiva. In the first stage of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, everyone is an animal. To merge in Brahmatva [Cosmic Consciousness], after first elevating themselves to devatva [god-hood], was their sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. But in the first stage, while still rising above crude animality, their adorable Shiva was known as &ldquo;Pashupati&rdquo;, &ldquo;Lord of Animality&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..62"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=62 type=paragraph -->Here it is necessary to remember that Tantra is not a religion, but a way of life, a system of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. The fundamental goal of this sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is to awaken the dormant jiivashakti [unit force], known as kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii, and, after elevating it stage by stage, to merge it in Brahmabha&#x301;va [Cosmic Consciousness]. Tantra is a science of spiritual meditation or sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; which is equally applicable to anyone no matter what their religious affiliation might be. Tantra is certainly older than the Vedas. Just as the shlokas or mantras of the Vedas were handed down from guru to disciple in a genealogical tradition, the Tantra sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; of the Mongolo-Dravidian society was handed down from guru to disciple hereditarily. The Vedas are theoretical &ndash; full of ritualistic ceremonies and formalisms. It would be incorrect to regard Tantra as a more recent version of those Vedic rituals: Tantra&#146;s esoteric practices had long been known in the society of sa&#x301;dhakas. Its theoretical portion was not as elaborate as that of the Vedas, which took years and years to memorize.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..63"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=63 type=paragraph -->When the Aryans came to India, roughly during the period of the Atharvaveda, they learned Tantra sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; to some extent after coming in contact with the Indian Tantrics. This resulted in the Atharvaveda being pervasively influenced by Tantra. Even if the orthodox Vedics try to reject the many Tantra-influenced portions of the Vedas as later interpolations, they will not be too convincing, for Tantra has now infiltrated into the marrow of the so-called Aryans. Although during the post-Vedic Buddhist era as well as the post-Buddhist Brahmanical era changes in the religious outlook of the people were apparent, the process of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; remained Tantric as it does even today, for without Tantra spiritual sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is impossible. Yoga, which is the paramount factor in spiritual practices, is itself based on Tantra. The great Tantric Vashis&#x301;t&#x301;ha, when he returned from China after learning the Chinese techniques of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, brought about a great improvement in Tantra sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. He was widely acclaimed as a great yogi. His book Yogava&#x301;shis&#x301;t&#x301;ha is a philosophical exposition of the subtle spirituality of Tantra sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..64"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=64 type=paragraph -->There are many who try to make a distinction between Hindu Tantra and Buddhist Tantra. This is absolutely wrong, for as I have said earlier, Tantra is one and only one. It is based on one sentiment, on one idea. The Buddhist and Hindu Tantras express the same thing in different words. For example, Hindu Tantras use the word kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii for the dormant unit force and id&#x301;a, piun&#x32D;gala&#x301; and sus&#x301;umna&#x301; for the three psycho-spiritual channels. They state that the kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii pierces through the six cakras &ndash; (1) mu&#x301;la&#x301;dha&#x301;ra [situated above the perineum], (2) sva&#x301;dhis&#x301;t&#x301;ha&#x301;na [in the region of the genital organ], (3) man&#x301;ipura [in the region of the navel], (4) ana&#x301;hata [in the region of the heart], (5) vishuddha [in the region of the vocal cord] and (6) a&#x301;jin&#x32D;a&#x301; [between the eyebrows], and finally unites with Paramashiva at the seventh cakra, the sahasra&#x301;ra cakra [at the crown of the head], giving the sa&#x301;dhakas, or intuitional practitioners, the bliss of Cosmic Consciousness. The Buddhist Tantras say the same thing in different words. They have named the man&#x301;ipura cakra, nirma&#x301;n&#x301;a cakra, the ana&#x301;hata, dharma cakra, the vishuddha, sambhoga cakra, and the sahasra&#x301;ra, us&#x301;niis&#x301;a kamala or maha&#x301;sukha cakra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..65"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=65 type=paragraph -->Some have named the mu&#x301;la&#x301;dha&#x301;ra, man&#x301;ipadma.

The so-called Buddhist Tantrics also say, On&#x32D;m&#x301; man&#x301;ipadme hummm.

So where, in reality, is the ideological difference between the Hindu Tantras such as Maha&#x301;nirva&#x301;n&#x301;a Tantra, Kula&#x301;rn&#x301;ava Tantra, Ajin&#x32D;a&#x301;na-bodhinii Tantra, Jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na-sam&#x301;kalinii Tantra, Rudraya&#x301;mala Tantra, Bhaerava-ya&#x301;mala Tantra, Niila Tantra, etc., and the Buddhist Tantras such as Hevajra Tantra, Vajra-va&#x301;ra&#x301;hii Kalpamaha&#x301; Tantra, Ekallaviira Can&#x301;d&#x301;aros&#x301;an&#x301;a Tantra, D&#x301;a&#x301;ka&#x301;rnava Tantra, Advaya Siddhi Tantra, etc.?

And the goddess of vajra shu&#x301;nyata&#x301;, of the unmanifest Prakrti, is Vajrava&#x301;ra&#x301;hii, D&#x301;ombii, Naera&#x301;tma Devii or Naera&#x301;man&#x301;i in the language of the Buddhists. The different stages of savikalpa sama&#x301;dhi related to the upward movement of the kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii are called sa&#x301;lokya [within the same loka], sa&#x301;miipya [closest proximity], sa&#x301;rupya [identity], sars&#x301;t&#x301;hi [the stage between savikalpa and nirvikalpa], etc., in the Hindu Tantras; and in the Buddhist Tantras, vis&#x301;a&#x301;ya&#x301;nanda [objective bliss] in the nirma&#x301;n&#x301;a cakra, parama&#x301;nanda [supreme bliss] in the dharma cakra, vira&#x301;ma&#x301;nanda [intermittent bliss] in the sambhoga cakra and sahaja&#x301;nanda [absolute bliss] in the maha&#x301;sukha cakra. In this maha&#x301;sukha cakra, Naera&#x301;tma Devii is Bhagavatii Prajin&#x32D;a&#x301; Sarveshvarii, an embodiment of sahaja&#x301;nanda [bliss]. This sahaja&#x301;nanda is the Brahma&#x301;nanda [absolute bliss] of the Hindu Tantras.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..82"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=82 type=paragraph -->After the Aryan settlement in India a great man was born into the non-Aryan society. Born into a Mongolo-Aryan family, this great man had a high nose and fair complexion. He was a great Tantric - a great yogi. The name of this Maha&#x301;purus&#x301;a of the non-Aryan society was Shiva. For one man to have so many qualities and endowments at the same time was beyond the comprehension of the people, so He was called Gun&#x301;a&#x301;tiita or Nirgun&#x301;a [Transcendental or Non-Attributional] Purus&#x301;a. As the result of His Tantra sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; He attained extraordinary powers, which He employed for the good of humanity. It was He who systematized the science of Tantra and thus He was the guru or the father of Tantrics and yogis. To this Self-realized Maha&#x301;purus&#x301;a there was no distinction of high and low. People of all classes, from the highest to the lowest, were dear to Him. Irrespective of class - Aryan, non-Aryan, Dravidian, Austric or Mongolian &ndash; all flocked to Him. He showered His grace on them all equally. As the battles raged between the &ldquo;gods&rdquo; on the one hand and the &ldquo;demons&rdquo; and &ldquo;monsters&rdquo; on the other (needless to say, &ldquo;gods&rdquo; meant the handsome Aryan leaders, and &ldquo;demons&rdquo; meant the non-Aryans in general), the non-Aryan &ldquo;demons&rdquo; and &ldquo;monsters&rdquo; became more and more powerful through the blessings of this Shiva. All the ra&#x301;ks&#x301;asas and asuras were Shiva&#146;s obedient devotees and followers. With the help and blessings of Shiva they destroyed the might and power of the &ldquo;gods&rdquo;. According to Sanskrit stories, when the gods would seek the help of Brahma&#x301; and Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u, even those two would not dare to oppose Shiva; rather they would save the gods through a compromise with Him.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..83"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=83 type=paragraph -->Shiva had such a forgiving nature, born out of His spirit of benevolence, that even the most wicked could easily draw on His kindness. That is why to everybody He became &ldquo;A&#x301;shutos&#x301;a&rdquo; (&ldquo;Easy to Please&rdquo;). Due to Shiva&#146;s pervasive influence over their society, the non-Aryans, that is, the Tantrics, used to worship Him as God, and according to their respective intellectual strata they regarded and accepted Him in His different bearings. Just as the Aryans began to identify Shiva with their own gods and goddesses, the kaola maha&#x301;ta&#x301;ntrikas [great Tantrics in the tradition of kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii yoga] began to regard their Shiva as identical with Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma. The foremost cause behind this conception of theirs was the absolute detachment and self-forgetful bearing of Shiva, the lord of supernatural and miraculous power. Shiva&#146;s self-sacrificing nature earned Him the name &ldquo;Bhola&#x301;na&#x301;tha&rdquo; [&ldquo;one absolutely indifferent to his own status&rdquo;] among the non-Aryans. All were attracted to Shiva&#146;s supernatural power, His imposing personality, His limitless qualities and the calm, tranquil radiance of His features.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..84"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=84 type=paragraph -->Enthralled by the physical grace and the virtues of Shiva, Princess Gaorii, the daughter of the Aryan king Daks&#x301;a, was attracted towards Him. King Daks&#x301;a was not at all in favour of his daughter marrying a non-Aryan, but eventually he gave way before her adamant attitude. And so Shiva and Princess Gaorii were married. But envy born out of his knowledge of Shiva&#146;s formidable influence over both the Aryan and the non-Aryan societies had already made King Daks&#x301;a mad. Thus one day he publicly insulted Shiva at a large sacrifice specially planned for the purpose. Shiva&#146;s devotees, unable to bear the insult, made a pandemonium of Daks&#x301;a&#146;s ceremonial sacrifice. It is written in the books of the Aryans that Shiva&#146;s two servant-spirits, Nandii and Bhrngii, destroyed Daks&#x301;a&#146;s yajin&#x32D;a. Actually, Nandii and Bhrngii, the alleged spirits, were none other than two ardent non-Aryan Tantric devotees of Shiva.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..85"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=85 type=paragraph -->Many Aryans supported the marriage of Gaorii and Shiva, because, on account of Shiva&#146;s extraordinary influence, they felt it would be more in their interest to establish kinship with Him than to remain hostile to Him. Whatever the reason, after Daks&#x301;a&#146;s yajin&#x32D;a, in Shiva&#146;s presence, all the Aryan and non-Aryan clashes and disputes came to a permanent end. In other words, the Aryans accepted the predominance of Shiva.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..86"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=86 type=paragraph -->The non-Aryans were very happy to have Gaorii in their midst. Just as they revered Shiva as their god, they regarded Gaorii as their goddess. The non-Aryans were yellow-, black- or brown-complexioned, but Gaorii, being of purely Aryan origin, was white-complexioned. It was for this reason that she was named &ldquo;Gaorii&rdquo; [which means &ldquo;white-complexioned&rdquo;]. After the marriage, Gaorii lived in the Himalaya Mountains, and was thus often called &ldquo;Parvata Kanya&#x301;&rdquo; [&ldquo;Daughter of the Mountains&rdquo;], or &ldquo;Pa&#x301;rvatii&rdquo; in common language. I told you a little while ago that the non-Aryans used to do Tantra sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; according to their respective intellectual development. They worshipped a pair of gods &ndash; Purus&#x301;a and Prakrti. Whatever their intellectual and spiritual standards, all of them regarded their primary god as Shiva, or, in subsequent periods, some avata&#x301;ra [incarnation] of Shiva; and their primary goddess as Gaorii, or, later, some partial manifestation of Gaorii.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..87"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=87 type=paragraph -->Among the backward non-Aryan society, phallus worship was prevalent. Although originally there was some social history behind this phallus worship (due to the perpetual warfare between the various clans and tribes, each group felt a constant necessity to increase its numerical strength, and thus they began to worship both the genital organs), in later periods, under the influence of Tantra, it took on a more subtle spiritual form. When, due to the influence of Shiva, everyone began to accept Shiva as their chief god, this liun&#x32D;ga pu&#x301;ja&#x301; [worship of genitals] became [the worship of] Shiva-liun&#x32D;ga and Gaorii-piit&#x301;ha, or Gaorii-pat&#x301;t&#x301;a. Subsequently the Aryans also accepted phallus worship and gave it a philosophical interpretation: Liun&#x32D;gate gamyate yasma&#x301;d talliun&#x32D;gam [&ldquo;The entity from which all things originate [[and towards which all things are moving]] is called liun&#x32D;ga&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..88"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=88 type=paragraph -->After Daks&#x301;a&#146;s yajin&#x32D;a Shiva&#146;s influence over the Aryans increased more and more. The Aryans began to feel that, being so indebted to Shiva, they could no longer afford to disregard Him. It was Shiva who had taught them spiritual sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, a&#x301;sanas and pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;ya&#x301;ma; the secret of good health; the science of medicine; and the developed art of dance and music. For His excellence in dancing, both the Aryans and non-Aryans used to call Him &ldquo;Nat&#x301;ara&#x301;ja&rdquo;, and for His proficiency in vocal music, &ldquo;Na&#x301;datanu&rdquo;. No one has counted the number of medicines He invented for every kind of disease. He was the first preceptor of the a&#x301;yurveda&#x301;ca&#x301;ryas [teachers of a&#x301;yurveda, the science of medicine to increase longevity]. The asuras were cured of many serious diseases due to His grace. Both the Aryans and the non-Aryans thought that since Shiva knew so many remedies, He was perhaps immortal, and so they named Him &ldquo;Mrtyuin&#x32D;jaya&rdquo; [&ldquo;Conqueror of Death&rdquo;]. When, even today, people come across some incurable disease, they say, &ldquo;Even Shiva has no cure for this disease.&rdquo; Like the non-Aryans, the Aryans eventually accepted Shiva as their god and Gaorii as their goddess.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..89"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=89 type=paragraph -->The tiger is one of the oldest animals of India. In the distant past these tigers came into India from the non-Aryan countries of China, Tibet, etc. Lions came much later from the Aryan countries bordering on the northwest corner of India. It is noteworthy that in the dhya&#x301;na mantra of Shiva, he has been described as wearing a tiger skin, that is, the skin of an animal of the non-Aryan countries (vya&#x301;ghra-krttim&#x301; vasa&#x301;nam&#x301;); and the daughter of the Aryans, Gaorii, has been depicted as sim&#x301;ha-va&#x301;hinii [&ldquo;riding on a lion&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..90"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=90 type=paragraph -->In all the Aryan books of knowledge the word Shiva was invariably used to describe Parama Purus&#x301;a. The racially chauvinistic Aryans could not remain at peace after their acceptance of Shiva as God. Thinking that the non-Aryans would make capital of this and boast about their triumph over the Aryans, they threw themselves into the task of proving that Shiva was an Aryan. The non-Aryan Shiva used to live in cemeteries, cremation grounds, lonesome plains and on the different peaks of the Himalayas. (That is why even today the non-Aryans, pointing to the Himalayan peaks such as Kailash, Gaurishankar, Everest, etc., say, &ldquo;There live our Hara-Gaorii.&rdquo;) But the Aryans turned Him into a full-fledged divinity of the scriptures. To prove that he was Aryan they hung a sacred thread on his left shoulder. (Needless to say, the non-Aryan Shiva had no such sacred thread; he wore a snake around his neck.) Strangely enough, the image of the Aryan god Brahma&#x301; shows no sign of any such sacred thread. No one doubted that Brahma&#x301; was an Aryan by race, but in the case of Shiva, the only way to prove that he was an Aryan was to hang a sacred thread on his shoulder.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..91"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=91 type=paragraph -->We can still observe today that Shiva is the god of all, regardless of caste or colour, high or low, learned or ignorant, Brahman or pariah. No other deity in India enjoys such tremendous universal popularity. Even if one does not know a mantra, one can worship Shiva. Young maidens model earth into images of Shiva and worship Him; the philosophical sa&#x301;dhakas of old used to attain sama&#x301;dhi in Shivatva [Cosmic Consciousness]; and the so-called low castes such as Dom&#x301;a and Can&#x301;d&#x301;a&#x301;la become sannya&#x301;siis of Shiva. No other divinity would even touch the shadows of these so-called pariahs.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..92"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=92 type=paragraph -->The present social system of India (which is fundamentally Tantric) was developed by Shiva. After accepting Shiva as God without any reservation, the Aryans appropriated everything good of the Dravidians and the other non-Aryans. Of course this did not diminish the Aryans&#146; prestige &ndash; rather it enhanced it. After this appropriation there was a propaganda attempt to prove that Tantra was originally propounded by the Aryans themselves. The Aryans used to say:<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="2..94"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=94 type=paragraph -->That is to say, &ldquo;This Tantra, or A&#x301;gama Sha&#x301;stra, was actually composed by Va&#x301;sudeva [Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, who was considered Aryan], and Shiva only revealed it to Pa&#x301;rvatii.&rdquo; A&#x301;re Ba&#x301;ba&#x301;!<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.2.fn11"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#2.fn11">11</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> &ndash; if Va&#x301;sudeva had at all been the propounder of this doctrine, why on earth would He have put it into the mouth of the non-Aryan Shiva instead of saying it Himself? In the beginning the Aryans used to recognize the superiority of Tantra sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; but practise it in secret; but after acknowledging Shiva, they openly declared themselves to be Tantrics.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..95"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=95 type=paragraph -->Not only in India, but in quite a large part of the world, in every sphere of life, the laws and injunctions of Shiva alone prevailed for a long time. Even today the civilization of modern India is intrinsically Tantric. On the outside only is there a Vedic stamp. Or if we take the Indian civilization as an enamelled ornament, then its gold is Tantric, and the enamel Vedic. For both the wandering sannya&#x301;siis of the cemeteries and cremation grounds, and the householders, this Shiva alone is the ideal man, and Gaorii the ideal woman. Shiva is the universal father and Gaorii the universal mother. Shiva&#146;s household is the three worlds.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..96"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=96 type=paragraph -->Hararme pita&#x301; Gaorii ma&#x301;ta&#x301; svadesho bhuvanatrayam.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="2..98"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=98 type=paragraph -->When the Indians were about to forget the teachings of Shiva due to their fascination with the mundane objectivities of the world, there came another sublime entity like Shiva, who reminded them of those teachings. That great personality was Shrii Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. The question as to which of the two was greater, Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a or Shiva, does not arise, because all knowers of Brahma are one: all are Brahma. Shrii Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a was the supreme teacher and ideal politician of  the  world, what to speak of India alone. Shiva was the guru, the father, of the human society of the world &ndash; a completely different kind of role. Shiva is the universal father. Just as Ca&#x301;nda&#x301; Ma&#x301;ma&#x301; [The Uncle in the Moon] is the uncle of all, Shiva is the father of all.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..99"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=99 type=paragraph -->All three worlds are Shiva&#146;s family. His reputation is not confined to any particular country. Yet if anyone is to be singled out as the father of Indian civilization, or of Indian society, or of the so-called Indian nation &ndash; then I can say emphatically that Shiva alone is eligible to be the father, not only of the Indian nation, but of the universal human nation. Ancient Shiva alone, and no one else, can qualify to be the father of this more-than-five-thousand-year-old so-called Indian race.<!-- /block --></p>
