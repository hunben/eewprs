<a name="1..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->There are many people who dislike hero-worship, and then again, there are many people who only say that they dislike it, although they actually do like it. It is an ingrained human trait that generally people do not have sufficient courage to undertake those tasks that require courage. But if someone takes the lead courageously, then others will cooperate. When a brave person comes forward, other people become brave due to his or her example. This is also an ingrained human trait. That is why whenever a righteous person undertakes a noble cause, honest people willingly extend their unstinting cooperation to him or her. Hero-worship of this sort is quite natural. If anyone opposes this natural thing, it should be understood that he or she suffers from a fear complex and criticizes hero-worship just to hide it.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Hero-worship does not necessarily mean, however, that whatever a great person does should be blindly supported. As previously said, when a virtuous person courageously undertakes a noble cause, it is but natural that other people will extend their support. It is a natural human trait.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->We see in Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi an expression of [the qualities that elicit] that trait in a powerful way. He was a true representative of the hopes and aspirations of good people, that is, of people devoted to the Lord. Who is that entity who fulfils the hopes and aspirations of devoted people, of righteous and virtuous people (the hopes and aspirations of virtuous people generally are virtuous and good)? It is Parama Purus&#x301;a who does so. Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi stole the hearts and minds of people in the past and continues to do so today.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->In my last discourse I was discussing Maha&#x301;vis&#x301;n&#x301;uva&#x301;da. I said that if the sparks coming out of the original fire merge again in their source it is not a matter of sorrow but a matter of joy. But if the sparks lose themselves forever in the yawning chasms of darkness, there cannot be any greater sorrow. This getting lost forever is termed pran&#x301;a&#x301;sha [total annihilation] in Sanskrit. They are lost forever and cannot return to the original source.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->In Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi&#146;s teachings there is no mention whatsoever of this pran&#x301;a&#x301;sha. Even regarding the most sinful people He said, Paritra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;ya sa&#x301;dhu&#x301;na&#x301;m&#x301; vina&#x301;sha&#x301;ya ca dus&#x301;krta&#x301;m [&ldquo;(I have come) for the protection of the virtuous and the destruction of the wicked&rdquo;]. Here He talks of vina&#x301;sha [destruction], not pran&#x301;a&#x301;sha. What is the meaning of vina&#x301;sha? It means a vishis&#x301;t&#x301;a [special] form of na&#x301;sha. And na&#x301;sha means change of form from an undeveloped form to a more developed one. In this process something is apparently destroyed, but actually is metamorphosed into something better. For example, the ugly silkworm, when it leaves its cocoon, is metamorphosed into a beautiful butterfly. The silkworm has not met its total annihilation but has simply undergone a change for the better. Vina&#x301;sha&#x301;ya ca dus&#x301;krta&#x301;m&#x301; [&ldquo;for the destruction of the wicked&rdquo;]. Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi never looked upon anyone as His enemy or as an object of hatred, not even the most wicked people. However, if people were antisocial, if they harmed others and became a cause of immense terror, He destroyed them. Why does this destruction occur? Not to send them to eternal darkness but to destroy the Ravana<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.1.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#1.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> in them, so that they could acquire a better human form.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Although Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi takes drastic action against the sinful, they have nothing to fear, for He will arrange a better human form for them. He has clearly said,<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="1..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Paritra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;ya sa&#x301;dhu&#x301;na&#x301;m&#x301; means &ldquo;for the protection of the virtuous&rdquo;. First I will explain what the term sa&#x301;dhu really means. In popular Indian usage, sa&#x301;dhu means those persons who smear themselves with white ashes, keep locks of matted hair on their heads and wear white turbans and white clothes. The leader of a group of such sa&#x301;dhus is called a moha&#x301;nta. Those who may or may not use coloured ashes (white, red, crimson, etc.), who wear either red or saffron turbans and clothes and who suffix their names with a&#x301;nanda [bliss], are known as sannya&#x301;sins [renunciants]. Sa&#x301;dhus on the other hand usually use the word da&#x301;sa [servant] together with their first name, such as Sumera Da&#x301;sa, Jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na Da&#x301;sa, Ra&#x301;ma Da&#x301;sa, etc. Their Indian or international leader is known as maha&#x301;man&#x301;d&#x301;aleshvara, whereas the head of a small monastery in known as mat&#x301;ha&#x301;dhiisha. So these are the two broad classifications &ndash; sa&#x301;dhu and sannya&#x301;sii. This classification is based upon outward appearance, external criteria.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->What is the inner truth? The word sannya&#x301;sii is derived sat + nya&#x301;s + suffix nini, first case ending, singular number. Sannya&#x301;sii means one who, out of noble intentions and benevolent outlook, has sacrificed his or her everything for the highest goal in life, Parama Purus&#x301;a. The word sa&#x301;dhu can be interpreted in two ways, but in both cases the meaning is the same. The first interpretation is:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..11"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Ja&#x301;tasya hi jagati jantavah sa&#x301;dhujiivita&#x301;h;<br>Ye punarn&#x301;eha ja&#x301;yante shes&#x301;a&#x301;h jat&#x301;haragardabha&#x301;h.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..12"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->[The lives of those human beings who are sa&#x301;dhu (upright), and who are not born again, I call successful. The lives of the rest are no better than those of donkeys.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->It is a fact that not all human beings are righteous. Even though one possesses a human framework, one&#146;s demeanour, conduct and thought processes may be worse than those of an animal. Hence it is said that a person who has lived his or her life honestly, who has not harmed others to further his or her own interests, and has worked for the welfare of others in every way, is a sa&#x301;dhu. He or she is not required to be reborn on this earth. He or she becomes one with Parama Purus&#x301;a after death, and the separate identity is lost in Parama Purus&#x301;a. In the Bengali literature of 1200 years ago it is mentioned, Je je ujuba&#x301;t&#x301;e gela&#x301; ana&#x301;bat&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301; bhaela&#x301; soi. That is, &ldquo;One who has followed the straight path of the sus&#x301;umna&#x301; canal<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.1.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#1.fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> upwards does not return.&rdquo; He or she becomes one with Parama Purus&#x301;a, losing his or her separate existence. To come down to a lower level of consciousness, it is necessary to maintain a separate existence. Just because one has a human form and just because one besmears one&#146;s body with ashes, wears white and uses the name Da&#x301;sa, it does not mean that one is a sa&#x301;dhu. Shiva made a pointed comment regarding such people: &ldquo;Yes, these people no doubt have human bodies, but in their thoughts and behaviour they are not sa&#x301;dhu, not honest. Though I accept their mothers as humans, they themselves are donkeys, donkeys born out of human wombs.&rdquo; A true sa&#x301;dhu is a real spiritualist, a spiritually-evolved person.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->You may wonder why Shiva has used such strong language. Being as vehemently opposed to injustice as Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi was, Shiva was the prototype of Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi. When one has to speak or fight against injustice, or take administrative action against it, one must not betray any weakness. One must denounce it in the strongest language, because only strong words can strike the right chord in the heart of a sinful person. This is the proper interpretation of sa&#x301;dhu.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Yes, Shiva was very stern in this regard. Those who preach meaningless, irrational dogmas and thereby enormously harm society, who crudify the human intellect, who do not leave any scope to think of anything other than mundane problems, who throttle the very freedom of thought, Shiva called Lokavya&#x301;mohaka&#x301;rakah. That is, &ldquo;They infect society with a form of mental disease.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->The second interpretation of sa&#x301;dhu is:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..17"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Pra&#x301;na&#x301;h yatha&#x301;tmano&#146;bhiis&#x301;t&#x301;ah bhu&#x301;ta&#x301;na&#x301;m api te tatha&#x301;;<br>A&#x301;tmaopamyena bhuta&#x301;na&#x301;m&#x301; daya&#x301;m&#x301; kurvanti sa&#x301;dhavah.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..18"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;The life of every creature is as valuable to itself as one&#146;s own life is valuable to a human being: one who remembers this and shows kindness to all, is termed sa&#x301;dhu.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->These are the interpretations of sa&#x301;dhu.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi says, Paritra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;ya sa&#x301;dhu&#x301;na&#x301;m [&ldquo;for the protection of sa&#x301;dhus&rdquo;]. Some so-called moralists declare, &ldquo;I don&#146;t do any wrong, so I&#146;m a moralist. I do good to others, so I&#146;m surely a sa&#x301;dhu.&rdquo; To this I will reply that they are not sa&#x301;dhus. Only that person who lives in constant God-awareness deserves to be called a sa&#x301;dhu, a spirituo-moralist.  One who is not constantly absorbed in the thought of God cannot lead a moral life for any length of time &ndash; his or her morality may collapse at any moment. Perhaps one can resist the temptation to take a bribe of ten thousand rupees, but cannot resist the temptation of a million rupees. But not only will a person who is an ardent devotee of the Lord resist the temptation of a million rupees; if you offer that person the emperorship of the universe, the person will say, &ldquo;No, the total worth of all this is far, far less than that of the Lord. I am not prepared to accept all these worthless things in exchange for Parama Purus&#x301;a.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->You now understand that by merely smearing ashes on one&#146;s body one does not qualify to be a sa&#x301;dhu. In fact, one should keep such sa&#x301;dhus at arm&#146;s length, because if they cover their bodies with ashes to hide the filth deep within themselves, it means that a lot of such filth must have accumulated. One must be wary of them.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Tra&#x301;n&#x301;a means temporary relief from distress. Suppose there has been a great calamity such as a flood or famine which has inflicted immense suffering on the victims. The measures you take to alleviate the suffering of those in distress are called tra&#x301;n&#x301;a vyavastha&#x301; [relief activities]. For instance, you may visit an afflicted area and distribute ten thousand maunds [about forty thousand kilos] of flour among the people. You have done very commendable tra&#x301;n&#x301;a, but how long will that flour last? Ten or twenty years? No, your stock will be exhausted within a week and again the necessity to start a relief operations will arise. This is tra&#x301;n&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Paritra&#x301;n&#x301;a is the kind of tra&#x301;n&#x301;a whose beneficial effects continue to recur over an endless period of time.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a gave a permanent assurance to righteous people that He would protect them. He wanted to develop the way of life, the educational system and the economy of the society in such a way that all good people might find solutions for their mundane, supra-mundane and spiritual problems, and permanent relief from the three kinds of bondages [physical, mental and spiritual].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->Vina&#x301;sha&#x301;ya ca dus&#x301;krta&#x301;m means &ldquo;for the destruction of the wicked&rdquo;. Here &ldquo;destruction&rdquo; implies change of form. Change occurs, but this change is for the better: the previous form is replaced by a new one. Perhaps Ravana and Kansa were reborn as ideal devotees; their previous forms were replaced by better substitutes.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->Who are dus&#x301;krtas [the wicked]? Those who cause harm to innocent people either out of self-interest or group-interest are called dus&#x301;krtas. Such antisocial people are a burden on a civilized society, a black spot on society. For such people there is only deha&#x301;tmava&#x301;da and dehaparin&#x301;a&#x301;mava&#x301;da [materialistic doctrines of Charvaka philosophy].<!-- /block --></p>

It throws the cultural and spiritual values of life into the garbage and destroys the very future of humanity. This is gross materialism and those [[who]] support it, consciously or unconsciously, should be branded as dus&#x301;krtaka&#x301;riis.

<a name="1..42"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=42 type=paragraph -->What is the meaning of yuga [sandhi]? Between any two epochs there is a transitional period. For instance, in history there was the Elizabethan Age, there was the Victorian Age, etc. One epoch is followed by another, in the psychic world as well as in the physical world. Suppose a society is moving in a particular direction with a certain philosophy: suddenly it receives a jolt from somewhere and stops, not knowing which way to go. Confused, it begins moving again in another direction. The transitional point between the two flows is called yuga sandhi. And each one of the particular flows of a society is known as an &ldquo;epoch&rdquo; in English, yuga in Sanskrit. One particular epoch ends and a new one follows. One set of ideas and values ends and a new set begins. At the transitional point, human beings become confused: they lose the ability to discriminate between dharma and adharma, what they should and what they should not do. At that moment, the advent of a great personality becomes an imperative necessity. Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi came only to teach people what dharma is and what adharma is, what to do and what not to do, and which path would bring the highest fulfilment in their lives. He arrived at the right time, the transitional period in history; so He said, Sambhava&#x301;mi yuge yuge [&ldquo;I incarnate Myself from age to age&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>

So Maha&#x301;vis&#x301;n&#x301;u cannot be compared with Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi. Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi is the very symbol of infinite life-force. He wants to take all with Him. He is the nearest and dearest of all. No one is insignificant, no one is negligible. He belongs to one and all.

<a name="2..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Today I will say something about Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a in the light of dvaetava&#x301;da [dualism]. Before we begin to analyse the topic at some length, one should form a very clear idea of what dvaetava&#x301;da is. This analysis should cover the entire period of history, from the prehistoric dawn to the historic age, and should include the science of Sanskrit phonetics.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Language develops as a result of adjustment between mental vibrations and the external vibrations of the manifested world. Changes occur in the external conditions of the world, but mental vibrations do not undergo much change. Mind controls the external world to a great extent, and the external world controls the mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Take for example the colour red. The colour is there in the external world. It has a physical vibration contained within light rays. Those vibrations strike the eyes, and the mind vibrates and dances in accordance with those vibrations.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->All vibrations, all kinds of dance, produce sound. One sees the colour red in the external world. When that colour comes and strikes the eyes of a person of a particular area, of a particular natural environment, its vibration strikes the optical nerve, and thence the impact of the vibration falls on the ma&#x301;nasadeha [mental body]; and the mind then vibrates &ndash; but not only according to the ocular vibration, rather according to the sound vibration as well. When the mind dances on seeing the colour red, a sound vibration arises in the mind &ndash; t&#x301;ak, t&#x301;ak, t&#x301;ak, t&#x301;ak.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.2.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#2.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> That is why we say t&#x301;akt&#x301;ake la&#x301;l [scarlet red] in Bengali. Similarly, on seeing a white object, the mental sound vibration dhab, dhab, dhab occurs. Hence the Bengali expression dhabdhabe sa&#x301;da&#x301; [sparkling white].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->From that dhab sound, that acoustic expression of the inner mind, a root verb came into being in Sanskrit, and from that root dhava, with the addition of the verb la&#x301; and the suffix d&#x301;a, the word dhavala [white] was formed.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->In pure Hindi, dhavala has become dhaola&#x301;; in Bengali, dhala&#x301;; and in Oriya, dhar&#x301;a&#x301;. This is the way in which words are formed.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->When the mind moves in one direction, flowing towards a particular point, then the numerical concept regarding that point is termed eka [one]. Eka is common to all people, literate or illiterate, white or black. When all the ideas in the mind flow in a particular line and culminate at a particular point, then the numerical expression concerning that particular point is &ldquo;one&rdquo;. In the very ancient Sanskrit of the Vedic age a finger was also called eka; two fingers were called dvi [two]. In old Latin it is dui, in later Latin tui, from which the English word &ldquo;twin&rdquo; has come. In the Austric language group there was no such word as &ldquo;one&rdquo; or &ldquo;two&rdquo;. To demonstrate &ldquo;one&rdquo; they used to show one finger, and &ldquo;two&rdquo; would be two fingers; to indicate &ldquo;five&rdquo; they would show the whole hand. (The Persian equivalent of &ldquo;five&rdquo; is painj. The land where five rivers flow is &ldquo;Pain&#x32D;ja&#x301;b&rdquo; [Punjab]. The hand is called pain&#x32D;ja&#x301; because it has five fingers.) To demonstrate &ldquo;ten&rdquo; in the Austric languages the people used to show two hands; in the case of &ldquo;fifteen&rdquo;, two hands and a foot; and in the case of &ldquo;twenty&rdquo;, two hands and two feet. The ancient Austric word for the human body was kur, so the number represented by the human body possessing two hands and two feet became kuri, from which the modern Bengali word kur&#x301;i is derived. Even today in some systems of counting, &ldquo;twenty&rdquo; is the highest number. That is why people say ek kur&#x301;i [&ldquo;one twenty&rdquo;], du kur&#x301;i [&ldquo;two twenties&rdquo;], tin kur&#x301;i [&ldquo;three twenties&rdquo;], and so on, when bargaining in the market.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->In the primary stage of civilization, people were only a little conscious of themselves and totally unconscious about other things. Later, when language emerged, when old Sanskrit and old Latin were widespread, people began to understand more about their existence. They realized, &ldquo;I exist, and there must be a Creator, the Creator of all the things around me in the universe, who must also be watching me.&rdquo; These were the ideas that dawned upon the human mind. The primitive people thought, &ldquo;There exists one &lsquo;I&rsquo;, and there also exists one entity who is guiding all entities. So there are two&rdquo; &ndash; whether &ldquo;two fingers&rdquo; or dui or dvi or dua, etc. The notion that there are two entities was termed &ldquo;dualism&rdquo; in Latin, dvaetava&#x301;da in Sanskrit. There may or may not be more entities, but there are certainly two &ndash; I and my Lord. In the initial stage of philosophy only dualism existed. Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya philosophy, which I have already discussed, is also dualism, because it is based on the notion that there is one Prakrti and many purus&#x301;as. This is the main contention of Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya philosophy. So Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya is also dualism. But in this school Purus&#x301;a is not established in His full authority. It makes little difference whether He exists or not. But anyway, Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya was covered fairly well earlier.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Now let us see how the world is viewed in the light of dvaetava&#x301;da. All unit beings realize that they exist. This does not require much effort: even an illiterate person is aware that he or she exists. If you ask a rustic fellow, &ldquo;Hello, how are you?&rdquo; he will reply &ldquo;I am fine, thank you.&rdquo; That is, he knows that he exists. No one needs to be taught this. Everyone takes it for granted that they exist. If a great scholar of Vishuddha Advaetava&#x301;da attempts to explain to the same fellow that he does not exist, the rustic will most probably reply, &ldquo;What nonsense! You&#146;re talking to me and yet telling me that I don&#146;t exist? Then who are you talking to?&rdquo; Confusing ideas like this were propounded for many centuries. In the initial stage of philosophy people believed that there existed only the unit beings and their Lord. They could not understand the intricacies of philosophical queries. Philosophy had not yet come into being.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->As far as human history can say, Maharshi Kapila was the propounder of the world&#146;s first school of philosophy, Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya philosophy. As a result he was known as a&#x301;dividva&#x301;n [the first scholar]. The people of that age did not possess an intellect subtle enough to probe deeply into things. Thus it would not be proper to find fault with them or condemn them in harsh language. They simply started moving towards Parama Purus&#x301;a without possessing any philosophical knowledge about Him.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->The extent of their belief was that one Entity is the cause of the universe and the one overseeing its smooth unfoldment. Their inner feeling was, &ldquo;I must move towards the Master, the Supreme Cause, who remains behind the curtain directing the entire performance. Whether I understand more than this or not makes no difference.&rdquo; Dualistic philosophy is based on this inner understanding. No one has yet cared to analyse dualism in detail. The general tendency of dualism is to take it for granted that there are two entities, the devotee and the Lord.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->The &ldquo;Ra&#x301;dha&#x301;&rdquo; concept is recognized by dualistic philosophy also. Therein it is said that the existential point of one&#146;s jiiva bha&#x301;va [microcosmic bearing], that is, one&#146;s &ldquo;I&rdquo;-ness concentrated at a particular point, is Ra&#x301;dha&#x301; bha&#x301;va. And the main nucleus of the vast entity who is guiding the universe is also a point. This point (the Supreme Controlling Nucleus) is the Abhiis&#x301;t&#x301;a of the first point (the unit being), and the first point (the unit being) is the is&#x301;t&#x301;a of this point (the Supreme Controlling Nucleus). Is&#x301;t&#x301;a and Abhiis&#x301;t&#x301;a mean almost the same thing; abhi means &ldquo;all-pervasive&rdquo;, therefore the Abhiis&#x301;t&#x301;a is the all-pervasive Is&#x301;t&#x301;a [Goal].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..13"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Jale hari sthale Hari anale anile Hari<br>Graha-ta&#x301;ra&#x301;-su&#x301;rye Hari harimaya e trisam&#x301;sa&#x301;r.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..14"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->[Hari resides in both land and water. He is the wind and the fire. He exists in the stars, the planets and the sun. The three worlds are permeated by Him.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->When one conceives one&#146;s is&#x301;t&#x301;a in this way, it is then called one&#146;s A&#x301;bhiis&#x301;t&#x301;a. The microcosm, in the form of a point, moves towards the nuclear point of Parama Purus&#x301;a, with or without philosophical understanding of what it is doing. Where does this movement terminate? And what does it mean to say that the microcosm is a point? A point, as we know, has position but no magnitude. Unit beings have an individual existence or &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling. &ldquo;I am well-read, fabulously rich, and enjoy name, fame and prestige. I buy people with one hand and sell them with the other.&rdquo; This is how people brag and boast about themselves. But their vain words merely revolve around a point having position but no magnitude, just like the point at the end of a pencil. Parama Purus&#x301;a, however, is abhiis&#x301;t&#x301;a, all-pervasive, self-illuminating. Whatever we can imagine and whatever we cannot imagine is Parama Purus&#x301;a. But the universal nucleus which controls the omnipresence of Parama Purus&#x301;a is also a point having position but no magnitude.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->The jiiva bha&#x301;va, when reduced to a point, is called Ra&#x301;dha&#x301;. That is, Ra&#x301;dha&#x301; represents the existential feeling of the microcosm. The microcosmic nucleus moves towards the Macrocosmic Nucleus not through knowledge or action, but through devotion. So why do people bother to cultivate knowledge or action? They do so to make their devotion more intense, not for any other reason. People do not eat pickles to fill the stomach, but only to whet their appetite so that they can enjoy their food more. Similarly, devotees cultivate knowledge and action not for their physical growth, but to acquire more strength to move along the path of devotion with greater acceleration. This movement towards Parama Purus&#x301;a is devotion, and the attainment is also devotion.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->People advance towards Parama Purus&#x301;a by virtue of their devotion &ndash; the microcosmic point advances towards the nuclear point of Parama Purus&#x301;a. The closer it gets, the more it realizes the proximity of the Macrocosmic Nucleus and the more change occurs in the nature of the point. Suppose a drop of water is advancing towards the sun. The more it advances, the more it gets converted into vapour, and when it attains the closest proximity to the sun, it becomes simply a round ball of fire. Or still better to take the case of a piece of iron. When it is quite close to the sun it loses its solidity and is converted into molten iron. When it moves even closer, it changes from molten iron into vapourized iron, gaseous iron. And when it reaches its closest proximity to the sun it becomes one with the sun, turning into a round ball of fire. Its identity separate from the sun can no longer be found even if one beats one&#146;s head against the wall trying.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Thus in the process of movement the more the microcosmic point advances towards the Macrocosmic point, the more it imbibes the qualities of the Macrocosm. In the beginning the microcosmic point possess only microcosmic qualities. It is only a sa&#x301;dhaka, only a Ra&#x301;dha&#x301;. One who does a&#x301;ra&#x301;dhana&#x301; or constant Cosmic ideation is called &ldquo;Ra&#x301;dha&#x301;&rdquo;. The more a sa&#x301;dhaka advances, the more his or her qualities change. When in the process one comes into close proximity with the Macrocosmic nucleus,  one loses one&#146;s original qualities and acquires the qualities of the object of ideation. Ma&#x301;dhava Ma&#x301;dhava anukhana sunri Sundarii Ma&#x301;dhava bhelii [&ldquo;Ra&#x301;dhika&#x301; (Ra&#x301;dha&#x301;) while constantly remembering Ma&#x301;dhava (Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;) became Ma&#x301;dhava Himself&rdquo;]. Vidyapati says that while thinking of Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, Ra&#x301;dha&#x301; was so radically changed inwardly that her entire mind become transformed into Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. When the microcosmic point comes in close proximity to the Macrocosmic nucleus there can no longer remain two points &ndash; they merge into one. The jiiva merges with Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. Thus ultimately there can be no duality &ndash; it simply cannot survive.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->There are many who argue, &ldquo;I exist and my Lord also exists. I don&#146;t want to merge with my Lord, but prefer to remain near Him and enjoy His bliss.&rdquo; They say,<!-- /block --></p>

I will feel waves of joy on listening to stories about Him.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Dualists make a serious and dangerous mistake. If one remains close to Him for a long time, one&#146;s individual existence is bound to be lost &ndash; the unit being will become one with Parama Purus&#x301;a whether it likes it or not. When you have a strong desire to eat sugar, your mind becomes associated with the sugar. You are so determined to enjoy the sweet taste that if someone speaks to you, you do not reply. You are not even concerned about the colour of the sugar: your mind is focused only on eating it. As all your psychic energy and psychic propensities rush towards a single entity, you succeed in tasting it. Even then, two entities are present &ndash; yourself and the taste of sugar. But when you swallow it there are no longer two entities &ndash; the two become one. Similarly, when one moves towards Parama Purus&#x301;a, accepting Him as one&#146;s sugar, one loses one&#146;s existence and becomes one with Him.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->1 + 1 = 2. This is the first stage. 1 + 1 = 1. This is the second stage. 1 + 1 = &ldquo;What? I do not know.&rdquo; This is the final stage.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->Some devotees are dualists out of ignorance and say, &ldquo;O Lord, You are sandalwood and I am water.&rdquo; (Unless sandalwood is put into water it does not give off a strong scent.) It is a wonderful image. The jiiva bha&#x301;va is concentrated in the mu&#x301;la&#x301;dha&#x301;ra cakra, and Shiva or Parama Purus&#x301;a resides in the controlling point of the pineal gland. Now if we compare Parama Purus&#x301;a to a condensed form of sandalwood paste and the jiiva bha&#x301;va at the mu&#x301;la&#x301;dha&#x301;ra cakra to water, then the more the water flows towards the sandalwood through the sus&#x301;umna&#x301; canal, the more it imbibes the qualities of the sandalwood, thereby losing its original characteristics. When in this process it reaches the controlling point of the pineal gland it completely loses its original characteristics and assumes those of the sandalwood. Then there remains only one entity: the sandalwood. The water is absorbed into the sandalwood and lost forever. When, in the process of making itself more pure and holy than the sandalwood, it comes close to the sandalwood, first you will see that it will become like the sandalwood. Then, when it comes still closer, you will see that it has become simply sandalwood. Then you will see that it and the sandalwood have become one. Similarly, when the jiiva bha&#x301;va approaches close to the Lord, it is no longer &ldquo;You exist, O Lord, and I also exist,&rdquo; but &ldquo;You exist, O Lord, only You exist.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->Thus in the final stage of spiritual elevation dualism cannot survive. Even if someone says that he or she loves to eat sugar, still dualism cannot survive. That is why one should never think, &ldquo;Parama Purus&#x301;a is so vast and I am only an ordinary human being.&rdquo; This is almost blasphemy. A drop of water in the ocean is small, no doubt, but it resides within the depths of the mighty ocean. Similarly, a human being may be but an ordinary mortal, but he or she has the capacity to become one with Parama Purus&#x301;a. When one draws close to Parama Purus&#x301;a, one merges in Him whether one likes it or not.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a is that sort of nucleus, attracting all to Himself. He casts a loving smile at His devotees and says, &ldquo;Come to Me, don&#146;t stay away. Why are you hiding? Come, come to Me.&rdquo; The more jiivas advance towards Him, the more they feel the greatness of Parama Purus&#x301;a, and the more their lives and minds become enveloped by His greatness. When sa&#x301;dhakas reach the saha&#x301;sra&#x301;ra cakra, this close association is converted into absorption, and they are no longer able to maintain their separate existence. In this universe Parama Purus&#x301;a is one, not two. When the jiivas come to Him they cannot remain many, but become one. That is why those who are true devotees, the genuine yogis, the real practitioners of yoga, are bound in love and fellowship to one another.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->I also trust and believe that whatever Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi wanted to do and whatever Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a desired, sa&#x301;dhakas will certainly accomplish in close collaboration with Him. You will bring about a radical change in the social order so that each individual can find ample scope for physical, mental and spiritual evolution. Remove the sorrow and suffering of exploited humanity; wipe the tears from their eyes. Build an ideal human society based on dharma. Let this be the sole mission of your life.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="3..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Now let us analyse whether the actions and observations of Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a the king, have any relation to dvaetava&#x301;da. In my previous discourse I thoroughly analysed the concept of dvaetava&#x301;da. Generally there are three ways to ascertain the views of great personalities: first, by what they said; secondly, by what they did, even though they may not have said anything; and thirdly, even though they may not have said or done anything, by what they did not say &ndash; one way or the other &ndash; on a particular issue. In analysing Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a in the light of the dvaetava&#x301;da, we should first find out what he has said in this regard. He once said:<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="3..3"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->[Set aside all other dharmas and take shelter in Me alone; I will save you from all sin, have no fear about that.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->According to Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi, the highest dharma in human life is to take shelter in the Supreme. In Sanskrit there are many near synonyms for the verb cal (to move): car, at&#x301;, vraja, etc. Calati means &ldquo;to move in a natural way&rdquo;; carati means &ldquo;to move while eating&rdquo;; at&#x301;ati means &ldquo;to travel while learning something&rdquo; (paryat&#x301;aka, derived from the prefix pari + the root verb at&#x301;, means &ldquo;a world traveller who moves from place to place in search of knowledge&rdquo;). The verb vrajati means &ldquo;to move while enjoying spiritual bliss&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Here Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi says Sarvadharma&#x301;n parityajya [&ldquo;Set aside all other dharmas&rdquo;]. What is the meaning of dharma? It means &ldquo;property&rdquo; or &ldquo;characteristic&rdquo;. Jiivas maintain their existence through the expression of their inner characteristics in different spheres of creation. Every object in the universe has its own inherent characteristic: the characteristic of water is to make things wet, and that of fire is to burn. Centring around this fundamental characteristic, there are many secondary characteristics. For example, fire burns, but it does not burn the entirety of an object in the same way. It may burn one part of an object thoroughly and another part only partially. These different stages of burning are the secondary characteristics of the primary characteristic of fire, to burn. Water also has a number of secondary characteristics, and the collection of all these secondary characteristics is known as its dharma. To illustrate, when people eat, they do not mix all their food together and gulp it down voraciously, but follow a system of eating. For example, they may first eat bitter items, then semi-bitter ones, then sour ones, and finally sweet things. Sweets come at the end. The entire action of taking different items of food is called eating.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->All dharmas have upadharmas [secondary characteristics]. Human life is no exception. For example, to provide for your family you require some sort of employment &ndash; be it agriculture, trading or business &ndash; you have to keep the house clean, feed everyone, and so on. These are the secondary characteristics included within the fundamental human dharma. What normally happens in human life? People get caught up in the secondary characteristics. For instance, when eating delicious food people often say &ldquo;How good it tastes! But if it only had a bit more spice in it, then it would taste even better.&rdquo; Being engrossed in the secondary dharma, people all too easily deviate from their main dharma. In ancient India, the usual custom was to offer a part of one&#146;s meal to God before eating it. The spirit was, &ldquo;May I remember You with every bit of food.&rdquo; In Ananda Marga there is a system of applying guru mantra before commencing any action. The psycho-philosophy behind guru mantra is to transform the secondary dharma into the primary dharma at the psychic level. If this were not done then one&#146;s secondary dharma would predominate. Much precious time is wasted by those who follow their secondary dharmas.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a exhorted the people unambiguously: &ldquo;Give up secondary dharmas and accept Me as your supreme goal. Do not let your mind be diverted to those countless secondary dharmas, but concentrate it on the fundamental primary dharma. Only then will every moment of your life be properly utilized.&rdquo; Now, what is this primary dharma? Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi declared, Ma&#x301;mekam&#x301; sharan&#x301;am&#x301; vraja [&ldquo;take shelter in Me alone&rdquo;]. Earlier I said that vraja means to move with Cosmic ideation in a state of bliss.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->The movement of human beings in this universe is not movement for movement&#146;s sake, but is comparable to a vraja parikrama&#x301; [joyous pilgrimage]. No one moves even one step without any purpose. What does vraja parikrama&#x301; signify? We all know that just as the historical Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a lived in the Vrindavana of this world, our spiritual Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a lives in the Vrindavana of our heart. He is the nucleus around which individuals move. That is why Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi says Ma&#x301;mekam&#x301; sharan&#x301;am&#x301; vraja. Do not run after name, power, position or wealth. Try to become one with Parama Purus&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->I have already said that when the jiiva tattva or Ra&#x301;dha&#x301; tattva comes within Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s closest proximity, two separate entities cannot remain &ndash; they will fuse and become one. Then what is the meaning of ekam [one]? When all the propensities of your psychic body coincide at one point, then those pointed propensities are called ekam. Whenever we talk of something in terms of ekam it implies that all propensities have become one-pointed. &ldquo;1&rdquo; is a numeral &ndash; the first, the greatest and the smallest numeral. It is the smallest because there is no numeral smaller than &ldquo;1&rdquo;. The only thing smaller than one is zero, but that is something which has no existence. And it is the greatest numeral, because when One is accepted as the goal of life, it becomes the most significant numeral for all human existence. In the absence of primary dharma, all secondary dharmas such as eating, drinking, walking and talking are meaningless &ndash; they have no real existence. Similarly, a zero without a preceding digit has no value. But when &ldquo;1&rdquo; precedes zero the latter acquires some significance. When zero joins with &ldquo;1&rdquo; it becomes ten. In the same way, when you first follow your fundamental dharma and then carry out your worldly duties, upadharmas, accordingly life carries some value. If the main dharma, that is, the supreme One, is forgotten, then no amount of worldly duty can make one&#146;s life glorious. When One (1) is absent, then the addition of any number of zeros carries no value.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..10"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Ra&#x301;m na&#x301;m ek aunk hya&#x301;y, sab sa&#x301;dhan hya&#x301;y shunya;<br>Aunk vina&#x301; kuch ha&#x301;t nahi aunk rahe dash gun&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->In the couplet the name of Rama is symbolized by the number one and the microcosmic endeavour is symbolized by zero.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->So when we add a zero to &ldquo;1&rdquo;, the value is increased ten times, although zero has no value of its own; it only acquires a certain value when it exists beside the numeral &ldquo;1&rdquo;. Therefore Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi says, Ma&#x301;mekam&#x301; sharan&#x301;am&#x301; vraja &ndash; &ldquo;Know Me as the Supreme One and seek shelter in Me.&rdquo; When the microcosmic point merges with the Macrocosmic point, then two entities no longer exist &ndash; there is only one entity. From Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi&#146;s statement we understand that He is not a dualist in essence. He wants to accept all as His own, to absorb all in Himself.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Why does he say vraja and not cala or gaccha [near synonyms]? Because when you move towards Parama Purus&#x301;a, you move in joy. As this movement of yours is a blissful one, it is called vraja parikrama&#x301;. &ldquo;When you are totally absorbed in the Supreme while discharging your worldly duties, you will surely come to Me. When your life revolves around the Supreme, your every action will shine with divine effulgence.&rdquo; Thus said Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a to His disciples.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->The second part of Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi&#146;s statement, aham&#x301; tva&#x301;m&#x301; sarvapa&#x301;pebhyo moks&#x301;ayis&#x301;ya&#x301;mi ma&#x301;shucah [&ldquo;I will save you from all sin, have no fear about that&rdquo;], is much clearer and more direct. How should we distinguish between pun&#x301;ya [virtue] and pa&#x301;pa [vice]? Pa&#x301;pa has been used in the Sanskrit shloka. Pa&#x301;pa means &ldquo;to do that which should not be done&rdquo;. For instance, stealing is pa&#x301;pa, telling lies is pa&#x301;pa. In addition to pa&#x301;pa, there is another word &ndash; pratyava&#x301;ya. Pratyava&#x301;ya means &ldquo;not to do what should be done&rdquo;. For instance, parents should educate their children. If they do not, they are said to have committed pratyava&#x301;ya. In some countries, parents are responsible for arranging the marriage of their daughters who are of suitable age . If they do not, they are said to have committed pratyava&#x301;ya. In common parlance, pa&#x301;pa means both pa&#x301;pa and pratyava&#x301;ya. The common word pa&#x301;taka [sin] thus has two branches &ndash; pa&#x301;pa and pratyava&#x301;ya.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->We should remember one more thing here. Microcosms, as they move through various kinds of physical and psycho-physical clash on the path of pratisain&#x32D;cara, are assailed by pa&#x301;pa and pratyava&#x301;ya. This leaves an imprint on their minds. This imprint is not the mind&#146;s true nature but merely an external covering. If one chews betel, then one&#146;s lips become reddish temporarily, but when washes one&#146;s lips afterwards the red colour disappears. Similarly, when human beings fall into pa&#x301;pa or pratyava&#x301;ya through their bad actions or their inaction, an impression is left upon their minds. But later, when they draw close to Parama Purus&#x301;a by virtue of spiritual sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, that impression of pa&#x301;pa or pratyava&#x301;ya disappears.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Some people think that since they have become so sinful, there is no hope for them in the future. A great devotee of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, Subuddhi Roy, thought that he had committed many sins in his life. He thought that the only way to atone for his sins was to commit suicide by throwing himself in the Ganges. Mahaprabhu caught his arms and pulled him out, saying, &ldquo;No, no, no &ndash; why should you commit a sin like this?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..17"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Prabhu kay iha&#x301; haete ya&#x301;ha Vrinda&#x301;van;<br>Nirantara Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a na&#x301;m kara sam&#x301;kiirtana.<br>Ek na&#x301;ma&#x301;veshe toma&#x301;r pa&#x301;p du&#x301;re ya&#x301;be;<br>A&#x301;r na&#x301;m laete Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a-ca&#x301;ran&#x301; pa&#x301;ibe.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..18"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->[Instead of committing suicide go to Vrindavana and do the sam&#x301;kiirtana of Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a unceasingly. By uttering the name of the Lord even once you will be purged of your sins, and when you repeat His name you will attain His holy feet.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->Subuddhi Roy asked, &ldquo;Where is the road to Vrindavana? Alas, I am too great a sinner. How can I go to Vrindavana?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Mahaprabhu replied, &ldquo;Vrindavana is in your mind. Go deep into your mind.&rdquo; Even though the jiiva&#x301;tma&#x301; may be assailed by bad deeds, its original nature is never distorted; it only gets a little soiled, a bit covered. In that state the jiiva&#x301;tma&#x301; is called pa&#x301;popahata caetanya [consciousness assailed by sin]. And when influenced by good deeds, it is called pun&#x301;yopahata caetanya [consciousness affected by virtue]. Actually the words pa&#x301;pa&#x301;tma&#x301; and pun&#x301;ya&#x301;tma&#x301; [soul affected by sin or by virtue] are both incorrect. The soul never commits a sin, it never becomes sinful, nor does it ever become virtuous. It remains deathless and undecaying in its original state. But it does receive an impression.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->What is this impression like? Suppose you place a large red rose in front of a clear mirror. If you look at the mirror, what do you see? A red rose. From a distance, one may say that the mirror is red, but is it actually so? No, the mirror is not red, but only appears to be red, coloured by the reflection of the red rose. In the same way, the human soul is also apparently coloured by virtue or vice. Whenever the soul comes in contact with any action, any psychic thought-wave, or any mental feeling, it is apparently affected, but not actually affected, just as the mirror is not actually coloured red. This is how this pa&#x301;popahata caetanya and pun&#x301;yopahata caetanya are created, due to the effect of sinful or virtuous deeds and thoughts.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->When jiivas approach Parama Purus&#x301;a (Sarvadharma&#x301;n parityajya Ma&#x301;mekam&#x301; sharan&#x301;am&#x301; vraja), the impressions caused by their good or bad thoughts and actions become more distinct and are gradually expelled from the mind. The colours of worldly deeds, good or bad, cannot affect Parama Purus&#x301;a. In Parama Purus&#x301;a&#146;s proximity there remains only His reflection. When reflected images, merge into the original substance the images cease to exist. Likewise, when the reflected images of jiiva&#x301;tma&#x301;s merge with Parama Purus&#x301;a, there remains only one, only Parama Purus&#x301;a. That is why He says, &ldquo;Accept Me alone, not My reflections, and I will liberate you from all sins. Do not worry.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Ma&#x301;shuca &ndash; &ldquo;Do not worry in the least. I am here for you. I will do everything for you. Only come to Me.&rdquo; This is not the statement of a dvaetava&#x301;di [dualist]. It is the statement of an advaetava&#x301;di [non-dualist] who admits the relative existence of the jiivas in the initial stage, and in the final stage assimilates them into His vast Cosmic body. This great assurance given by Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi to the jiivas is invaluable: something beyond human description. Herein lies the greatest charm, the greatest attraction, of the personality of Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi. It is totally pointless to analyse Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi in the light of dvaetava&#x301;da. He was never a dvaetava&#x301;dii.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="4..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->In dvaeta&#x301;dvaetava&#x301;da (dualistic non-dualism) first there is dvaeta and then there is advaeta. (The words are conjoined according to the principle of supsupeti sama&#x301;sa in Sanskrit grammar.) That is, what was dualism in the initial stage is transformed into non-dualism at a later stage. This being so, I will discuss how Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;as activities and behaviour are consistent with or different from dvaeta&#x301;dvaetava&#x301;da. Because in this regard, what He did in the practical field is far more significant than what He said.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->According to dvaeta&#x301;dvaetava&#x301;da, in the initial stage jiivas are different from Parama Purus&#x301;a, thinking themselves to be separate entities (and in fact they are); but in the final stage, by virtue of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, the irresistible attraction of the Great, and the unconditional grace of Parama Purus&#x301;a, they come into close proximity with Parama Purus&#x301;a and become one with Him. In the beginning they were two, but in the end they become one. When sugar and sand are mixed together they still maintain their separate identities; they are said to be united but not unified. But when sugar and water are mixed together they become syrup, thus losing their separate identities. In this case they have not been united but unified: two entities have been fused into one. In dvaeta&#x301;dvaetava&#x301;da, the jiiva and Parama Purus&#x301;a become one after unification.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Some people may raise the question whether this unification is like that of sugar and sand or like that of sugar and water. It is a pertinent question, and although a complicated one philosophically, can be answered in a simple way. The original propounders of this doctrine did not advance any easy analogy like the one of sugar and water and sugar and sand. Had they done so it would have landed them in great difficulty.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->There is a certain doctrine which contends that the merger of jiiva and Parama Purus&#x301;a is like a mixture of sugar and sand; for they become one but not exactly the same. This sort of philosophical doctrine is known as acintya bheda&#x301;bhedava&#x301;da. According to its propounders, it is beyond human comprehension to know what sort of unification takes place. Other doctrines claim that the two become completely unified just like sugar and water. We can call these two analogies as sharkara&#x301;-ba&#x301;luka [sugar and sand] and sharkara&#x301;-jalam [sugar and water]. Sometimes very complex ideas can be easily understood with the help of simple analogies.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The concept of Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a involves the question of dualism in the beginning and non-dualism in the end. Is merger in Him like sugar and sand or like sugar and water? Actually, before asking this question a much more significant question should be asked: if jiivas are dualists in the beginning and non-dualists in the end, where did they originate from? Some people say that Parama Purus&#x301;a picked up a handful of dust and scattered it around, and thus the world was created. I am not at all persuaded by this simplistic metaphysical proposition. My question to them is: Where did Parama Purus&#x301;a acquire that handful of dust? In dvaeta&#x301;dvaetava&#x301;da the question of the jiivas&#146; origin remains unanswered. This is one of its basic flaws.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Na&#x301;sato vidyate bha&#x301;vo na&#x301;bha&#x301;vo vidyate satah &ndash; &ldquo;Something cannot come out of nothing. Again, something or other comes out of something: that is, something comes out of something and nothing comes out of nothing.&rdquo; The jiiva is an entity and, as I have said earlier, an entity whose existence cannot be altogether denied. No matter how much we deny the existence of the world, we cannot make it non-existent. Jagadapi satyam a&#x301;peks&#x301;ikam &ndash; &ldquo;The world is a relative truth,&rdquo; and thus your physical body which exists in this relative world is also a relative truth. To exist in this relative world one requires food, clothing, shelter, education, medical treatment and other necessities of life. One cannot completely ignore these basic necessities. Ironically, those exponents of philosophy who have declared that this world is mere illusion or Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; have constructed various temples and monasteries in different parts of India. If the world is nothing but Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; then where is the necessity of all these temples and monasteries? There are clear contradictions between what such people preach and what they practise. Intelligent people, honest people, would never say anything self-contradictory. So the fundamental mistake of dvaeta&#x301;dvaetava&#x301;da is that it is mysteriously silent about the origin of the jiivas. Ramprasad, a famous mystic poet of Bengal, has given a beautiful answer to this question.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..7"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Prasa&#x301;d bale &ndash; ya&#x301; chili bha&#x301;i ta&#x301;i habi re nidenka&#x301;le;<br>Yeman jaler vimba jalei uday, jal haye se misha&#x301;y jale.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..8"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->[Prasad says that you will be the same in the end as you were in the beginning. Just as a water bubble arises from water and the next moment dissolves back into the water, similarly the jiiva comes out of Parama Purus&#x301;a and ultimately returns to Parama Purus&#x301;a.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->This is a deep philosophical idea expressed in very simple and lucid language. It is interesting to note that although the propounders of dvaeta&#x301;dvaetava&#x301;da do not mention where the jiivas come from, they do inform us that they merge into Parama Purus&#x301;a. I cannot understand why they avoid the question of the origin of the jiivas. I am in favour of saying things in clear, concise and conclusive terms. Frankly speaking, I dislike this sort of hush-hush mentality. It implies that there are some defects somewhere.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->One thing more has to be said in this regard. Although the jiivas are apparently small entities, they are part of the Infinite and as such have an element of infinity within. Their expressions and movements are not strictly limited to their physical existence. Regarding the divine nature of the jiivas, Rabindranath Tagore has said in one of his poems:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..11"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->A&#x301;mi ye ru&#x301;per padme karechi aru&#x301;p madhu pa&#x301;n,<br>Duhkher vaks&#x301;er ma&#x301;jhe a&#x301;nander peyechi sandha&#x301;n.<br>Ananta maner va&#x301;n&#x301;ii shunechi antare<br>Dekhechi jyotir path shu&#x301;nyamay a&#x301;ndhar&#x301; pra&#x301;ntare,<br>Nahi a&#x301;mi vidhir brhat pariha&#x301;s<br>Asiim aeshvarya diye racita mahat sarvana&#x301;sh.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..12"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->[From the lotus of beauteous forms I have drunk the nectar of<br>the formless,<br>In the depths of misery I have discovered infinite bliss.<br>I have listened to the message of the infinite silence,<br>I have seen the path of effulgence in the dark endless void.<br>Although a mere microcosm I am not just a joke of Providence<br>Surrounded by limitless Macrocosmic wealth, yet ending in the<br>Great Annihilation.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->It is not proper to remain silent about the source of this endless microcosmic expression. Neither is it proper to remain ambiguous about the jiivas&#146; final destination. One cannot escape these realities by resorting to philosophical rigmarole. It would be a great blunder to underestimate the immense potential lying latent within the jiivas.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->I have already said that to say that all jiivas have come out of nothing is incorrect, as something cannot come out of nothing, nor indeed can nothing come out of something. Something which exists will continue to exist, though undergoing metamorphosis. Similarly, that which  does not really exist can never have an expression. All of you feel that you are carrying some life-force in you, the warmth of life. You feel that you have a mind, and so many feelings and sentiments, hopes and aspirations, pains and pleasures &ndash; so many susceptibilities and sensibilities. If someone denies this, will you accept it? Certainly not. These are not burdens, but the bliss of joyful living. You are voluntarily carrying these burdens because they give you joy. It is a major point and it is left unanswered in dvaeta&#x301;dvaetava&#x301;da. The value of humanity goes unrecognized in this philosophy.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Next comes the question of advaeta. Advaeta is the logical conclusion of dvaeta. The entity which has been flowing from the infinite void to the infinite void can never terminate in a state of crudity. It is bound to merge in Parama Purus&#x301;a, the embodiment of bliss &ndash; there can be no other imaginable destination. Thus the jiiva and Shiva cannot maintain their separate existences, as sugar and sand do, but will become unified like sugar and water. An ordinary jiiva can become extraordinary by virtue of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, karma [selfless action], intellect and benevolence. When such highly-evolved individuals merge with Parama Purus&#x301;a, they render the Macrocosmic existence even more meaningful and significant. A small drop of the essence of the screw-pine flower can add scent to a hundred drops of water. The absorption of these evolved jiivas into Parama Purus&#x301;a adds to the charm of Parama Purus&#x301;a. Thus the unification of the jiiva with Parama Purus&#x301;a is not like that of sugar and sand, but sugar and water.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Now, let us analyse the life and personality of Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a in His infancy. Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a was born in Kansa&#146;s prison on a night shaken with heavy rains and fearsome thunderclaps, signifying the providential decree that the forces of wickedness represented by Kansa would be struck down. It was a part of the divine strategy to eliminate the tyrannical Kansa. How else could one account for the fact that one of Kansa&#146;s intelligence agents opened the jail gates? And that the people of Gokula fell asleep, thus facilitating the safe escape of the baby Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a? At least some people should have remained awake &ndash; but in that case, the historic exchange of children would not have taken place.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->These small incidents in the life of Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a are the precursors of a major event that was yet to come. Why did the child Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a kill Putana? She was a member of the intelligence department. Female employees of the intelligence branch were called vis&#x301;a kanya&#x301;<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.4.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#4.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> because they were required to carry a ring containing a small amount of poison. If caught by the enemy, they were supposed to commit suicide, as there was a strong possibility that they might divulge many secrets under torture. Putana was one such female intelligence agent employed by Kansa, king of Mathura. Vakasura and Aghasura were both gahapurus&#x301;as, male agents. Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a had no intention to go to Vakasura and Aghasura  and kill them; His humanitarian feelings forbade this.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Putana had only become Kansa&#146;s intelligence agent as a means of livelihood. She certainly did not adopt this profession out of love for Kansa! Aghasura and Vakasura as well had only adopted this profession as a means of livelihood. Rulers change as do the allegiances of the intelligence people. People who had sung songs of praise for one king could be later found criticizing the same king and eulogizing the new one. Obviously they had no ideology of their own. Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a did not plan to go to them and kill them, but He was obliged to strike back in self-defense when they made an attempt on His life.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->He could easily have killed Pu&#x301;tana&#x301; Ra&#x301;ks&#x301;asii<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.4.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#4.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> with his dagger or strangled her, but He did not. Putana attempted to suckle Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a after applying poison to her breast, but Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a bit her breast sharply, and the poison got into her bloodstream, and she died. Even while killing her, Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a showed great human consideration. Killing her was a last resort &ndash; had he sucked milk from her breast, He would have swallowed the poison, so He bit her instead in self-defense. Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a showed equal consideration before killing Vakasura and Aghasura. All these events in Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s life indicate that He was a great humanist. They also show that in the initial stage He recognized dvaetava&#x301;da to some extent.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.4.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#4.fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> <!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Jiivas emerge from Parama Purus&#x301;a, and eventually return to His supreme beatific stance. Putana, Vakasura and Aghasura also emerged from Parama Purus&#x301;a in the same way. They were also dvaeta jiivas [dualistic beings]. Had they [as dualistic beings] practised sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, they would certainly have merged with Parama Purus&#x301;a, but instead they took a different path, the negative path &ndash; they wanted to destroy the very nucleus of the universe, Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, the greatest treasure of humanity. Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a had to kill them as a last resort. He did not kill them for the sake of killing, but to counteract their evil tendency to destroy human solidarity. He was a fiery personality of human civilization, of human society. If people move too close to a fire without wearing adequate protection, they burn to ashes. That was the fate of those three. Had He looked upon them as mere dualistic beings, from a dualistic perspective, then He would have kept them away, but that He did not do. He did not want to treat any human being as a mere dualist would have.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->At a later stage of Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s life, we notice that His devotees were not well-versed in classical lore, did not have a deep knowledge of Sanskrit, and did not possess high academic qualifications. However, they had one rare quality &ndash; their dvaeta satta&#x301; [dualistic existence], the dualism that originates from Parama Purus&#x301;a. After coming in contact with Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a they started to move towards advaeta; they were moving towards oneness with Him. Let us see whether their merger with Him was like a mixture of sugar and sand or sugar and water.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->What does practical experience suggest? Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a had identified Himself with them to such an extent that it was almost impossible to distinguish Him from them. Yet He was the nucleus, the central figure, the fiery personality, the kaosthubhaman&#x301;i [the jewel of jewels], having its place of honour at the centre of the ornament. How does this spirit of dualism survive? It survives as long as there remains more than one mental object. If you take the entire universe as your object and not any finite mundane thing, you will become one with Parama Purus&#x301;a in that very instant. However, if you accept something small as your object, then individuality asserts itself and you feel that you are Tom, Dick or Harry. It is due to mental objects that bondage occurs in the human mind, and it these bondages which create the feeling of dualism and keep the individual separated from Parama Purus&#x301;a. Mental objects vary from person to person &ndash; one&#146;s mental object may be very expansive, leading him or her towards Parama Purus&#x301;a; another&#146;s may be very limiting, taking him or her away from Parama Purus&#x301;a. The person whose mental object is so vast that he or she says, &ldquo;O Parama Purus&#x301;a, only You exist. You are my everything; I have nothing of my own,&rdquo; attains oneness with Him.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Any object which creates bondage in the mind has its own particular colour. In those early days people used silver coins. While thinking of those silver coins, their minds would be coloured silver. Today, people&#146;s minds are coloured by the thought of paper currency. When someone thinks of an iron safe, one&#146;s mental object becomes the iron safe. When someone goes to the bank to deposit money, the bank&#146;s signboard becomes his or her mental object. Suppose a person has a hundred thousand rupees of black money and thinks, &ldquo;What shall I do with this black money? I know, I&#146;ll bury it for some time and then invest it in a business.&rdquo; All such things become a person&#146;s mental objects, one by one. The mind always takes something as its object, each object having its specific colour. The significance of the Dol Liila&#x301;, the Spring Festival, is to surrender all one&#146;s mental colour to Parama Purus&#x301;a, and thus free oneself from the bondage of colour.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a gave due recognition to this process, saying, &ldquo;Give your mental colours to Me and become one with Me.&rdquo; What does this mean? Does this merger resemble a mixture of sugar and sand or of sugar and water? Certainly, it was like a mixture of sugar and water. Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a demonstrated in His personal life that if one takes a dualistic attitude and enormously harms the collective interest, something has to be done to counteract it. Annihilation is not the goal here, but to extract the poison from the snake&#146;s fangs. Moreover it is a fact that no matter how sinful or wicked one might be, if one surrenders one&#146;s mental colour, be it black, yellow, red, etc., to Parama Purus&#x301;a by saying Tava dravyam&#x301; Govinda Tubhyameva samarpaye, Parama Purus&#x301;a immediately accepts the offering. At this point one becomes free from the bondage of colour and merges in one&#146;s true self. This is the highest stage of advaeta.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->People find it difficult to correlate the thoughts and actions of Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a with the dualistic portion of dvaeta&#x301;dvaetava&#x301;da. Jiivas have come out of the Supreme Cognitive Faculty. That Cognitive Faculty is none other than Parama Purus&#x301;a or Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, for Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a is none other than Ta&#x301;raka Brahma Himself. He makes it abundantly clear that in the final stage of unification, existence becomes as sweet as sugar and water, not unpleasant or distasteful like a mixture of sugar and sand. Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a did not want to see an unhappy ending such as that. Thus in analysing Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a in the light of dvaeta&#x301;dvaetava&#x301;da philosophy, we can say that Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a did not want things to turn out like that.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="5..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi can be analysed from two points of view &ndash; the point of view of what He said, and the point of view of what He did. What He said is mentioned in the Giita&#x301;. Here I shall analyse what He did. Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi gathered around Him a good number of righteous people, and together they strove tirelessly to promote human welfare.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The fundamental idea of dvaeta&#x301;dvaetava&#x301;da philosophy is that in the beginning there are two entities, while in the end there is only one. Initially the presence of two entities is admitted &ndash;  Jiiva ca tasya Iishvara, &ldquo;the sa&#x301;dhaka and the Supreme Object of his or her ideation&rdquo;. The duality of jiiva and Iishvara ends when the sa&#x301;dhaka and his or her object of ideation become one, when the devotee and the Lord are fused into one. I have already mentioned this many times.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Sa&#x301;dhakas move towards the goal &ndash; the Supreme Entity &ndash; along a difficult path strewn with thorns. Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; means to carry on an endless fight against the opposing forces and ideas that thwart the spiritual progress of an individual. When sa&#x301;dhakas succeed in removing all obstacles in this process of fight they (the devotees) and the Lord finally become one. This is the spiritual path, the path of spiritual progress.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Some devotees employ all their energy to impatiently entreat Parama Purus&#x301;a, &ldquo;O Lord, be gracious. Come to me.&rdquo; Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; implies that the devotees move towards their Lord. It may also happen that devotees address Parama Purus&#x301;a with all their psychic feeling concentrated on one point while sitting in one place. In this way, too, they can become one with the Lord. In order to become established in the state of non-dualism, devotees must practise sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. Devotees draw Parama Purus&#x301;a towards themselves with all their sincerity, emotion and sentiment focused on Him. This way of drawing Parama Purus&#x301;a to oneself is known as bhakti ma&#x301;rga [the path of devotion].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Kiirtana<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.5.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#5.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> is an integral part of bhakti ma&#x301;rga. During kiirtana devotees entreat Him, &ldquo;Come, O Lord, come to me. Come and sit amongst us, your devotees. We will love You and sing kiirtana for You; we will adore You with all the warmth of our hearts.&rdquo; This is the philosophical side of devotion. But the fundamental point is that the devotee will have to merge in the Lord. Initially it is dvaeta, because in the beginning there are two entities, the devotee and the Lord, but ultimately, when they become one, it is advaeta. That is why it is called dvaeta&#x301;dvaetava&#x301;da. As long as the devotees remain in the darkness of ignorance there is duality, but when their existence becomes illumined by the effulgence of divine knowledge by virtue of karma sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; and bhakti sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, they are said to be in the state of non-dualism.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a demonstrated in His own life how to become a righteous person. One must not retreat. Sometimes, as a matter of strategy, one may have to take two or three steps backwards, but in the end it may be as good as taking a hundred steps forward.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Let us take an example. Jarasandha, the king of Magadha, repeatedly attacked Mathura. To protect Mathura from his furious assaults, the capital was moved to Dwaraka. To reach Dwaraka one had to pass through the desert, and that was not possible for Jara&#x301;sandha. In this case, Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a adopted the policy of strategic retreat, but in fact He was taking a hundred steps forward. It was the best way to counteract the antisocial forces of Jarasandha.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->This is how Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi demonstrated how to become righteous in one&#146;s personal and practical life, how to take up arms against sinful and wicked people, and how to work pragmatically. The one who constantly ideates on Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi, keeping Him enshrined in the temple of his or her heart, and rushes towards Him, realizes Parama Purus&#x301;a through His grace and becomes one with Him. This is the theoretical side.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->In His personal life Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi identified Himself with those who were intelligent, spiritually steady, and eager to promote the cause of human welfare. He talked with them and inspired them to a more sublime life. In this way He attracted people towards Himself in the spiritual sphere. Every human being has accepted Him as their own. As a result He remains enthroned to this day in the hearts of people, despite the long interval since His advent, just like an emerald in a jewel box. In His practical life He inspired those who came in His contact, drew them to Him, showed them the path to salvation and told them in unambiguous terms that the world was created by His Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;. It shows that Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi is the be-all and end-all of human beings. He said, &ldquo;I am the Creator of this world. Everything has emanated from Me.&rdquo; Tantra has expressed this idea in a clear and lucid fashion:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..10"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Mayyeva sakalam&#x301; ja&#x301;tam&#x301; mayi sarvam&#x301; pratis&#x301;t&#x301;hitam;<br>Mayi sarvam&#x301; layam&#x301; ya&#x301;ti tad Brahma&#x301;dvayamasmyaham.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..11"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->[Everything is born out of Me, everything is maintained in Me; Everything finally merges in Me; I am that Brahma &ndash; One without a second. ]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..12"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Everything has come out of Me, everything is being maintained in Me and in the end everything will return to Me.&rdquo; Dvaeta&#x301;dvaetava&#x301;da philosophy has accepted the existence of two entities in the first stage, and thus microcosms have not been given proper recognition. Dvaeta means the existence of two entities &ndash; jiiva and Iishvara, the microcosm and the Macrocosm &ndash; but it does not explain where the jiivas originally came from. It cannot be logically accepted that the jiivas spring out of nothingness. Thus the final portion of dvaeta&#x301;dvaetava&#x301;da is acceptable, but not its beginning. Logically something which does not contain a beginning cannot possess an end. That is why it is utterly futile to try to analyse Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a in the light of dvaeta&#x301;dvaetava&#x301;da philosophy. He is far above it.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="6..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Every vibration in this universe has colour and sound. Every vibration also represents a particular idea, and hence each idea has a vibrational sound and vibrational colour. Many vibrational waves are too long or too short to be perceived by human beings - we cannot hear their sound or see their colour &ndash; but they do exist. We can speak of them as causal matrices in the realm of vibrational colour; and consider them as the biija mantras [acoustic roots] of the ideas with which they are concerned.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="6..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The sound a is the acoustic root of creation, and thus is the controller of the seven notes of Indo-Aryan music [the surasaptaka or &ldquo;seven notes&rdquo; &ndash; in Western music, the &ldquo;octave&rdquo;], which are as follows: sya or khya (s&#x301;ad&#x301;aja [peacock]<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.6.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#6.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  &ndash; the Yajurvedic pronunciation khad&#x301;aja is also permissible, but in that case kha should be pronounced with the mind concentrated on the front part of the palate and not like the second consonant of the ka varga);<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.6.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#6.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  re or r (rs&#x301;abha [ox] &ndash; the pronunciation rkhabha is also permissible, but kha should not be pronounced like the second consonant of the ka group); ga&#x301; (ga&#x301;ndha&#x301;ra [goat]); ma&#x301; (madhyama [deer]); pa&#x301; (pain&#x32D;cama [cuckoo]); dha&#x301; (dhaevata [donkey]); and ni (nis&#x301;a&#x301;da [elephant] &ndash; it can also be pronounced nikha&#x301;da, but again kha is not pronounced like the second consonant of the ka group.)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Although a indirectly controls the seven musical notes, it chiefly controls the first note, s&#x301;ad&#x301;aja. This note is represented in the surasaptaka or sargam [gamut of notes] by its initial letter, sya. Remember that in the vilambita [prolonged] technique of pronunciation of this note, the vowel sound a&#x301; is not employed;<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.6.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#6.fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> rather the sam&#x301;vrta [lengthened]<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.6.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#6.fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  pronunciation of a is employed. That is, the vowel here will not be pronounced a&#x301;-a&#x301;-a&#x301;-a&#x301;-a&#x301;-a&#x301;-a&#x301;-a&#x301;, but will be pronounced somewhat like aya, as they do in northern India. (More precisely, the pronunciation will be intermediate between aya and a&#x301;). If singers were to pay more attention to proper pronunciation, they would benefit.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->As the sound a is the acoustic root of the note s&#x301;ad&#x301;aja, the letter a is the first step in the learning of music. In Occidental music, the octave (do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do) has evolved in a similar way.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->The difference between Occidental and Oriental music is that in the former the first note, s&#x301;ad&#x301;aja [or &ldquo;do&rdquo;], is repeated at the end to form an octave. Thus in Oriental music we say surasaptaka or musical &ldquo;septave&rdquo;  (&ldquo;collection of seven notes&rdquo;) whereas in Occidental music we say &ldquo;octave&rdquo; (&ldquo;collection of eight notes&rdquo;).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Sada&#x301;shiva arranged sounds in the form of the surasaptaka, which contributed on the one hand to the acoustics of science, and on the other hand to the rhythmic phonetics of music. Hence in the study of music we cannot afford to forget his unique contribution.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->A little while ago I said that every sound has colour too. Alternative words for ram&#x301; [&ldquo;colour&rdquo;] are varn&#x301;a [which also means &ldquo;letter&rdquo;] and ra&#x301;ga. The word ra&#x301;ga is derived from the root-verb ran&#x301;j plus the suffix ghain&#x32D;, and means &ldquo;to colour&rdquo; something. By permutating and combining different sounds, Shiva created various ra&#x301;gas and arranged them in a perfect orderly sequence. In this way He created six ra&#x301;gas and thirty-six ra&#x301;giniis. This was an immense contribution to the world of music and earned him the epithet Na&#x301;datanu [Embodiment of Divine Sound] in the Vedas. Of course it was Mahars&#x301;i Bharata who popularized these ra&#x301;gas and ra&#x301;giniis amongst intellectuals.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->These ra&#x301;gas and ra&#x301;giniis are subject to changes according to the shortening or lengthening of their notes. Following this system, Indian music is divided into two main branches: northern Indian music (colloquially &ldquo;Hindustani music&rdquo;), which is popular to the north of the Vindhya Hills, and Deccan music (or &ldquo;Karnatak music&rdquo;), which is popular to the south of the Vindhya Hills. Many new ra&#x301;gas and ra&#x301;giniis are being evolved today and will be evolved in the future. There can be no end to this process of evolution. In Prabha&#x301;ta Sam&#x301;giita<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.6.fn5"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#6.fn5">5</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> also, a few new ra&#x301;gas and ra&#x301;giniis have been evolved, but they have not yet been given names.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="6..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->The sound a&#x301; is the acoustic root of rs&#x301;abha, the second musical note. This acoustic root directly controls rs&#x301;abha and indirectly controls ga&#x301;ndha&#x301;ra (ga&#x301;), madhyama (ma&#x301;), pain&#x32D;cama (pa&#x301;), dhaevata (dha&#x301;) and nis&#x301;a&#x301;da (ni). In the Vedas other than the Rgveda, we usually come across komala [soft] ni and sa&#x301;dha&#x301;ran&#x301;a [ordinary] ni. In the older portions of the Rgveda, kad&#x301;ii [hard or high-pitched] ni was used. It could be uttered with both sides of the uvula. The seven Vedic and Tantric notes, the seven Vedic metres and the two bha&#x301;va&#x301;tmaka svara [spiritual sounds] constitute the sixteen prominent sounds which in Indo-Aryan phonetics are known as s&#x301;od&#x301;asha dhvanikala&#x301; [the &ldquo;sixteen sounds&rdquo; of Brahmavidya&#x301; &ndash; intuitional science &ndash; and gandharvavidya&#x301; &ndash; the science of music]. These musical notes were used in music and incantation in different combinations according to the waxing and waning of the moon and according to the time of day or night. Accordingly, a specific period of the month and time of the day was fixed for the performance of each ra&#x301;ga and ra&#x301;ginii.<!-- /block --></p>

It directly controls ga&#x301;ndha&#x301;ra and indirectly controls madhyama (ma&#x301;), pain&#x32D;cama (pa&#x301;), dhaevata (dha&#x301;) and nis&#x301;a&#x301;da (ni).<!-- /block --></p>

A sa sound occurring in any root-verb after the prefix ni may be changed into the letter s&#x301;a, that is, nisa&#x301;da and nis&#x301;a&#x301;da are both permissible. Similarly, upanis&#x301;ad and upanisad are equally correct. But in Bengali there is a convention of using s&#x301;a in such spellings.

But the energy with which microcosms direct their physico-psycho-spiritual efforts towards the divine and reach the highest rung of the evolutionary ladder by piercing every tender layer of microcosmic existence, is called para&#x301;shakti (this para&#x301;shakti, which is the primordial phase of vocalization, is not the same as the para&#x301;shakti or Supreme Operative Principle in the unbalanced triangle of forces).

If they are already aware of the name and form of the visualized object, they can progress further in the process of expression, otherwise that name or form will continue to remain in the abstract world. This stage, in which one can mentally visualize what one is going to communicate, is the second stage in the process of vocalization. Its controlling point is the sva&#x301;dhis&#x301;t&#x301;ha&#x301;na cakra. The energy which causes the visualization is called pashyanti.

Of course just to visualize the perceived object (with the help of pashyanti shakti) is not enough; other people cannot see your mental images or mental words, because those things belong to the psychic world. Linguistic expression pertains to the mundane world. Words are transmitted in the outer world through the medium of air or electro-magnetic waves, or some such medium.

In this sense it is related to the acoustic root svadha&#x301;. The general meaning of svadha&#x301; is &ldquo;one who is self-reliant&rdquo; (sva + dha&#x301;c = svadha&#x301;). Sva&#x301;ha&#x301; is also used as an acoustic root for spiritual actions, while svadha&#x301; is used while making offerings to the ancestors.<!-- /block --></p>

One Sanskrit word for &ldquo;good&rdquo; is bhadra, from which the Bengali word bha&#x301;lo comes. The Hindi word bha&#x301;la&#x301;ii is the abstract noun of bha&#x301;la&#x301;. In old Ra&#x301;r&#x301;hii Bengali, the word bha&#x301;la&#x301; is used in the sense of &ldquo;look at&rdquo;. It is an indigenous Bengali word. Ajana&#x301; pathik ek deshke eseche bha&#x301;lgo.

When they were not conducting either of these rituals, they would place the skin around their necks (in this case it was called niviita).

The popular story goes that the great sage Vashis&#x301;t&#x301;ha travelled to China to learn the Chinese school of Tantra. In China he learnt the use of una in the utterance of Tantric mantras, and introduced it in India on his return. Una is used extensively in all the dialects of the Indo-Chinese languages, even in Tibetan, Laddaki, Sherpa, Manpa, etc. It is said that Vashis&#x301;t&#x301;ha learned that una is the acoustic root of vanity.

When one sees someone in the throes of misery one should think, &ldquo;Oh, what great misery the man is suffering from! Is there anything I can do to reduce his misery? Although the person is a human in all other respects, how crude he is in thought and behaviour. Can&#146;t I help him to arouse his latent intellect?&rdquo; This attitude of compassion is the effective counter-measure for krurata&#x301; vrtti.<!-- /block --></p>

The innate propensity of human beings is to move along the path towards subtlety in the psychic and spiritual spheres, and finally to merge into Parama Purus&#x301;a. The unbroken movement of the human mind towards Parama Purus&#x301;a is called ma&#x301;nava dharma. It moves one from a state of ordinary happiness ever forward and eventually establishes one in the realm of Supreme Beatitude.<!-- /block --></p>

<p class=footnotes_title>Footnotes</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="6.fn1"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.6.fn1">1</a></b>)   Editors&#146; note: Each of the notes is represented by a single syllable, just as in Western music the notes are represented by do-re-mi. But each of the notes is further represented by an animal associated with its syllable.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="6.fn2"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.6.fn2">2</a></b>)   Editors&#146; note: The Indo-Aryan alphabet is divided into vargas, &ldquo;groups&rdquo;, of phonetically-related sounds. The ka varga, for example (whose second consonant is kha), consists of sounds produced in the throat (gutturals).</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="6.fn3"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.6.fn3">3</a></b>)  Editors&#146; note: According to normal Sanskrit grammar, if a is followed by a, the two combine to become a&#x301;.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="6.fn4"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.6.fn4">4</a></b>)   Editors&#146; note: Of the three pronunciations used in Indian song to which the author refers, the sam&#x301;vrta is slightly prolonged, the vilambita is more prolonged, and the pluta is most prolonged.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="6.fn5"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.6.fn5">5</a></b>)  Editors&#146; note: 5018 songs composed by the author.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="6.fn6"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.6.fn6">6</a></b>)  Editors&#146; note: As indicated earlier, the Rgvedic pronunciation s&#x301;a has a corresponding Yajurvedic pronunciation kha.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="6.fn7"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.6.fn7">7</a></b>)   Editors&#146; note: In spite of the fact that it is grouped with the vowels, and that in speech people find it difficult to pronounce without giving it some vowel sound.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="6.fn8"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.6.fn8">8</a></b>)   Editors&#146; note: In cases where it is converted to ra, such as when the noun rs&#x301;i becomes the adjective a&#x301;rs&#x301;a.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="6.fn9"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.6.fn9">9</a></b>)  Editors&#146; note: The combination of the two &ndash; dot plus crescent - is paralleled in Roman Sanskrit by the letter &ldquo;n&#x32D;&rdquo;. Either the Bengali/Devanagari or the Roman version represents, so far as phonetics is concerned, a nasalization of the vowel it is associated with. Note also that m becomes m&#x301; for euphony when followed by a consonant, such as in on&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="6.fn10"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.6.fn10">10</a></b>)  Editors&#146; note: A royal ceremony in which a king would expect to be accepted as sovereign king.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="6.fn11"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.6.fn11">11</a></b>)  Author&#146;s note: As the navel area is the controlling point of the luminous factor, it is not easily burnt. It is only with the application of tremendous heat that it can be burnt to ashes. A funeral pyre does not generate sufficient heat to burn the navel area. So those who cremate their loved ones retrieve this unburnt portion from the ashes and immerse it in any holy river. This practice is popularly known as asthivisarjana.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="6.fn12"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.6.fn12">12</a></b>)  Author&#146;s note: Just as the root-verb cal [move] plus suffix shatr equals calat [that which is in motion], cal plus sha&#x301;nac equals calama&#x301;na.<br> The root-verb cal is ubhayapadii [both a&#x301;tmanepadii and parasmaepadii &ndash; terminologies of conjugation in ancient Sanskrit]. In the early part of the Vedic age it was mainly used in the a&#x301;tmanepadii form, but later on began to be used in the parasmaepadii form. In modern Sanskrit, it is used in the parasmaepadii form. Only in a few rare cases is the a&#x301;tmanepadii form used, as in the following example, a well-known utterance of Lord Buddha:<br> <br> Iha&#x301;sane shus&#x301;yatu me shariiram.<br> Tvagasthima&#x301;m&#x301;sam&#x301; pralayanca ya&#x301;tu.<br> Apra&#x301;pya bodhim&#x301; bahukalpadurlabha&#x301;m<br> Naeva&#x301;sana&#x301;t ka&#x301;yamatashcalis&#x301;yate.<br> <br> [Until I attain the highest realization, which is rare even in hundreds of lives, I will not budge an inch from this posture, even if my skin, flesh and bones dry up and my body perishes.]<br> <br> Dyotama&#x301;na&#x301; is a sha&#x301;nac-ending word. Since olden days, the a&#x301;tmanepadii form dyotate has been used.<br> <br> Dyotate kriid&#x301;ate yasma&#x301;dudyate dyotate divi;<br> Tasma&#x301;ddeva iti proktah stu&#x301;yate sarvadevataeh.<br> <br> [The vibrational manifestations emanating from the Supreme Nucleus are known as devata&#x301;s, and these devata&#x301;s address that Supreme Nucleus as Deva. He with His powers vibrates the entire universe, makes the entire universe dance; and He by dint of His occult and supra-occult powers brings everything back onto His lap.]</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="6.fn13"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.6.fn13">13</a></b>)  Author&#146;s note: Mrga literally means &ldquo;wild animal&rdquo;, and thus both a deer and a tiger are equally mrga. Hence literally mrgacarma means not only &ldquo;deerskin&rdquo;, but the skin of any wild animal. In those days the kings hunted not only deer, but also other wild animals. <br> Later on, perhaps, the deerskin became somewhat rare, so people introduced the use of cotton in its place. Even today in certain sections of Indian society people wear a piece of deerskin during the holy-thread ceremony.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="6.fn14"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.6.fn14">14</a></b>)  Editors&#146; note: This straight posture symbolizes that although one may or may not be straight in all mundane activities, one is as simple and straight as can be before the entity being revered.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="6.fn15"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.6.fn15">15</a></b>)  Author&#146;s note: Dance should not be called shilpa &ndash; literally, &ldquo;that which is done with the hands&rdquo; &ndash; because in dance, the legs, neck, chin and other parts of the body are also used. In some dances every part of the body has a certain role to play.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="6.fn16"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.6.fn16">16</a></b>)   Editors&#146; note: Philology of &ldquo;oriental&rdquo;, &ldquo;occidental&rdquo;, and other words omitted here.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="6.fn17"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.6.fn17">17</a></b>)  Editors&#146; note: Not only am&#x301; and ah, but all sixteen vowel sounds, are located at the vishuddha cakra. For correlation of other sounds with their respective cakras, see &ldquo;Plexi and Microvita&rdquo;  in Yoga Psychology.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="6.fn18"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.6.fn18">18</a></b>)  Editors&#146; note: In Ananda Marga sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, shuddhis (visualizations for withdrawing the mind) and Guru Pu&#x301;ja&#x301;.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="6.fn19"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.6.fn19">19</a></b>)  Editors&#146; note: The lokas of the Macrocosmic Mind are Its different &ldquo;levels&rdquo;, or &ldquo;layers&rdquo;, or &ldquo;spheres&rdquo;. They represent different stages on a continuum from subtle to crude. And the ka&#x301;mamaya kos&#x301;a represents such a stage in both the Macrocosmic Mind and the microcosmic mind. The ka&#x301;mamaya kos&#x301;a of the microcosm is its &ldquo;crude mind&rdquo;, as it is the layer of mind closest to the physical body. It is concerned with physical sensations and physical desires.</p>
