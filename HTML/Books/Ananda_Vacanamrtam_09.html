<a name="2..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The <I>A&#x301;nanda Vacana&#x301;mrtam</I> (&ldquo;Blissful Discourses&rdquo;) series assembles all the known General Darshana discourses given by Ma&#x301;rga Guru Shrii Shrii A&#x301;nandamu&#x301;rti. General Darshana (GD) <I>pravacanas,</I> or discourses, were those given to Ananda Marga members, often as a part of daily routine, in whatever locality Ma&#x301;rga Guru happened to be staying in at the time. Normally briefer and lighter in tone (though no less profound in their fundamental meanings) than the discourses given on the formal occasions of Dharma Maha&#x301;cakra (DMC), these <I>pravacanas</I> were sometimes delivered in a very intimate way to relatively small groups of Ma&#x301;rgiis.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The <I>A&#x301;nanda Vacana&#x301;mrtam</I> series was first begun in 1978 when the author resumed, after a gap of some years, his practice of giving regular discourses to his followers &ndash; an audience that by then included spiritual aspirants from many countries of the world as well as from India. The series began with the GD discourses given by the author at that very time; it then for several years kept pace with, and maintained the sequence of, the GD discourses that the author gave over those subsequent years. Hence the series up through Part 22, which part contained <I>pravacanas</I> from the year 1984, was published by 1985. Each part was published at least in the original language of the majority of its <I>pravacanas</I>. And as regards English translations of those parts published originally in Bengali or Hindi, such translations up through Part 8 lagged only a little behind the originals; the English Part 8 was published in 1987.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Subsequently, from the year 1994 through the year 2000, <I>A&#x301;nanda Vacana&#x301;mrtam Parts 23-34 </I>came out, containing mostly GD discourses of the author from before 1978. And of those twelve books, Part 23, Part 30, Part 31, Part 33 and Part 34 came out published originally in English. But between 2000 and the present there was no publication in English of any of the <I>A&#x301;nanda Vacana&#x301;mrtam</I> series; hence the translations of Parts 9-22, 24-29 and 32 were much overdue. There has been a long-standing demand from our esteemed readers for these parts, and the present book, <I>A&#x301;nanda Vacana&#x301;mrtam Parts 9</I> <I>&amp;</I> <I>10, </I>is a step towards the fulfilment of that demand.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph --><I>A&#x301;nanda Vacana&#x301;mrtam Parts 9</I> <I>&amp;</I> <I>10</I> contains the author&#146;s GD discourses given between February and April 1979, in Kolkata and at different places in India where the author stayed in connection with an extensive tour. These discourses are on varied topics such as spiritual philosophy, spiritual practice, history and culture; and truly contain the author&#146;s valuable and practical guidance for all.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph --><I>A&#x301;nanda Vacana&#x301;mrtam Parts 1-3 </I>and <I>5</I> came out originally in English. While reprinting those parts in 1986 and 1987, and while printing for the first time the translations of Parts 4 and 6-8, a decision was made to standardize the size of each part. The result of this was that a few of the discourses at the end of the Bengali Part 4 came out in the reprinted English Part 5; and this in turn affected subsequent parts. So now three discourses that appeared in the first Bengali edition of Part 8 appear here in the English Part 9. They are: &ldquo;Always Do the Kiirtana of the Lord&rdquo;, &ldquo;Wherever My Devotees Sing&rdquo; and &ldquo;Take Refuge in Parama Purus&#x301;a with Unswerving Attention&rdquo;. These three discourses should henceforward be considered as belonging to Part 9.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Weighing the feedback of our readers and all other considerations, we have now decided to print two parts of <I>A&#x301;nanda Vacana&#x301;mrtam</I> to a volume and to use a bigger and more conventional book size than had been used previously for the<I> A&#x301;nanda Vacana&#x301;mrtam</I> series. Henceforward, the various parts of the series will all be published in this manner.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Of the twenty-six discourses herein, fifteen were originally given by the author in Bengali and eleven originally in Hindi. The discourses &ldquo;History of Bengal &ndash; 1&rdquo; and &ldquo;History of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;hbhu&#x301;m&rdquo; had been translated into English in 1988 and had appeared in <I>A Few Problems Solved Part 3,</I> and &ldquo;&#x301;Take Refuge in Parama Purus&#x301;a with Unswerving Attention&#146;&rdquo; had appeared in <I>Discourses on Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a and the Giita&#x301;,</I> 1999. (&ldquo;&#x301;Take Refuge in Parama Purus&#x301;a with Unswerving Attention&#146;&rdquo; had appeared in <I>Discourses on Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a and the Giita&#x301;</I> as &ldquo;&#x301;Bhajate Ma&#x301;manyabha&#x301;k&#146;&rdquo;. In the next printing of that book the title &ldquo;&#x301;Take Refuge in Parama Purus&#x301;a with Unswerving Attention&#146;&rdquo; will be used.). Minor English re-editing of these three discourses has now been done by our staff. The rest of the discourses have been newly translated (in all cases from their Bengali versions) for the present book.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Within the present book, as within each part of <I>A&#x301;nanda Vacana&#x301;mrtam,</I> the chronological order of the discourses has been maintained.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->To assist researchers, it is our policy to indicate in the Publisher&#146;s Note &ndash; in addition to the original language of each discourse, the date and place, by whom it was translated, and where, if other than in this book, it was originally published &ndash; whether or not a tape of the speech is in existence. At the time of this printing, however, not all the cataloguing of tapes has been finished. Further information as to tapes will be given in future printings.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Footnotes by the translators have all been signed &ldquo;&ndash;Trans.&rdquo; Unsigned footnotes are those of the author.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Many readers are concerned that the author&#146;s discourses, as published, should adhere as closely as possible to the precise wording the author used in speaking. For this reason, in the case of discourses given originally in English, the editors do not alter pronouns and other terms which the author in his life time considered &ldquo;common-gender&rdquo; words. As the author once said, &ldquo;You know, &lsquo;man&rsquo; is not only masculine gender, &lsquo;man&rsquo; is common gender also. &lsquo;Man is mortal&rsquo; &ndash; here &lsquo;man&rsquo; means both male and female.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->The author was a natural advocate of women&#146;s rights and on at least one occasion indicated that &ldquo;lopsided justice&rdquo; in language should be eliminated at some future date. In keeping with his guideline and with present-day trends, it is our policy in the case of translated discourses (where the published wording will necessarily be that of the translators) to use gender-neutral language.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Square brackets [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;] in the text are used to indicate translations by the editors or other editorial insertions. Round brackets (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) indicate a word or words originally given by the author.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->The author used a certain shorthand for explaining the etymologies of words. Under this system, a minus sign (&ndash;) follows a prefix, and a plus sign (+) precedes a suffix. Thus <I>ava &ndash; tr + ghain&#x32D; = avata&#x301;ra</I> can be read, &ldquo;the root <I>tr</I> prefixed by <I>ava</I> and suffixed by <I>ghain&#x32D; </I>becomes <I>avata&#x301;ra.</I>&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="2..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->This book is the result of the assistance and the support lent by many persons in various ways. Their sincere efforts are helping us develop an ever more professional system of work, so that the immense contribution of Shrii P.R. Sarkar can be presented in the best possible manner. Some esteemed readers, or better to say, lovers, of Shrii P.R. Sarkar&#146;s books have come forward to make arrangement for the continuous publication of his books over the coming years; thanks to them, progress is being made in building up a committed and dependable sales network. Any interested person can come forward to participate in this effort.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Ideally every new book translation undergoes initially a draft by the main translator, then &ldquo;first editing&rdquo;, then &ldquo;second editing&rdquo;, then final verification. Other important functions include coordination of the different steps, and the development and management of a sales network. Some of those who have contributed to these efforts: Deva&#x301;shiis&#x301;a translated (from the original Bengali) all sixteen of the discourses taken from <I>A&#x301;nanda Vacana&#x301;mrtam Parts 8 </I>and <I>9</I>. Deva&#x301;shiis&#x301;a also did the semi-final verification of the eight discourses from <I>A&#x301;nanda Vacana&#x301;mrtam Part 10</I> that had not previously been published in English. Prof. A&#x301;ditya Mohanty translated all of the eight discourses from <I>A&#x301;nanda Vacana&#x301;mrtam Part 10</I> that had not previously been published in English. Ga&#x301;yattrii Ghista and Ta&#x301;raka Ghista did the second editing of those same eight discourses. Ga&#x301;yattrii Ghista and Shiva Mazzola re-edited the two discourses of <I>A&#x301;nanda Vacana&#x301;mrtam Part 10</I> which had previously been published in <I>A Few Problems Solved Part 3</I>. Ma&#x301;dhava Basak did typing, DTP work and office work. Vasanthan Parameswara proofread the entire book after its second editing. Kirit Dave took on sales management and coordination work.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="3..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->There are three kinds of people &ndash; inferior, middling and superior. Inferior people are those who think one thing, say another and do something else. There is no harmony among their thoughts, speech and actions; rather they are opposed to one another. They are hypocrites. The middling class of person is one who keeps their thoughts secret and neither speaks nor acts accordingly. And what is the best class of human being? One who acts in accordance with their thoughts is the best class of human being. Such type of people we call honest people, good people.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->What will a good person do? <I>Trn&#x301;a&#x301;dapi suniicena</I> [humble like a blade of grass]. They will stay away from ego because ego is the root cause of downfall. If ego is present then downfall is inevitable. How is ego manifested in individual life? It expresses itself through superiority complex. I am great and everyone else is small, degraded, lowly. &ldquo;I am superior&rdquo; &ndash; this feeling or thought is called &ldquo;superiority complex&rdquo; in English and <I>maha&#x301;manyata&#x301;</I> in Sanskrit. Due to this sense of ego one behaves poorly with others. For this reason it is said in the scriptures: <I>trin&#x301;a&#x301;dapi suniicena</I>. For example, a blade of grass remains underneath everyone. It has no ego, yet it possesses more qualities than anyone. Human beings should keep themselves aloof in every way from superiority complex and pride. Good people will stay away from ego. Why will they do so? Good people know what are the causes behind the rise of ego. One person has knowledge, another has money. A good person knows that this money and this knowledge is not theirs; it belongs to <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I>. Today it has come to me and again it will leave me. I had none of these when I was born and at the time of death they won&#146;t remain with me. For this reason good people will stay away from ego.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph --><I>Trn&#x301;a&#x301;dapi suniicena taroriva sahis&#x301;n&#x301;una&#x301;</I>. Have the power to endure like a tree. See, a person reacts immediately to some action. Perhaps someone has a harsh word or two for you. You also give that person a stern reply right away. This is very easy. It does not test at all your power to endure and as a result you do not get an opportunity to develop your self-confidence. But when you endure it, you test just how much capacity to endure you have in your life. This capacity to endure strengthens your nervous system. And then what happens? Your <I>cakras</I>, your brain, your intellect &ndash; all become fortified. If your intellect becomes strong then many difficult tasks will become easy. In this way you will easily be victorious.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph --><I>Ama&#x301;nina&#x301;m&#x301; ma&#x301;nadeyam&#x301;</I> [&ldquo;You must give respect to those whom no one respects&rdquo;]. Everything in this universe is the manifestation of <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I>. Big or small, every entity is the expression of the Supreme Father. But what happens in this world? Due to various social defects many flaws persist in the social structure. Due to this unworthy people are given respect while worthy people are disdained. There is one cause behind this &ndash; social defects. One can find a lot of people who show respect to those not worthy of  receiving it &ndash; <I>sarve gun&#x301;a&#x301;h ka&#x301;in&#x32D;canam&#x301; a&#x301;shrayanti</I> [&ldquo;Those who <I></I>have wealth have all qualities&rdquo;] &ndash; but it is not right if worthy people are disrespected. Thus one should bear this thought in mind that I will show respect to those who are given no respect. Those in society who are downtrodden, fallen, ignorant or so-called little people, I will show them respect. We may or may not be  respectful in front of the so-called  superior people, but the so-called lower-class people deserve respect  because they are the expression of <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I>, they are also the children of the Supreme Father. Why will I show respect? Well, if I show respect my respect will not decrease but rather increase. <I>Ama&#x301;nina&#x301;m&#x301; ma&#x301;nadeyam&#x301;</I>.  These are all qualities of good people.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Who is a good person? Previously it has been said: <I>kiirtaniiyah sada&#x301; harih</I>. One should always do the <I>kiirtana</I> of the Lord. What does <I>kiirtana</I> mean? To sing in a loud voice the qualities of the Lord &ndash; not mentally. If it is done mentally then we call it <I>japa</I>. And when it is vocalized then we call it <I>kiirtana</I>. Why does <I>kiirtana</I> have to be vocalized? The science behind it is that when you do <I>kiirtana</I> loudly your mind remains engaged. It cannot do anything else. At that time it is not possible to abuse someone or to have a worldly conversation. The mind is busy vocalizing, rather I will say that it is given over to the vocalization. The vocal cords are busy in that, the mind is employed in that thought, and the ears are hearing it, they don&#146;t have any chance to go here and there. For this reason the rule of vocalizing <I>kiirtana</I> loudly makes it both heard and sung. <I>Kiirtan</I> is not done softly.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Now whose <I>kiirtana</I> should be done? Hari&#146;s. Who is Hari? In Bhopal I said: <I>Harati pa&#x301;pam&#x301; ityarthe harih</I>&#151;He steals sins. He who steals sins is Hari. <I>Haran&#x301; kara&#x301;</I> means &ldquo;to steal.&rdquo; This goes against the instruction in <I>Yama-Niyama</I> [moral principles] to follow <I>asteya. Asteya</I> means non-stealing. But <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> steals. This is very bad. <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> has Himself said that it is not proper to steal, that one should be established in <I>Yama-Niyama</I>, but He Himself steals. This is quite bad.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Yes, He steals and He must steal, He is compelled to do so. Now what does He steal? <I>Harati pa&#x301;pam&#x301; ityarthe harih</I>. <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I>, the Supreme Father, loves His affectionate sons and daughters very much. He also loves to scold and discipline His created beings for their own welfare.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->You will notice how much sin a person commits in one lifetime. So how much sin has that person committed over the course of lifetimes! It is well nigh impossible to find someone who has not committed any sin. Everyone has committed one sin or another. One person&#146;s sins are as vast as a mountain and another&#146;s are perhaps very small. One person is a diamond thief and another steals cucumbers. Hence the matter becomes very complex. In this case what should be done? <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> knows that if his sons and daughters have to carry the burden of all their sins then what to speak of one lifetime, they won&#146;t exhaust their sins even over thousands of lifetimes. Think, for how many lifetimes will they have to bear the burden of their sins? <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> does not want his affectionate children have to bear the burden of their sins life after life, for thousands of lifetimes. In this case what will his children do? Well, let them give the burden of their sins to <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I>. <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> wants to bear their burden but the devotees say, &ldquo;No, no, no. O <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I>, we will feed you, we will entertain you, we will arrange singing and dancing in your honour, but we will never give you our sins. We won&#146;t. We simply won&#146;t.&rdquo; This is a terrible situation. <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> loves his sons and daughters so much. So what will he do? When He sees that His devotees are not ready to give their accumulated sins to Him then He steals those sins without His devotee&#146;s knowledge. Thus His other name is Hari, or thief.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->If you do not do the <I>kiirtana</I> for this Hari who loves his devotees so deeply, then whose <I>kiirtana</I> will you do? For this reason it has been said: <I>kiirtaniiyah sada&#x301; harih</I>. Always do the <I>kiirtana</I> of Hari. Here Hari means <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I>, the Supreme Father. This is the goal of good people. Good people will do this alone.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="4..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->You all know that the meaning of the Sanskrit word <I>tan&#x301;d&#x301;u</I> is &ldquo;jumping&rdquo; or &ldquo;leaping&rdquo;, and <I>tan&#x301;d&#x301;ula</I> means &ldquo;rice&rdquo;. Rice is called <I>tan&#x301;d&#x301;ula</I> because the rice kernels jump when they are separated from the husk. Thus <I>ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava</I> also means &ldquo;jumping&rdquo;. While jumping, when the knee comes up to the navel or above it then it is called <I>brahmata&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava</I>, and when the knee goes above the <I>ana&#x301;hata cakra</I> then it is called <I>vis&#x301;n&#x301;uta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava</I> , and when the knee crosses the <I>vishuddha cakra</I> it is called <I>rudrata&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava</I>. All of you should remember this.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Today at noon I talked about the fundamental principles of devotion. The subject of discourse was &ldquo;Kiirtaniiyah Sada&#x301; Harih&rdquo;. In it I discussed what should be the cardinal principles of a gentleman, what their nature should be. What is <I>kiirtana</I>, what is Hari? I also talked about that. Did you all understand it properly?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph --><I>Kiirtaniiyah sada&#x301; Harih</I>. The devotee will do the <I>kiirtana</I> of Hari. At that time what will Hari do? That is one question. The devotee is very dear to Hari and Hari is also very dear to the devotee. And Hari steals the devotee&#146;s sins. All this takes place. But when the devotee does the <I>kiirtana</I> of Hari, what will Hari do then? You know, if, when the devotee does <I>kiirtana</I>, the mantra is a <I>siddha mantra</I> (<I>kiirtana</I> has <I>siddha mantras</I>), an <I>as&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301;ks&#x301;arii siddha mantra</I>, that is, having eight syllables and also being <I>siddha</I> [consecrated and infused with tremendous power], then as a result a certain environment is created, a special wave is created. Why is this wave produced? Each spiritual aspirant while doing <I>kiirtana</I> feels that a special wave is produced. How does it happen? Where does this wave come from? When the devotees do <I>kiirtana</I> they themselves create a certain environment. That wave emanates from the nucleus of this environment. The way that the devotees create this environment is called <I>haripariman&#x301;d&#x301;ala </I>in the scriptures. <I>Pariman&#x301;d&#x301;ala</I> means &ldquo;environment&rdquo;. This wave emanates from the <I>haripariman&#x301;d&#x301;ala</I>. At that time where does Hari remain? There is a <I>shloka</I> prevalent in the scriptures &ndash;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..4"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Na&#x301;ham&#x301; tis&#x301;t&#x301;ha&#x301;mi vaekun&#x301;t&#x301;he yogina&#x301;m&#x301; hrdaye na ca;<br>Madbhakta&#x301;h yatra ga&#x301;yanti tatra tis&#x301;t&#x301;ha&#x301;mi na&#x301;rada.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Na&#x301;rada asks the question: &ldquo;It is true that you are all-pervading, but while you are everywhere you still control everything while remaining in one specific place. You control everything from one particular nucleus &ndash; this is also true. But where is this nucleus? Where is your actual residence?&rdquo; Na&#x301;rada asks Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a this.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->What does the word <I>na&#x301;rada</I> mean? The word <I>na&#x301;ra</I> has three meanings in Sanskrit. One meaning of the word <I>na&#x301;ra</I> is <I>niira</I>, that is, &ldquo;water&rdquo;. The second meaning is <I>Parama&#x301; Prakrti</I>, the Supreme Operative Principle. <I>Na&#x301;ra</I> means <I>prakrti</I> and <I>ayan&#x301;a</I> means &ldquo;shelter&rdquo;. Thus the one in whom <I>na&#x301;ra</I> or <I>prakrti</I> is sheltered, <I>prakrti</I>&#146;s shelter, is <I>Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a</I>. <I>Na&#x301;ra</I> means <I>prakrti</I> and <I>ayan&#x301;a</I> means &ldquo;shelter&rdquo;. The <I>ayan&#x301;a</I> of <I>na&#x301;ra</I> is <I>Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a</I>. And the third meaning of the word <I>na&#x301;ra</I> is &ldquo;devotion&rdquo;. <I>Na&#x301;ra + da = na&#x301;rada</I>. In Sanskrit <I>da</I> means &ldquo;one who gives&rdquo;. Hence <I>na&#x301;rada</I> means &ldquo;one who gives <I>na&#x301;ra</I>, or devotion, one who distributes devotion&rdquo;. Na&#x301;rada was a great devotee. That Na&#x301;rada&#146;s question was: &ldquo;Lord, where do you stay? Where is your true dwelling? Where is your nucleus really located? You are everywhere but where is your nucleus?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph --><I>Na&#x301;ham&#x301; tis&#x301;t&#x301;ha&#x301;mi vaekun&#x301;t&#x301;he</I>. Some people say that Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a remains in <I>vaekun&#x301;t&#x301;ha</I> [heaven]. <I>Vaekun&#x301;t&#x301;ha </I>does not mean a far-away land. <I>Kun&#x301;t&#x301;ha&#x301;</I> means &ldquo;contraction.&rdquo; For example, people are contracted in the cold; they are contracted out of fear or shame. So <I>vaekun&#x301;t&#x301;ha </I>is used in the sense of contraction having passed, that is, where the mind does not undergo any kind of contraction, where it is liberated, free, absorbed in the love of the <I>Parama&#x301;tma&#x301;</I>. Where there is no <I>kun&#x301;t&#x301;ha&#x301;</I> it is <I>vaekun&#x301;t&#x301;ha</I>. <I>Vaekun&#x301;t&#x301;ha</I> does not mean a distant place. When there is no contraction in your mind then there is the dawn of <I>vaekun&#x301;t&#x301;ha </I>in your mind. This is <I>vaekun&#x301;t&#x301;ha</I>. But here Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a says, &ldquo;I do not remain in <I>vaekun&#x301;t&#x301;ha</I>&rdquo;&ndash; <I>na&#x301;ham&#x301; tis&#x301;t&#x301;ha&#x301;mi vaekun&#x301;t&#x301;he</I>. Why does he not remain there? It is true that where there is no contraction the devotees get the Lord, because the mind is not contracted. However, here there is no emanation of the wave of <I>kiirtana</I>. Only one person will feel it, will attain bliss. It will not be possible for that person to distribute bliss to everyone. Thus He says, <I>na&#x301;ham&#x301; tis&#x301;t&#x301;ha&#x301;mi vaekun&#x301;t&#x301;he</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Again He says: <I>yogina&#x301;m&#x301; hrdaye na ca</I>. What does <I>yogii</I> mean? The word <I>yogii</I> has several meanings. One meaning is: <I>sarvacinta&#x301;paritya&#x301;gonishcinto yoga ucyate</I>. Or <I>yogashcittavrttinirodhah</I>. Another meaning is: <I>sam&#x301;yogo yoga ityuktah jiiva&#x301;tma&#x301; parama&#x301;tmanah</I>. In this way there are many explanations. But what does a yogi do? The yogi brings the <I>cittavrtti</I>, that is, the mental propensities to cessation, suspends and stops them. In that state all the mental propensities cease, that is, all their mental propensities are suspended, remain in a suspended state; there cannot be expression of any of [[one&#146;s]] feelings. If Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a remains there [[the yogi]] will not have any expression. The yogi feels the presence of the <I>Parama&#x301;tma&#x301;</I> in their heart but in this state there cannot be any outward emanation of that wave, as happens in <I>kiirtana</I>. Although <I>Parama&#x301;tma&#x301;</I> is present in a yogi&#146;s heart, it is a kind of dry desert. It is not sweet.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->But <I>kiirtana</I> has <I>raso vae sah</I>. He is full of <I>rasa</I> i.e. sweetness, full of bliss. People derive bliss from it. They get bliss from <I>kiirtana</I>. So if Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a were to reside in a yogi&#146;s heart then no one would enjoy bliss; only that yogi would enjoy bliss. So what does Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a say? <I>Madbhakta&#x301;h yatra ga&#x301;yanti tatra tis&#x301;t&#x301;ha&#x301;mi na&#x301;rada</I>. He says: &ldquo;O Na&#x301;rada, I reside where my devotees do my <I>kiirtana</I>.&rdquo; In other words, &ldquo;I go where my devotees are doing <I>kiirtana</I>, where they are creating the <I>Haripariman&#x301;d&#x301;ala</I>.&rdquo; This is why people get bliss from <I>kiirtana</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->I have said that doing <I>kiirtana</I> is the definite duty of every spiritual aspirant. In <I>kiirtana</I> the mind becomes very elevated. One gets bliss. One gets the wave of Hari, and if a person sits for meditation immediately thereafter then they will also experience great bliss in their meditation. Thus doing <I>kiirtana</I> is definitely a necessity for every spiritual aspirant.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="5..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph --><I>Karma</I> means &ldquo;change of position of objects&rdquo;. When there is no change of position of an object, there is no <I>karma</I> either. There are two main types of <I>karma</I><!-- fn --><a name="Ref.5.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#5.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> &ndash; <I>nitya karma</I> [action of regular nature] and <I>naemittika karma</I> [action of occasional nature]. <I>Nitya karma</I> is neutral by nature. It does not bring any benefit to anyone, nor cause any harm to anyone. Various discriminations, on the other hand, enter in regarding <I>naemittika karma</I>. <I>Naemittika karmas</I> that follow proper standards are <I>pun&#x301;ya karmas</I> [virtuous actions], while <I>naemittika karmas</I> that do not follow such standards are <I>pa&#x301;pa karmas</I> [sinful actions].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Virtuous actions, again, are of two types &ndash; direct and indirect. What are direct virtuous actions? Suppose someone is hungry and thirsty, and you offer the person food and drink. This is a direct virtuous action, by which you acquire virtue. Virtuous actions do good to others and also elevate the doer. &ldquo;Elevation&rdquo;, or &ldquo;progress&rdquo;, is used here to convey the idea that personally you are coming nearer and nearer to <I>Parama&#x301;tma&#x301;</I> [the Supreme Soul]; and the person whom you have helped has also benefited.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Indirect virtuous actions have the same effect &ndash; they bring good to others and elevation or progress to one&#146;s self. The difference here is that the good that is wrought comes about after some delay. Nevertheless, that good does result, and it is long-lasting &ndash; it can be felt for thousands of years. For example, suppose someone plants the seedling of a large shade tree today. We cannot expect to enjoy the shade with immediate effect; but it will start to provide shade thirty or thirty-five years later, and will continue for thousands of years. This is an indirect virtuous action. All these actions bring about good. Someone digs a big canal somewhere; someone else plants a tree; these are different kinds of good work. Indirect virtuous actions are also of two types.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Suppose someone builds a hospital for the treatment of the sick. That will be a direct virtuous action. But suppose the person donates some money for the development of society; that may be either a direct or an indirect virtuous action. If people benefit immediately from such a donation, it will be a [direct] virtuous action, and if the benefits are delayed, it will be an indirect virtuous action. But the advantage of an indirect virtuous action is that while the results may be delayed, they will continue for a very long time.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Sin<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.5.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#5.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> is also of two types. An action of yours that brings harm to others and brings about your own downfall is called <I>pa&#x301;pa</I> [sin]. In this kind of <I>karma</I>, harm to others goes hand in hand with your own degradation. Humans become far removed from <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> by such actions. I said before that <I>pa&#x301;pa</I> is also of two types &ndash; <I>pa&#x301;taka</I> and <I>pratyava&#x301;ya</I>. An action that should not be done but that is nevertheless done, is called <I>pa&#x301;taka</I>. And an action that should be done but is not done, is called <I>pratyava&#x301;ya</I>. For instance, one should not steal; so if anybody steals, that will be <I>pa&#x301;taka</I>. And if one knows full well that nursing a patient is good, but refrains from doing so, that will be <I>pratyava&#x301;ya</I>. People say that <I>pratyava&#x301;ya</I> is worse than <I>pa&#x301;taka</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Now, <I>pa&#x301;taka</I> [sin of commission] is divided into three categories &ndash; <I>pa&#x301;taka</I>, <I>atipa&#x301;taka</I> [major sin of commission], and <I>maha&#x301;pa&#x301;taka</I> [great sin of commission]. Someone might have committed a <I>pa&#x301;taka</I>, but after that wrong action feels repentance, and compensates for the harm his or her action caused. After such repentance and compensation, the action is no longer a sin. Suppose someone has stolen a thousand rupees from someone else. If after this theft the thief feels compunction and returns the money &ndash; better, however, with the inclusion of interest thereon &ndash; and begs forgiveness, that will mean that the person&#146;s sin has been washed away. The person should no longer be called a sinner.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->What is <I>atipa&#x301;taka</I>? Suppose someone chops off the fingers of someone else. In that case there is no scope for atonement of the crime, because to make good the severed fingers is not possible. If the person sincerely desires to atone, that person must give up everything else in life and devote himself or herself exclusively to worshipping <I>Parama&#x301;tma&#x301;,</I> <I>Parameshvara</I>. That will be the only atonement. From the social viewpoint there is no scope for atonement. But from the spiritual viewpoint alone, there can be this kind of atonement &ndash; one will have to forsake all mundane duties and dedicate oneself to the worship of <I>Parama&#x301;tma&#x301;</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->What is <I>maha&#x301;pa&#x301;taka</I>? <I>Maha&#x301;pa&#x301;taka</I> is like <I>atipa&#x301;taka</I>. But what happens in the case of <I>maha&#x301;pa&#x301;taka</I> is that others are likely to see such sinful acts, take them as examples, and indulge in them themselves. For example, someone may adulterate foodstuffs; he or she may mix papaya seeds [[in with]] the black pepper. Following this example, other business people are prompted to adulterate. In other words, the sin gets perpetuated recurrently. This is <I>maha&#x301;pa&#x301;taka</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->From the social point of view there is no scope to atone for such <I>maha&#x301;pa&#x301;taka</I>. How can one atone from the spiritual point of view? Abandoning all of one&#146;s personal enjoyments and comforts, one should devote oneself completely to spiritual sadhana and social service. This is the only means of atoning for <I>maha&#x301;pa&#x301;taka</I> from the spiritual point of view.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph --><I>Pa&#x301;takiis</I> can, if they wish, atone instantly for what they have done. But for <I>atipa&#x301;takiis</I> and <I>maha&#x301;pa&#x301;takiis</I>, such instant atonement is impossible. Atonement for <I>atipa&#x301;takiis</I> is spiritual atonement. And that spiritual atonement will continue as long as mercy from Parama&#x301;tma&#x301; is not forthcoming. Atonement on the social level can be effected through social service, but society cannot grant the forgiveness involved in spiritual atonement; <I>Parama&#x301;tma&#x301;,</I> however, can.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->So what is the way? There are many people in the world who were once <I>atipa&#x301;takiis,</I> maybe three or four births ago, but are no longer so.

<a name="5..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Here example of Ra&#x301;van&#x301;a can be taken up. In the epic story, the <I>Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a</I>, Ra&#x301;van&#x301;a <I></I>was losing his battle with Ra&#x301;ma. In the last stage of the battle Ra&#x301;van&#x301;a cried out to Shiva, &ldquo;Save me, save me.&rdquo; He was a devotee of Shiva and had become immensely powerful after receiving a boon from Shiva. Ra&#x301;van&#x301;a cried out but Shiva did nothing.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Then Pa&#x301;rvatii said to Shiva: &ldquo;Ra&#x301;van&#x301;a is a great devotee of yours but you are not saving him. What is this?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="5..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;If you do not save him, I will.&rdquo; Pa&#x301;rvatii told him.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;How can you save him?&rdquo; Shiva replied. &ldquo;You cannot save him either because he is a <I>maha&#x301;pa&#x301;takii</I>.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;But he is not a <I>maha&#x301;pa&#x301;takii</I>, he is only an <I>atipa&#x301;takii</I> [middle level sinner],&rdquo; Pa&#x301;rvatii said. &ldquo;He has abducted another&#146;s wife, so he is an <I>atipa&#x301;takii</I>.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Had he gone as a thief and abducted another&#146;s wife,&rdquo; Shiva explained, &ldquo;then he would have been considered an <I>atipa&#x301;takii</I>. But instead he kidnapped Siita&#x301; disguised as a sa&#x301;dhu. And with what result? In the future others may kidnap someone else&#146;s wife in the guise of a sa&#x301;dhu. With <I></I>Ra&#x301;van&#x301;a&#146;s example others will learn this evil deed. And furthermore, in the future, no respectable woman will ever trust a sa&#x301;dhu. She will think that the man may be another Ra&#x301;van&#x301;a disguised as a sa&#x301;dhu, in reality a thief. Thus Ra&#x301;van&#x301;a&#146;s actions are those of a <I>maha&#x301;pa&#x301;takii</I>. They will have a recurring influence. So it is not possible to save the life of that <I>maha&#x301;pa&#x301;takii</I>. Untill a <I>maha&#x301;pa&#x301;takii</I> leaves everything for the sake of spiritual ideology and dedicates himself to the service of humanity, there can be no spiritual or social atonement for him. So what can I do?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->There are <I>atipa&#x301;takiis</I> and <I>maha&#x301;pa&#x301;takiis</I> in the world even today. But they are also children of the Supreme Father. The Supreme Father is not merely a judge or lawyer. Honest or dishonest, sinner or virtuous &ndash; whatever people may be &ndash; with each and everyone He has a personal relationship. He is the Father of the world &ndash; not merely a judge. So He says: &ldquo;No, my children should not have to carry the burden of their sins forever&rdquo; &ndash; that He does not want. In the scriptures the normal word for <I>pa&#x301;taka</I> is <I>dos&#x301;a</I>; so a <I>pa&#x301;takii</I> is called a <I>dus&#x301;t&#x301;a</I>, an <I>atipa&#x301;takii</I> is called a <I>du&#x301;ra&#x301;ca&#x301;rii</I>, and a <I>maha&#x301;pa&#x301;takii</I> is a <I>sudu&#x301;ra&#x301;ca&#x301;rii</I>. All these three types of people should be avoided; one should stay away from them.

<a name="6..2"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Kalih shaya&#x301;no bhavati sain&#x32D;jiha&#x301;nastu dva&#x301;parah;<br>Uttis&#x301;t&#x301;han treta&#x301; bhavati kratam&#x301; sampadyate caran&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="6..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->When human beings remain steeped in ignorance, when they remain asleep in the darkness of ignorance, then that is the age of <I>kali</I> in their lives. <I>Satya, Treta&#x301;, Dva&#x301;para</I> and <I>Kali yugas</I> [ages] have no significance apart from [such psychological significances]. When human beings neglect their duties, when they cannot discriminate between right and wrong, when they tolerate injustice and humiliation as a natural law, it means that they are under the sway of <I>kali yuga</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The Sanskrit root <I>yuj</I> and <I>yunj</I> have similar meanings. <I>Yuj</I> means &ldquo;to add&rdquo;, as does <I>yunj</I>. <I></I>For example, two plus two equals four. There is, however, a certain difference between the two. When the word &ldquo;yoga&rdquo; is derived from the root verb <I>yuj</I> it means &ldquo;addition&rdquo;, no doubt, but here the added components retain their original identity, just as when sand and sugar are added together the individual grains can still be identified. The root verb <I>yunj</I>, however, refers to a type of addition where the original components lose their respective identities, as in the case of a mixture of sugar and water which creates a syrup in which the sugar can no longer be separately identified. Similarly, when a unit being <I>(jiiva)</I> merges into <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I>, it loses its microcosmic identity and only one entity remains, the Supreme Entity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->The word <I>yuga</I> is derived from this verb <I>yunj</I>. What is a <I>yuga</I>? When a particular period of time ends, when a particular epoch ends, when a particular flow of life ends and another begins or emerges, it is called <I>yuga</I>. The past may be divided into various <I>yugas</I> or ages: the <I>shudra yuga</I> or worker age; the <I>ks&#x301;atriya yuga</I> or warrior age; the <I>vipra yuga</I> or intellectual age; and the <I>vaeshya yuga</I> or capitalist age. In the future also these ages will come and go. People will reject the old social order and embrace a new one. The transitional phase between the two social orders is called <I>yuga sandhi</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->When people are so inert that they turn a blind eye to what happens around them, when they ignore the future of others, of society, even of themselves, when they remain blissfully unaware that they too have a significant role to play in checking the degeneration of society, then it is called <I>kali yuga</I>. They are asleep.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph --><I>Sain&#x32D;jiha&#x301;nastu dva&#x301;parah</I>. There are some people who also continue to lie down, but who have awakened, who have become conscious. They feel the need to act but fail to do so. This also happens in collective life. Suppose something is going on for a long time. We see it happening, even understand what is happening, yet we fail to do anything about it. &ldquo;This is what should be done,&rdquo; &ldquo;This is what should have been done,&rdquo; &ldquo;This should have been done a long time ago&rdquo; &ndash; people make such comments but due to the lack of dynamic leadership they fail to take action. Who is to bell the cat? This is the general feeling of the <I>dva&#x301;par yuga. Sain&#x32D;jiha&#x301;nastu dva&#x301;parah</I>. People have awakened from sleep, become conscious but they have not yet taken any action.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph --><I>Uttis&#x301;t&#x301;han treta&#x301; bhavati</I>. When people no longer pass idle comments from the comfort of their beds &ndash; &ldquo;Oh, I think this should be done or that should be done, I am to start action&rdquo;&ndash; but rather, able to discriminate between right and wrong, leap up, ready for action, it is called <I>treta&#x301; yuga</I> in both individual and collective life. <I>Uttis&#x301;t&#x301;han treta&#x301; bhavati</I>. &ldquo;Now it is time to act. We must act right now.&rdquo; People meet together in groups of five or ten or twenty, and so on, to make concrete plans for immediate and effective action. Awareness exists but it is yet to be translated into action.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph --><I>Krtam&#x301; sampadyate caran&#x301;</I>. Suppose one makes comprehensive plans and programs, but these plans still remain at a theoretical level. It is a paper tiger. No work is accomplished. It doesn&#146;t make for progress in individual life. What then needs to be done? They have to be translated into action. When people undertake concrete work with sincerity, then success becomes inevitable in their lives. This is the <I>krta yuga</I> [age of practical action] or <I>satya yuga</I> [age of truth]. It is the way human beings have advanced in the past, how they are advancing now, and how they will advance in the future.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Earlier I mentioned that just as a <I>yuga sandhi</I> occurs in individual life &ndash; one particular stage ends and another stage begins, and the in-between phase is called <I>yuga sandhi</I> &ndash; the exact same thing happens in collective life. Suppose there is a particular community. It may consist of a few thousand or a few hundred thousand or a few million. They were asleep for a long time during which they endured countless indignities, humiliation and complete subservience to their master. No one paid them any heed or respect. But when their <I>kali yuga</I> gave way to <I>dva&#x301;para yuga</I> and consciousness awakened among them, then others started to fear them. &ldquo;Uh oh, they are waking up!&rdquo; In individual life as well the same thing happens. Human beings pass their days as if they were dogs or cats or goats. They come to the earth, eat, sleep, die and move on. It is meaningless. There must be consciousness and to be established in this consciousness people have to stand up. They have to move ahead. It is the same whether it is individual or collective. According to our philosophy, when consciousness arises in individual life then a person begins to move in accordance with certain instructions, certain guidance. In collective life as well, when this stage comes, those who are well advanced, who understand better, who are more courageous, more firmly established in morality, who are truly righteous, they have to take the lead, to assume the mantle of leadership. In such times those who worry about what others will say or think, or worry about being criticized, and due to this fear hide behind closed doors thinking that if they take action their good name will be tarnished, such people are not true human beings. They are beggars, begging for reputation. They have no manliness; they have lost the courage to move ahead. At that time those who come forward and say &ndash; &ldquo;Let&#146;s go. I&#146;m with you. If trouble comes, let it come. I&#146;ll take it on my shoulders&rdquo; &ndash; such people I have given the name <I>sadvipra</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->This is the way it has been and the way it will always be. However, in collective life at the critical juncture between one great age and another, in this transitional stage of great change, when it becomes impossible for the common man or even ordinary sadvipras to take up the leadership, then <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> through his special grace arranges that leadership. At this time on the earth humanity is witnessing such a <I>yuga sandhi</I>. On one side there is the rubbish heap of the past and people are clinging to that rubbish heap because they have not yet been shown the way out. And on the other side, there is the call of the new. Under such conditions what will that <I>Maha&#x301;sambhu&#x301;ti</I> do who gave guidance to the human race in the past? With courage he will call to human beings and declare: &ldquo;Give up the rubbish of the past. It can only harm you and lead you to your death. Move ahead. Answer the call of the new. I am with you. There is no reason to be afraid.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

Similarly, <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> is called by different names. Due to ignorance human beings fight over the names.

He enters the innermost recesses of the mind and knows its hidden secrets, for He is omnipresent, omniscient and all-pervading.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->The lack of knowledge or a failure to understand the underlying meaning of things, creates misunderstandings. Take, for instance, the following. Ra&#x301;ma is a prevalent name. The word Ra&#x301;ma has come from the Sanskrit root verb <I>ram</I> plus the suffix <I>ghain&#x32D;</I>. What does the word Ra&#x301;ma <I></I>mean? The word is used for <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> or God. Ra&#x301;ma <I></I>means <I>ramante yoginah yasmin</I> &#151; the one through whose ideation or proximity the yogiis get bliss.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Who can we call a yogi? <I>Sam&#x301;yogo yoga ituktyah jiiva&#x301;tma&#x301; parama&#x301;tmanah</I>. One who merges his or her individual entity into the Supreme Entity, little &ldquo;I&rdquo; into the big &ldquo;I&rdquo;, unit consciousness into supreme consciousness, is a yogi. Such yogis do not get bliss from anything else, other than <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I>, because to such a person <I>na&#x301;lpe sukhamasti bhu&#x301;maeva sukham</I> &ndash; He or she is not satisfied with a little, a bit; he or she wants more, more and more. Where does this wanting more end? When one attains the infinite, and not before.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Due to His endlessness the Lord is dear to one, because one wants to attain Him in such a way that this attainment has no end. Finite objects have a beginning and an end, hence after their end there is pain. One who loves to eat <I>rasogolla&#x301;</I> experiences pleasure as long as the <I>rasogolla&#x301;</I> remains in his mouth, not once it has disappeared down his throat. So one gets his pleasure from something which has no end, something which is beginningless and endless; for this reason the yogiis find their happiness in <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I>. So the word &ldquo;Ra&#x301;ma&rdquo; <I></I>means <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph --><I>Ra&#x301;ma</I> &ndash; <I>ra&#x301;</I> plus <I>ma</I>. What do intellectuals say about the meaning of this word <I>ra&#x301;</I>? <I>Ra&#x301;ti mahiidharah Ra&#x301;mah</I>. Of all entities in this universe &ldquo;Ra&#x301;ma&rdquo; <I></I>is the most luminous. Smaller entities are illuminated by larger ones. Planets and satellites are illuminated by sun. The sun receives its energy from various nebulae and from cosmic light and heat. The entity with whose help the various objects are manifested and illuminated is &ldquo;Ra&#x301;ma&rdquo;. The first letter of the word <I>ra&#x301;ti</I> [luminous] <I></I>is <I>ra&#x301;</I>, and the initial letter of the word <I>mahiidharah</I> [universe] <I></I>is <I>ma</I>. <I>Ra&#x301; </I>and <I>ma</I> makes <I>Ra&#x301;mah &#151; ra&#x301;ti mahiidharah Ra&#x301;mah</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->What is the most luminous? The small atomic structure that we see in this universe is of fundamental importance. Electrons revolve around its nucleus, so the heart of the atomic structure is its nucleus. Similarly, as with our planetary system, all the planetary systems of the universe have, as their nucleus, a particular star and the respective planets revolve around it. In the same way, the heart of this universe is the <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I>, the <I>Purus&#x301;ottama</I>. Animate or inanimate, all revolve around him, thus he is the source of all inspiration, the source of all light; he is the most luminous entity. <I>Ra&#x301;ti mahiidharah Ra&#x301;mah</I>. Hence the meaning of <I>ra&#x301;ti mahiidharah</I> or the word Ra&#x301;ma <I></I>is <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I>. Different explanations bring us back to the same entity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Then there is <I>Ra&#x301;van&#x301;asya maran&#x301;am&#x301; Ra&#x301;mah</I>. The first letter of the word <I>Ra&#x301;van&#x301;asya</I> [of <I>Ra&#x301;van&#x301;a</I>] is <I>ra&#x301; </I>and the first letter of the word <I>maran&#x301;am&#x301;</I> [death] is <I>ma</I>. By combining them we get the word <I>Ra&#x301;ma</I>. What is <I>Ra&#x301;van&#x301;a</I>? <I>Rao + an&#x301; = Ra&#x301;van&#x301;a</I>. That mental flow which degrades a human being, which brings one to one&#146;s lowest point, which crudifies one&#146;s existence, is <I>Ra&#x301;van&#x301;a</I>, that is, depraved mental propensities, those which diminish one&#146;s humanity, which destroy a human being&#146;s existence.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->It is said that <I>Ra&#x301;van&#x301;a</I> is a demon. Certainly he is a demon because the force which degrades a person in this way is certainly not insignificant; it is a veritable demon, a <I>ra&#x301;ks&#x301;asa</I>. Who is this <I>Ra&#x301;van&#x301;a</I> for human beings? It is the depraved propensities of one&#146;s mind. They are the reason for a person&#146;s degradation. How do these depraved propensities of human beings function? They do so simultaneously in ten directions. North, south, east, west, up and down &#151; these six are called <I>pradish</I>; and southeast, northeast, northwest, southwest, these four corners, are called <I>anudish</I>. Six plus four equals ten. The depraved propensities of human beings function in these ten directions. So it is said that this tenfold depraved propensities, <I>Ra&#x301;van&#x301;a</I>, has ten heads &#151; <I>dasha&#x301;nana</I>. His depraved propensities function in ten directions. And what is necessary in order to destroy these depraved propensities, to annihilate them? <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I>&#146;s special grace is needed. A human being&#146;s own power is not sufficient. No matter how much they cry out, it won&#146;t do. As long as they do not take shelter in <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> they cannot gain deliverance from the clutches of that <I>Ra&#x301;van&#x301;a</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->This <I>Ra&#x301;van&#x301;a</I> functions within the human mind, within the state, within family, within society, everywhere. Human beings have to wage a ceaseless struggle against this <I>Ra&#x301;van&#x301;a</I>. There is no other way out. With the progress of civilization these <I>Ra&#x301;van&#x301;as</I> have been evolving more and more sophisticated ways to do great harm to human beings. In English I call them &ldquo;polished satans&rdquo;. It is easy to detect <I>Ra&#x301;van&#x301;a</I> in the form of <I>Ra&#x301;van&#x301;a</I> but it is difficult to recognize such polished satans as <I>Ra&#x301;van&#x301;a</I>. So human beings must be even more firmly prepared to fight against these kinds of demons.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="7..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->In order to appear in battle against this evil, this malevolent force, human beings will have to take the shelter of <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I>. Otherwise on their own human beings are helpless. They want to do great things but they are incapable of it. So they will have to resort to the shelter of <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I>. In order to kill this <I>Ra&#x301;van&#x301;a</I> the one whose shelter must be taken is <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> &ndash; <I>Ra&#x301;van&#x301;asya maran&#x301;am&#x301; Ra&#x301;mah</I>. The first letter of the word <I>maran&#x301;am</I> is <I>ma</I>. Combining the two we get Ra&#x301;ma, that is, whichever meaning we accept as the meaning of Ra&#x301;ma, it means <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Now let us take <I>Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a</I>. In Sanskrit the word <I>na&#x301;ra</I> has three meanings. One meaning is <I>niiram &#151; niram, udakam, pa&#x301;niiyam, jalam, kambalam, ka</I>. There are various names for water, among them <I>na&#x301;ra</I> is one. Another is <I>niira </I>and yet another is <I>ka</I>. <I>Ka</I> also means &ldquo;water&rdquo;. The land which is surrounded by water is called <I>kaccha</I> [in Gujarat state of India]. <I>Ka</I> is surrounded, thus <I>kaccha</I>. The leafy green vegetable <I>(sha&#x301;k)</I> that lies extended <I>(lambii)</I> on the surface of <I>ka</I> or water is <I>ka-lambii</I> or <I>kalamii sha&#x301;k</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph --><I>Na&#x301;ra</I> does not only mean &ldquo;water;&rdquo; another meaning is &ldquo;devotion&rdquo;. For example, he who distributes devotion, who gives devotion, is <I>na&#x301;rada</I>. <I>Da</I> means &ldquo;one who gives&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph --><I>Na&#x301;ra</I> also means <I>Parama&#x301; Prakrti</I>, the Cosmic Operative Principle. Now <I>Parama&#x301; Prakrti</I> does not remain in a void. Everything in this universe requires a support or container <I>(a&#x301;dha&#x301;ra)</I>. Right now I am in a particular place. And where is this place? It is in Bengal. Where is Bengal? It&#146;s in India. India is its support or container. The container of India is Asia and for Asia it is the earth. This earth&#146;s container is the solar system. Everyone requires some container. <I>Parama&#x301; Prakrti</I> also requires some container. No one can be without shelter. Only <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> is without shelter. He requires no shelter since He is the shelter of all. I have just mentioned that one name of <I>Parama&#x301; Prakrti</I> is <I>na&#x301;ra</I>. In Sanskrit <I>ayana</I> means &ldquo;shelter&rdquo; or &ldquo;holder&rdquo;. He who gives shelter to <I>na&#x301;ra</I> or <I>Parama&#x301; Prakrti</I> is <I>Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a</I>. Who is <I>Parama&#x301; Prakrti&#146;s</I> shelter? <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I>. Hence <I>Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a</I> means <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I>. In every case we are getting <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> and again <I>Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a</I> also means <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->A few days ago in a certain place I gave a talk about Hari. Hari means <I>harati pa&#x301;pan ityarthe harih</I>. In Sanskrit <I>haran&#x301;a</I> means &ldquo;theft&rdquo;. The thing is, in society we condemn someone who steals. In Ananda Marga it is considered to be in violation of <I>asteya</I> [non-stealing]. Even mentally it is not condoned. However, one who steals we call Hari. It is not a good thing. It is against the sixteen points, but the word Hari <I></I>means &ldquo;one who steals&rdquo;. What does He steal? He steals the sins of the devotee. The point is that his sons and daughters, his children, are very dear to <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I>. Children are dear to their father; it is quite natural. But not all of these children are equally well behaved. Human beings are characterized by their errors &ndash; &ldquo;To err is human.&rdquo; Now <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> is not simply a judge. There is a domestic relationship as well. It would not be proper if He only acted as an administrator. There is a relationship of love and affection with Him.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Now, his sons and daughters, today they are conscious and refrain from committing any sins, but in the past they committed many. How will they cope with this burden of sins? For some people this burden [of sins] is so heavy that they will have to take birth five hundred times more in order to lessen it. So, will <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> desire that His children carry this burden for five hundred more lives? Certainly not. Rather He will want them to be free, to have their burden lightened. So what should be done? What will he tell his children? He will tell them: &ldquo;Do one thing. From now on follow the right path. Give me the sins you have accumulated up until now. I will carry that burden.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Now the interesting thing is that the devotees also have a certain common sense. They have a sense of responsibility. They say: &ldquo;How can I give you my sins? We will give you delicacies to eat, we will worship you, we will sing your <I>kiirtana</I>, we will try to make you happy. But how can we give you our sins? What a terrible idea! We cannot, we will not give you our sins.&rdquo; But if they do not give Him their sins, then they will have to carry that burden for thousands of lives. He does not want His children to undergo so much suffering. Despite his son being a thief or dacoit, a father sees a lawyer in an effort to save him. It&#146;s the same situation. So what does He do? Since they will not give them openly, He steals the sins of His sons and daughters without their knowledge.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->You all know well, you have read in the second volume of <I>Varn&#x301;a Paricaya</I><!-- fn --><a name="Ref.7.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#7.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->, that taking other&#146;s things without their permission is theft. So He is also stealing. Of course, He is stealing for their good, but it is still theft. Since He is committing <I>haran&#x301;a</I>, <I></I>or stealing, one of His names is Hari. So whatever meaning of Ra&#x301;ma we accept, whatever meaning of <I>Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a</I> or <I>Hari</I> we accept, it refers to the one and the same <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I>. It is out of ignorance that human beings fight.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->Now the thing is that every human being will have to stick to one name [of <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I>], not innumerable names. Even though each name ends up being the same, they will have to take on one name only, not many, because they will have to become established in that name. For this reason human beings should never accept two names, only one &ndash; internally one name, externally one name, everywhere one name.

<a name="8..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph --><b>Manomaya&#x301;nanda</b>: <I>Manomaya + a&#x301;nanda</I>. Where does the word <I>manomaya</I> come from? The word <I>manomaya</I> is derived by adding the suffix <I>mayat&#x301;</I> to the root of the word <I>manah</I>. The suffix <I>mayat&#x301;</I> is attached to indicate &ldquo;that from which something is formed.&rdquo; It is not a verbal affix (primary suffix) but rather a nominal affix (secondary suffix), that is, it is affixed to nominal root, not the root verb. <I>Manah</I> is a word. For example, <I>daya&#x301; +mayat&#x301; = daya&#x301;maya</I>, which means &ldquo;that which is formed of compassion&rdquo;. <I>Krpa&#x301;maya</I> means &ldquo;that which is formed of grace&rdquo;. <I>Svarn&#x301;amaya</I> means &ldquo;that which is formed of gold&rdquo;. <I>Mrn&#x301;maya</I> means &ldquo;that which is formed of earth&rdquo;. <I>Cinmaya</I> means &ldquo;that which is formed of consciousness&rdquo;. So <I>manomaya</I> means &ldquo;that which is formed of mind&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Now a man has a body made of the five material factors. It has not been formed of mind, but that material body is operated by its mind. Mind is the director. So the body is not <I>manomaya</I>; it is material &ndash; <I>pa&#x301;in&#x32D;cabhu&#x301;tamaya</I>. But what is the case with <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I>? <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> is not <I>pa&#x301;in&#x32D;cabhu&#x301;tamaya</I> but rather <I>manomaya</I>. He has a mind and that mind is operated by <I>a&#x301;tma&#x301;</I> [consciousness]. Nothing takes place at all through any material body. If He ever came in a material body then that material body would have to remain within His mind. It cannot go outside Him, that is to say, in this case also He is <I>manomaya</I>, not <I>pa&#x301;in&#x32D;cabhu&#x301;tamaya</I>. He has created that material body within His mind, so He is <I>manomaya</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Now, whatever we see in this universe we call quinquelemental. Whatever we see in this material world is real to us in its quinquelemental form but to <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> it is not. He thinks in this way. He thinks the palm tree, He thinks the mountain. To us these are all quinquelemental but to Him they are psychic, completely psychic. Hence <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> is <I>manomaya</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->This <I>manomaya</I> entity is called <I>manomaya</I> for yet another reason; this being that <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> is present in every cavity of the human mind. In other words, there is no way I can hide anything from Him because He is all-pervading. He is present within everything. Everything has been created by his thought process. Your material body has also been created by His thought process, and He is within your mind. And this individual mind of yours, which is within your body as a result of clash and cohesion and also functions outside the body, has also been created by His mind. He is present within it and within your <I>a&#x301;tma&#x301;</I> as well. Hence He is <I>manomaya</I> both within your mind and outside it as well. There is no way for you to hide anything from him. &ldquo;Today I couldn&#146;t do this work, it should have been done last night. Today I won&#146;t go in front of Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; because who knows what will happen. If He says something in front of the others, I&#146;ll be cut to the quick. I won&#146;t go today; I&#146;ll go tomorrow.&rdquo; You have thought all these in your mind, but He who is <I>manomaya</I>, He hears everything. It is better not to think in this way. Such thoughts are not proper. Rather one should say: &ldquo;You know everything. Today I&#146;m a little scared, so I&#146;m not going.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->This is <I>manomaya</I>. The bliss that one derives by ideating on that <I>manomaya Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> cannot be gotten anyplace else. The name of that bliss is <I>manomaya&#x301;nanda</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph --><b>Jagadbha&#x301;saka&#x301;nanda</b>: In Sanskrit the word <I>jagat</I> is derived by adding the suffix <I>kvip</I> to the root verb <I>gam</I>. How does the suffix <I>kvip</I> function? For example, <I>mayat&#x301;</I>, meaning &ldquo;that from which something is formed,&rdquo; <I></I>is affixed to the verbal root, not the nominal root. With the word <I>jagat</I>, the suffix <I>kvip</I> is attached to the verbal root <I>gam</I>. <I>Kvip</I> is attached to the verbal root, the root verb, not the nominal root. What does the root verb <I>gam</I> mean? Here the suffix was used in the sense of &ldquo;nature&rdquo;, that is, &ldquo;to show the nature of&rdquo;. For example, adding the suffix <I>kvip</I> to the root verb <I>s&#x301;ad</I> prefixed by <I>upa</I> and <I>ni</I> yields <I>upanis&#x301;ad</I>. <I>Upa</I> means &ldquo;near&rdquo;; <I>ni</I> means &ldquo;deeply&rdquo;. That which brings a human being profoundly near to <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> is <I>upanis&#x301;ad</I>. The suffix <I>kvip</I> has been used and meaning of it, is &ndash; &ldquo;To bring near is its nature.&rdquo; The root verb <I>gam</I> and the suffix <I>kvip</I> form the word <I>jagat</I>. <I>Gam</I> means &ldquo;to move&rdquo; and that whose nature is to move we call <I>jagat</I>. Therefore the suffix <I>kvip</I> has been used.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Everything on this earth is moving. Movement is its nature, it is a sign of advancement. There is no way, no scope, for anyone to stop. It cannot happen. A dead body also cannot stop, because it is on this earth. The earth revolves, it moves continuously. Whatever has been created in this universe, whatever is begotten by the imagination of <I>manomaya</I>, is moving. It is <I>jagat</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->The word <I>bha&#x301;saka</I> comes by adding the suffix <I>s&#x301;ak</I> or the suffix <I>n&#x301;ak</I> to the root verb <I>bha&#x301;s</I>. Let me say something about the suffixes <I>s&#x301;ak</I> and <I>n&#x301;ak</I>. In order to accomplish some work, there is often the need of two entities. One is a person and the other the object this person uses in order to do the work. Imagine that someone is making an earthen jar. Who is the maker of the jar? The person, of course, and the earth as well. The suffix <I>n&#x301;ak</I> is attached to the root of the earth. The suffix <I>s&#x301;ak</I> is attached to the root of the man who is making it, and the suffix <I>n&#x301;ak</I> is added to the root of the object or the element with whose help something is made.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Let us say, for example, that something is being dyed. For example, some cloth is being stained with a dye. Here there are two things. There is the person who is applying the dye, and there is the dye which has been bought in the market. The pigment is <I>rain&#x32D;jak </I>&ndash; <I>rain&#x32D;jak sa&#x301;va&#x301;n</I> [dying soap] &ndash; formed by adding the suffix <I>n&#x301;ak</I> to the root verb <I>ran&#x301;j</I>, and the man who is applying the dye we call <I>rajaka</I>, by adding the suffix <I>s&#x301;ak </I>to the root verb <I>ran&#x301;j</I>. In Bengali the word <I>rajaka</I> is used to mean <I>dhopa&#x301;</I> [washerman] because in the olden days the washermen used to dye clothes. The actual meaning of the word <I>rajaka</I> is &ldquo;a person who applies dye&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Now the meaning of the root verb <I>bha&#x301;s</I> is &ldquo;to illuminate&rdquo;, &ldquo;to make radiant&rdquo;. He who has coloured the entire world &ndash; since it is coloured we are able to see it &ndash; he is <I>bha&#x301;saka</I>. So <I>jagadbha&#x301;saka</I> means we are able to see the universe. Why? Because He has made it shine, has made it radiant. Everything shines with His light, so He is <I>jagadbha&#x301;sa</I>. <I>Jagadbha&#x301;saka</I> and <I>jagadbha&#x301;sa</I> &ndash; both work &ndash; by adding the suffix <I>al</I>. One who knows this is a spiritual aspirant. He is that <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> who is <I>manomaya</I>. So one will ideate on Him, will meditate on Him, will repeat His <I>japa</I> [repetition of mantra], will come close to Him, will heed His instructions. And what is that bliss that one gets by being absorbed in the thought of Him? It is <I>jagadbha&#x301;saka&#x301;nanda</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph --><I>A</I> prefix, <I>nand</I> root verb + <I>al</I> suffix = <I>a&#x301;nanda</I>. This <I>a&#x301;nanda</I> gives a human being unlimited pleasure. No object gives a human being endless pleasure. For example, a <I>sandesh</I> [a type of milk sweet] gives pleasure as long as it is on the tongue, but once it is has been swallowed the <I>sandesh</I> comes to an end. But the type of pleasure we get from something that gives us endless pleasure is called <I>a&#x301;nanda</I>. The <I>a&#x301;nanda</I> or bliss that we get by ideating on <I>jagadbha&#x301;saka</I>, that pleasure which has no end, is <I>jagadbha&#x301;saka&#x301;nanda</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph --><b>Krs&#x301;n&#x301;aprema&#x301;nanda</b>: In Sanskrit the root verb <I>krs&#x301;</I> means &ldquo;to culture&rdquo;, &ldquo;to cultivate&rdquo;, &ldquo;to till the land&rdquo;. This root verb has another meaning as well: &ldquo;to pull&rdquo; or &ldquo;to attract&rdquo;. <I>A&#x301; &ndash; krs&#x301; + anat&#x301; = a&#x301;kars&#x301;an&#x301;a</I> [attraction]. Another meaning of the root verb <I>krs&#x301;</I> is the thought of &ldquo;I exist.&rdquo; Everyone thinks &ldquo;I exist&rdquo;. &ldquo;I am coming from New Barrackpore.&rdquo; &ldquo;I am going to the <I>ja&#x301;grti</I>.&rdquo; It is only after the thought of &ldquo;I exist&rdquo; that a person thinks of anything else. This sense of &ldquo;I exist&rdquo; is within everyone. Thinking of this &ldquo;I exist&rdquo;, this action, we call <I>krs&#x301;</I>. We don&#146;t think, &ldquo;I don&#146;t exist;&rdquo; we think &ldquo;I exist&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Now the word Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a <I></I>is derived by adding the suffix <I>na</I> to the root verb <I>krs&#x301;</I>. The word Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a <I></I>means &ldquo;he who attracts everyone, whether we know it or not&rdquo;. Knowingly or unknowingly, everything is being attracted, is being drawn towards him. That attraction is irresistible. It is no use saying that we won&#146;t be moved by that attraction. We will have to rush towards him because Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a <I></I>draws the mind and draws the legs also. If the feet say they won&#146;t go, the mind will say that it has to go. And if the mind says that it won&#146;t go, the feet will drag it in his direction, even if it does not want to come. Another meaning of the word Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a <I></I>is &ldquo;nucleus of the universe&rdquo;. Sitting at the very center he attracts or draws everything.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->The second meaning of the word Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a <I></I>is &ldquo;the colour black.&rdquo; Of all colours in this world, people&#146;s sight is first drawn to the colour black. In this sense the colour black is called Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, that is, it attracts.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Every human being thinks &ldquo;I exist, I exist,&rdquo; but they can only think &ldquo;I exist&rdquo; when <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> gives them the mental force to think it. If He would not give them that mental force then the thought &ldquo;I exist&rdquo; would not be thought. Bricks, stones and wood do not think, are not able to think, &ldquo;I exist&rdquo;. But living beings think this, especially human beings. The name of the one who supplies the force behind this thought of &ldquo;I exist,&rdquo; that is, I exist because He exists, is Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Now the topic is <I>Krs&#x301;n&#x301;aprema</I>. Attraction is the law of nature, not repulsion. We may say that repulsion is negative attraction, but attraction is not negative repulsion. So attraction is the chief characteristic.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Say, for instance, a person is attracted to <I>sandesh</I>. <I>Sandesh</I> is something limited, so we cannot call this attraction <I>prema</I> . That attraction is a kind of mental weakness. However, when that attraction rushes towards the unlimited, that is, rushes in the direction of Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, then we call it <I>prema</I>. It means mental and physical propulsion for that universal nucleus. When we feel attracted towards that nucleus, that Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a<I></I>, whether it be mentally or physically, to the extent that we cannot resist, even if we wanted to, then it is called <I>Krs&#x301;n&#x301;aprema</I>. I cannot resist drinking liquor so I rush towards the liquor store &ndash; this is a limited thing. We call it <I>a&#x301;sakti</I> [attachment, addiction]. <I>Pa&#x301;na&#x301;sakti, madya&#x301;sakti </I>[intemperance] &ndash; these are all <I>a&#x301;sakti</I>, not <I>prema</I>. The bliss that lies behind this willingly or unwillingly rushing towards the Supreme is called <I>Krs&#x301;n&#x301;aprema</I>.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="9..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->One of these is <I>Su</I> which means <I>bha&#x301;la</I> [good] &ndash; this word comes from the Sanskrit word <I>bhadra</I>. When <I>bha&#x301;la</I> refers to &ldquo;physically good&rdquo; then the Sanskrit word for this is <I>accha</I>. <I>Su + accha = svaccha</I> &ndash; <I>svaccha jal</I> [pure water]. From <I>accha</I> comes the modern Hindi <I>a&#x301;ccha&#x301; </I>&ndash; <I>a&#x301;ccha&#x301;-acchii-acche</I>. <I>Accha&#x301;</I> means &ldquo;physically good&rdquo;, good in the sense of when it is a qualification.

Mantra <I></I>is that by which, when it is ideated upon, one obtains the path of liberation. <I>Manana kara&#x301;</I> means &ldquo;to think&rdquo;. The mind has two functions &ndash; to think and to remember. <I>Mana + trae + d&#x301;a</I>. Adding the suffix <I>d&#x301;a</I> to the root verb <I>trae</I> gives <I>tra</I>.

The <I>brahmabiija</I> [acoustic root of Supreme Consciousness]. The <I>brahmabiija</I> is the best acoustic root <I></I>because the universe is produced from it. Of all the sounds that exist, of all the acoustic roots, the most powerful acoustic root, the most powerful mantra is the <I>brahmabiija</I>. Thus <I>sumantra</I> means <I>brahmamantra, brahmabiija</I>. The bliss that one derives with the help of this <I>sumantra</I> or <I>brahmabiija</I> is called <I>sumantrananda</I>.<!-- /block --></p>

When a person is overcome by something &ndash; be it anxiety or disease, physical or mental illness &ndash; that distressed person, neglected person, troubled person, looks to others for sympathy. When you are in a normal state then it is fine if no one is close by, but if you are distressed or overcome by grief then you will want at least one or two persons to be with you. In times of happiness &ndash; say, for example, you receive some good news &ndash; what will your mind like to do? &ldquo;Let me tell him; let me tell her. Let me call him; let me call her.&rdquo; Don&#146;t you do this? Of course, you do. Similarly, if you eat something tasty, it feels good afterwards. Then you feel like telling everyone how good it was. The norm is that when a person feels some happiness they want to tell others about it, because at that moment they are overcome by that happiness, they are <I>sukha&#x301;rta</I>. In the same way, when someone is in distress they cry and moan and say: &ldquo;O, look what happened to me.&rdquo; They want to call others and tell them about it. This is the norm.<!-- /block --></p>

But when misfortune strikes they wail and moan: &ldquo;This is what you had in store for me, Lord? This is your judgment?&rdquo; For an afflicted person there is only one ally and that is the Lord. When everyone else has rejected or abandoned them, when they have no one else to turn to, they call on <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I>.

<div class=book_chapter_info_top></div>

<a name="10..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Often a question arises in the minds of human beings as to whether there exists any discrimination in the right to liberation or salvation. It is an old question and a complex one. There are some few &ndash; why a few &ndash; there are many people of great influence and esteem spread all around the earth who put forth various reasons and fallacious arguments to try and prove why only certain people can get liberation or salvation and the rest cannot. For example, the so-called low caste people cannot get liberation or salvation, or women cannot get liberation or salvation. Such are their ideas.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->These ideas are groundless. Behind them there is that age-old psycho-economic exploitation. They first exploit people in the psychic sphere, then in the socio-economic and other spheres of life. Many books have been written in abstruse language putting forth such fallacious arguments. Some are written in Hebrew, some in Sanskrit, and the common people are unable to understand them. Quoting these books, they claim that low caste people or women have no right to liberation or salvation but there is no clear proof that this is true. The thing is, I fail to understand what they mean by &ldquo;low caste people&rdquo;. If everyone in this world belongs to <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I>, if all are children of the Supreme Father, then where does the question of high caste or low-caste arise? Those who acknowledge the Supreme Father cannot make caste discriminations among his children. One father has five children; they cannot have five different castes. Hence one who acknowledges the Supreme Father does not acknowledge caste distinction, and one who acknowledges caste distinction does not acknowledge the Supreme Father, the Lord. Since one who accepts caste distinction does not accept the Lord, all this trickery is nothing but an artifice for deceiving and exploiting the people. There is nothing else behind it.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Women&#146;s rights have also been taken away in this way. &ldquo;This cannot be done. That cannot be done.&rdquo; If women do this they will be disgraced, but if men do the same thing they won&#146;t be. What kind of nonsense is this? The same rule applies to everyone. If men are the sons of <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> then women are his daughters and they have equal rights, otherwise it is injustice. A father takes his little daughter onto his lap and caresses her in the same way that he does his little son. He does not harbor any thought in his mind that he won&#146;t caress her because she is a girl. Hence those who say that women do not have a right to liberation or salvation are opportunists. They are exploiters of society. They are wicked people, evildoers.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->In the Tantras, Pa&#x301;rvatii asks if there is any discrimination in the right to liberation or salvation. It is true that among the various paths of sadhana, among the various paths accepted by Tantra, some are easy and some are difficult. Among these are the <I>daks&#x301;in&#x301;a&#x301;ca&#x301;ra</I> [right-hand path], <I>va&#x301;ma&#x301;ca&#x301;ra </I>[left-hand path], <I>madhyama&#x301;ca&#x301;ra</I> [middle path], <I>viira&#x301;ca&#x301;ra</I> [path of the brave], and <I>divya&#x301;ca&#x301;ra</I> [path of the godly]. These are not for everyone. For the well educated there may be one practice and for the very courageous another. One way is prescribed for the gentle-minded and another for the courageous. Some practices are common to all, for example <I>kiirtana</I>. In the process of sadhana, there may be some greater or lesser differences. However, as regards the attainment of liberation or salvation no discrimination or differentiation can be made. Everyone can attain liberation or salvation. Thus Shiva has said to <I>Pa&#x301;rvatii</I>:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..5"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->A&#x301;tmajin&#x32D;a&#x301;namidam&#x301; devi param&#x301; moks&#x301;aekasa&#x301;dhanam;<br>Sukrtaerma&#x301;navo bhu&#x301;tva&#x301; jin&#x32D;a&#x301;niicenmoks&#x301;ama&#x301;pnuya&#x301;t.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..6"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->[Self-knowledge, Pa&#x301;rvatii, is the greatest means to attain salvation. People are born as human beings due to their past good <I>sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras</I>, but to attain non-qualified liberation they will have to attain self-knowledge.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->In actuality, whatever the type of sadhana, when a person achieves self-knowledge then they realize that their path to salvation lies in their sadhana. When a unit being obtains a human body as a result of efforts from life to life, they become fit for attaining liberation with the help of this kind of self-knowledge. Hence herein lies the proof that one who has obtained a human body is suitable for attaining liberation or salvation. Here the question of discrimination of rights does not arise, nor does the question of caste. The question of any difference in intellect or learning does not come into play. One will have to have a human body and one will have to put it to work. One who has obtained a human body but who does not put it to work, who is not committed to spiritual practices, is inferior to an animal. That person is inferior to an animal for the reason that an animal does not know how sadhana is to be done, how one is to move towards Parama Purus&#x301;a. For this reason it does not do sadhana. But if a human knowingly does not do sadhana then he or she sins consciously. He or she is inferior to an animal.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="10..9"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->[I came to the world to worship Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, but I have become bound by illusion and become like a tree.]<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="10..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Now what is this self-knowledge through which a human being can attain liberation or salvation? What is knowledge <I>(jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na)</I>? The word <I>jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na</I> is a late Vedic word, not an Old Vedic word. In Old Vedic the root verb <I>vid</I> was used to mean &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo;, from which comes the word <I>Veda</I>. <I>Veda</I> means &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo;. In later times the Vedic word was <I>jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nam</I>. The Old Vedic root verb <I>jin&#x32D;a&#x301;</I> became the root verb <I>keno</I> in Old Latin and from the Old Latin word <I>keno</I> comes the modern English word &ldquo;know.&rdquo; Although the &ldquo;k&rdquo; is now silent, it is written since it comes from the original <I>keno</I>. What is the meaning of the root verb <I>jin&#x32D;a&#x301;</I>, of the verb &ldquo;to know&rdquo;? Subjectivization of external objectivity or external physicality. What is this subjectivization? The knower is the subject and the known is the object, and when this object is transmuted into the subject, i.e., when the object becomes one with the subject, then we may say, that is the process of knowing or knowledge. Now the object is reflected in the psychic sphere. Whether this subjectivization be internal projection or external projection, the process of mentally conceiving an external object in the psychic sphere and making it one&#146;s own is the act of knowing; the act of knowledge has taken place. But the <I>a&#x301;tma&#x301;</I> is not an external object, so how can the question of subjectivising it arises? I am not getting it from outside, so what is this self-knowledge? There are overblown discussions about self-knowledge in many places in many scriptures, but none of them have taken the time to explain clearly what it actually is.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..12"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->A&#x301;tmajin&#x32D;a&#x301;nam&#x301; vidurjin&#x32D;a&#x301;nam&#x301; jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nanyanya&#x301;ni ya&#x301;ni tu;<br>Ta&#x301;ni jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na&#x301;vabha&#x301;sa&#x301;ni sa&#x301;rasya naeva bodhana&#x301;t.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..13"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->[Self-knowledge is the real knowledge &ndash; all other knowledge is a mere shadow of knowledge; and will not lead to realization of the truth.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->It is said that the knowledge of any object other than <I>a&#x301;tma</I> [consciousness, soul] is not knowledge but rather the semblance of knowledge. For example, a shadow has two parts, the umbra and penumbra. Similarly, apart from the knowledge of Brahma, the knowledge of anything else is the umbra and penumbra of knowledge, because that reflection, assimilation or subjectivization takes place in the mental sphere, not in the <I>a&#x301;tmik</I> sphere. Hence self-knowledge is that knowledge which is contained within oneself, which does not come from outside. The awareness of that sense of existence which is contained within oneself, is self-knowledge. And that special kind of awareness of this internal sense of existence is as much true for the collective as it is for the individual or the unit. It is as much true for the <I>pratyaga&#x301;tma&#x301;</I><B><!-- fn --><a name="Ref.10.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#10.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> </B>as it is for the unit self <I>(jiiva&#x301;tma&#x301;)</I>, and in the case of the Cognitive Faculty as well. This self-knowledge is knowledge. The rest is not knowledge; it is the refuge of knowledge, because no other knowledge is complete or perfect.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Say, for instance, a certain gentleman resides in Midnapore. If he says that he is an authority in geography or that he knows geography very well, and I ask him, &ldquo;Okay sir, then please tell me how many anthills there are in Midnapore,&rdquo; he won&#146;t be able to answer me. If I ask him how many bricks there are in the city of Midnapore he won&#146;t be able to answer me either, because this kind of knowledge is not complete under any circumstances. Shiva has said: <I>a&#x301;tmajin&#x32D;a&#x301;namidam&#x301; devi param&#x301; moks&#x301;aekasa&#x301;-dhanam</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Where there is no scope for a second entity then it is self-knowledge. This self-knowledge paves the path to salvation. So what is necessary in order to cultivate or pursue or attain this self-knowledge for the attainment of salvation? Nothing more than a human body. And the attainment of salvation has nothing to do with whatever caste has been branded on that human body, nor with whether it is male or female. Nor does it have anything to do with whether one is learned or unlearned.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph --><I>Sukrtaerma&#x301;navo bhu&#x301;tva&#x301; jin&#x32D;a&#x301;niicenmoks&#x301;ama&#x301;pnuya&#x301;t</I> . <I>Sukrtaeah:</I> Whereas in Laokik Sanskrit the word <I>sva</I> is used to mean &ldquo;self&rdquo;, in Vedic Sanskrit the word <I>su</I> is used in the same sense. <I>Rtam&#x301; pivantao sukrtasya loke</I>. Here <I>sukrtasya</I> means <I>svakrtasya</I> [self created]. <I>Sukrtaerma&#x301;navo bhu&#x301;tva</I> &ndash; when a living being attains a human body by dint of their actions, actional faculty, efforts and the proper completion of their actions, then they are able to acquire self-knowledge. For the acquisition of this self-knowledge, the guru will give instructions how to proceed. The guru will teach them and provide the philosophy necessary to guide them in their forward movements. And that has been provided. If a human being is to walk this path, then this philosophy must make provisions for how to maintain adjustment with the society, and that has been provided. If only a spiritual philosophy is given and not a socio-economic philosophy, then the human being will have to suffer innumerable afflictions in the social and economic spheres. One will have to move ahead while facing countless oppressions and under the pressure of such circumstances, they may fall from the spiritual path. Thus, just as there is the need of a spiritual philosophy in order to create a strong society and a strong and well-knit community of spiritual aspirants, there is even more need for strong socio-economic philosophy. Without it, equilibrium cannot be maintained. You won&#146;t be able to maintain your socio-economico-psychic equilibrium or equipoise. You require it. It is a must for living beings.<!-- /block --></p>

In this way one who acquires knowledge attains liberation or salvation. Now many may think that knowledge is something for the pandits. This is absolutely not so. The knowledge of the pandits is a confusing mess; it is hardly worth anything.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="10..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->The word <I>pan&#x301;d&#x301;ita</I> comes from <I>pan&#x301;d&#x301;a</I> meaning &ldquo;realization resplendent with knowledge&rdquo;. <I>Aham&#x301; brahma&#x301;smiiti sa&#x301; buddhi pan&#x301;d&#x301;a&#x301; iti ucyate</I> [the realization of &ldquo;I am Brahma&rdquo; is known as <I>pan&#x301;d&#x301;a&#x301;</I>]. In Bengali there is also a surname <I>Pan&#x301;d&#x301;a&#x301;</I>. People mistakenly say <I>Pa&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;a&#x301;</I>, but it is not <I>Pa&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;a&#x301;</I> but rather <I>Pan&#x301;d&#x301;a&#x301;</I>. One who is established in the knowledge of that realization of &ldquo;I am Brahma&rdquo; is <I>pan&#x301;d&#x301;ita</I>. One who desires to attain that knowledge is <I>pa&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;eya</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->It is said that there are how many hundreds of scriptures and that these scriptures are like the ocean. When these many scriptures are churned, what is obtained? For example, when milk is churned, butter is obtained and the buttermilk remains on the bottom. Similarly, when the ocean of scriptures is churned then the essence, the butter or knowledge, floats to the top. And those who are devotees, who are spiritual aspirants, who want <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> and nothing else, they eat this butter, while the pandits die arguing. When they finally come around to eating, they find that the devotees have eaten all the butter and left only the buttermilk. Then they argue and debate about the buttermilk for a few days and when they go to drink it they find that it is spoiled. That is the defect of the pandits. This &ldquo;there is nothing that I don&#146;t know&rdquo; attitude, this know-it-all psychology, is the greatest disease of the pandits. As long as this disease is present it is impossible to attain self-knowledge, because as long as mental equilibrium is not present, self-knowledge is not and cannot be obtained.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->How can an ordinary person attain this self-knowledge? What is the path to its attainment? The mind should be apexed. The mind should be pinnacled and directed towards the one. Then one does not take notice of any obstacles in the path; one must not. That one-pointed ideation rushes towards one&#146;s <I>is&#x301;t&#x301;a</I>, towards one&#146;s beloved<I>.

<a name="10..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->For this the mind will have to be made one-pointed through sadhana, and the best means for achieving one-pointedness is <I>kiirtana</I>. <I>Kiirtaniiya&#x301; sada&#x301; harih</I>. Human beings should always do the <I>kiirtana</I> of the Lord. When one does <I>kiirtana</I> the mind becomes one-pointed within a short time. Then one sits for sadhana and while sitting there is progress, the mind becomes spotless, everything is gained. The human being will have to rush towards <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I>. Nobody can become a <I>jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nii</I> by reading books. A person earns real knowledge by rushing towards <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> and coming into his close proximity, and one who earns this real knowledge attains liberation or salvation. For this, one who does not know their abc&#146;s will make it, and one who has an MA in 700 languages will not make it. This is a different world, a different matter altogether. An intelligent person, therefore, will move forward single-mindedly on the path of sadhana, and in order to prepare his mind for sadhana that person will certainly do a little <I>kiirtana</I>. I have said this before in several places and I am saying it again: <I>kiirtaniiyah sada&#x301; harih</I>, that is, one must do the <I>kiirtana</I> of the Lord, the <I>kiirtana</I> of <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I>. And why must one do the <I>kiirtana</I> of <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I>? Because one of his names is <I>Hari. Hari</I> means: <I>harati pa&#x301;pam&#x301; ityarthe harih</I>, that is, he who steals the sins of the unit being is <I>Hari</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->Now you may say that non-stealing <I>(asteya)</I> is one of our moral precepts. <I>Asteya</I> means &ldquo;non-stealing&rdquo;. So <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> steals? What a thing! Fie, fie, fie, this is not good at all. It is against Yama-Niyama, against the Sixteen Points. This is very bad. Actually it is bad, but the Lord faces some inconvenience and it behooves all of you to properly consider that inconvenience and then say whether or not he is following Yama-Niyama or the Sixteen Points. What happens is that every living being is extremely dear to the Lord because everyone is His progeny, progeny of the Supreme Father, of <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I>. Whether they are saint or sinner, both are His progeny. The sinner who is up to their ears in the mire of hell is also His progeny. He is also not insignificant to Him. If He will tell him &ldquo;get out of my sight,&rdquo; then that sinner will tell Him: &ldquo;I will get out of Your sight then, but tell me where should I go since there is nothing outside You. Everything is within You. So if You tell me to go outside You, then it means there is some place outside You where You are telling me to go. If such a place exists then You are not endless. You are not the Lord. So change Your name. But if you let me stay then it is okay, there is no need to change Your name. So it is Your duty to uplift me, to show me the path to liberation and salvation. I am Your child, so this is my right.&rdquo; Every human being can claim this right from him.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->Now <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> wants every human being to attain liberation or salvation. Why would He want any daughter or son of Him to carry forever the burden of their sins. He certainly does not want that. There are many on this earth for whom one life would not be enough to discharge their sins. Fifteen or twenty lives would be required to put an end to them. However <I>Hari</I> or <I>Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a</I> is <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I>, so He will certainly not want His dear sons and daughter to carry the burden of their sins life after life. So what will He do? He will say: &ldquo;Do one thing, give me all your sins. Give me the burden of your sins. Lighten your load and move ahead. I will carry the burden of your sins.&rdquo; But the devotee will say: &ldquo;What is this, Lord! Why should you carry the burden of my sins? Have I nothing else to give that I will give you my sins? Why should I give them? I will cook delicious food for you, I will sing for you, I will dance <I>kiirtana</I> for you, I will make you happy. Instead of all that I should give you my sins? This cannot be. It simply cannot be.&rdquo; But <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> wants his sons and daughters to be liberated from the burden of their sins. Still they won&#146;t give them to him. So what does He do, He steals their sins secretly, thus He is a thief, He is Hari. He has no other means but to take them secretly. But to take someone else&#146;s belongings without saying is stealing. So this is stealing. For this reason, <I>harati pa&#x301;pam&#x301; yah sah harih</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->Bear in mind that this Hari, this <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I>, loves you so much that if you do His <I>kiirtana</I> with full concentration, with single-mindedness, then the mind becomes one-pointed. If in that state you do sadhana properly, then you will surely progress. Thus Shiva told <I>Pa&#x301;rvatii</I>: <I>Sukrtaerma&#x301;navo bhu&#x301;tva&#x301; jin&#x32D;a&#x301;niicenmoks&#x301;ama&#x301;pnuya&#x301;t</I>.<!-- /block --></p>

The fourth is equanimity of mind. The fifth is control of the senses. The sixth is a balanced diet. The seventh &ndash; there is no seventh requirement.]<!-- /block --></p>

It makes little difference to me. Wise people will never withdraw from the path of ideology, the path which they accept as their ideal.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..10"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;If I set out to do some work, believing it to be just and proper, and if the pandits or the moral crusaders abuse me, then let them. I won&#146;t let it sway me.&rdquo; I don&#146;t depend on the pandits, because in most cases, though not all, the pandits are lazy, indolent fellows. They cannot work, they lack courage and practical intellect; indeed, they are mostly parasites. <I>Pan&#x301;d&#x301;ita&#x301;h-vanita&#x301;h-lata&#x301;h</I> , that is, pandits, women and creepers need some support with which to grow. I do not want such a thing, so I do not depend on the pandits. As regards <I>vanita&#x301;</I>, or women, our girls are committed to standing on their own feet, and I hope that they will very quickly do so. The conception exists that women are dependent on others. It is my firm conviction that they will disprove this contention.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->The pandits &ndash; I have just said that they are lazy, indolent fellows &ndash; let them abuse me; it won&#146;t sway me. Rather I won&#146;t even bother to listen to them. I do not have the time. I won&#146;t listen to their abuse for even a moment. And if they praise me I do not have the time to listen to that either. I have work to do. I have a goal to reach. And if, as a result of my work, Laks&#x301;mii, the goddess of wealth, comes and remains in my house, then well and good. But if she does not then it does not matter. My Prout philosophy does not support capitalism, so we do not go begging for the grace of Laks&#x301;mii. Moreover, the people of today have come to understand what the people of yesteryear did not, that Laks&#x301;mii is bound to reside in the houses of sinners. Can anyone get rich without resorting to some sort of thievery? Not at all, which means that you&#146;ll find sin wherever you find Laks&#x301;mii. If Laks&#x301;mii wants to remain in my house then she is welcome; it makes no difference. If she wants to go, then she can go. I have no objection.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Now there is that story of the king. Once there was a very righteous <I>(dha&#x301;rmika)</I> king. He said, &ldquo;let me establish a market,&rdquo; but since there was not much buying and selling in that area, hardly anyone used to come to sell their wares. There were no customers. Then the king said: &ldquo;Okay, whatever goods are not purchased by sunset, I will purchase them myself.&rdquo; Then the vendors began to come. One day someone brought an image of the goddess of misfortune. Now who would buy the goddess of misfortune, who would keep her in their house? So no one bought it. Then the fellow went to the king and reminded him that he had promised to buy whatever was not sold, so kindly buy this.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->The king replied &ldquo;certainly,&rdquo; and he bought it. That night, when the king lay down to sleep, he heard a sound as if someone was weeping, some lady. The king got up to search. He asked who was there and found a woman weeping.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; he asked.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;I am the goddess Laks&#x301;mii of your kingdom,&rdquo; came the reply.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Why are you crying so late at night? What is the matter?&rdquo; the king asked.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;You let the goddess of misfortune into this house. I can no longer stay here. How can I, the goddess of fortune, remain in the same place with the goddess of misfortune?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->The king said: &ldquo;Look, I gave my word that I would buy whatever was not sold. I am bound to the honour of my word, so I bought it. If that is to your liking then good, but if it is not then that is fine as well. As you wish.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->Laks&#x301;mii left. A short while later the king heard another sound, the clacking of shoes. The king went to check and saw a regal personage leaving.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; the king asked.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;I am Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a,&rdquo; came the answer.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;What would you like to say?&rdquo; the king asked.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Laks&#x301;mii has left, so I am also leaving,&rdquo; Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a replied.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Okay, do whatever you think right,&rdquo; said the king.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->In this way the major and minor gods and goddesses left one by one.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; said the king. &ldquo;Do whatever you think right. Dharma is with me. I gave my word that I would buy it and I bought it.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->Finally at the end the god Dharma was leaving. The king asked, &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;I am the god Dharma.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Why are you leaving?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;All the other gods and goddesses have left. How can I remain?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;No, that won&#146;t do,&rdquo; said the king. &ldquo;I underwent so much just to preserve dharma and now you will also leave? What is this! This has all been done for your sake, so you cannot leave.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Yes, you are right,&rdquo; Dharma replied.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->Dharma stayed and afterwards the other gods and goddesses began to return one by one. The king had the gates locked but some were able to get through the gates, others through the ventilation shaft and still others through the skylight. They all said: &ldquo;I also want to come back, I also want to come back.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;If you wish to come, then come,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;and if you do not, then do not. I do not care.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->Finally Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a also returned. &ldquo;Ah, Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a, what do you want?&rdquo; said the king.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..36"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;When all the gods and goddesses have come, how can I stay away?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..37"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=37 type=paragraph -->Then the king noticed a woman coming, her face covered by a veil. The king understood that she was Laks&#x301;mii. In order not to embarrass her, the king did not ask who she was, but Laks&#x301;mii crept back into the house, her face covered with shame.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..38"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=38 type=paragraph -->That is the story. A <I>dha&#x301;rmik</I> person does not care for what others say; he or she is not afraid of anyone. Whether Laks&#x301;mii stays or goes wherever she likes, it does not matter at all. Dharma is with the <I>dha&#x301;rmik</I>. <I>Dharmam&#x301; raks&#x301;ati raks&#x301;itah</I>. One who protects dharma is also protected by dharma. One who is on the true path does not bother about any other direction; he or she does not even think about it. And they will not leave the path that they have chosen as their life&#146;s ideology for anything. If they have to die today as a result of taking that path, or if they have to die after endless time, let it be. It does not matter. Death will come one day &ndash; <I>ja&#x301;tasya hi dhruvormrtyuh</I>. One who is born must surely die, today, tomorrow or the next day, one day or another. To curl up and lie down out of fear that death will come is the epitome of foolishness. Such a person cannot accomplish any great work. One should always remain ready for death. Human beings should always remain ready.<!-- /block --></p>

I must have <I>shraddha&#x301; </I>for the goal in whose direction I am moving. In the Vedic language <I>shrat</I> means &ldquo;ultimate truth, supreme truth, eternal truth&rdquo;. In other words, that truth which I recognize as supreme, above which there can be nothing higher, is called <I>shrat</I>, and the movement towards that <I>shrat</I> is <I>shraddha&#x301;</I>. <I>Shrat + dha&#x301; + d&#x301;a + striya&#x301;m n&#x32D;a&#x301;p</I>. <I>Dvitiiyam&#x301; shraddhaya&#x301; yuktam&#x301;</I> &ndash; <I></I>I will have to have <I>shraddha&#x301;</I> for my goal, for the supreme beatitude, for that in which I am striving to be established.

In the mundane world, in the psychic world, one cannot accomplish anything as long as the darkness of ignorance remains. In ancient Tantra that darkness of ignorance was called <I>gu</I>, and removing that <I>gu</I>, getting rid of it, defeating it, forcefully removing it, was called <I>guru</I>. One who removes the darkness is <I>guru</I>. One will have to maintain devotion for guru who removes this darkness because guru shows the way. If one does not move according to guru&#146;s word then one can fall into danger at any moment.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..44"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=44 type=paragraph --><I>Trtiiyam&#x301; gurupu&#x301;janam</I>. There are also different types of gurus. Among these there are three main categories. The first explains things: &ldquo;Do this, do not do that.&rdquo; He explains all these things but afterwards he does not endeavor to find out if one is doing it or not. He gives his teachings, takes some <I>daks&#x301;in&#x301;a&#x301;</I> [ritual offering] as well, accepts <I>pran&#x301;a&#x301;m</I> [salutation] and some beaten rice, and it ends there. This is the third class guru. I would prefer not to use the word &ldquo;guru&rdquo; for this third class guru.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..45"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=45 type=paragraph -->The second class guru is one who gives his teachings, explains things and tries to see if they are following them correctly, if they are walking the proper path. This is the second class guru. They are recognized as guru.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..46"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=46 type=paragraph -->The first class guru is one who gives the teachings, certainly, and keeps track of his disciples as well, but who also lets them know that he will punish them to set them right. This is the first class guru. How is it? <I>Nigraha&#x301;nugrahe shakto gururityabhidhiiyate</I>. One who loves very much, who loves with all their heart, but who meets out strict punishment when he sees impropriety or mindless action, is the true guru. Here the <I>shloka</I> is talking about this best class of guru, not the middling or lowest class of guru.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..47"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=47 type=paragraph --><I>Caturtho samata&#x301;bha&#x301;vo</I>. This is the fourth factor, to look on all with equal vision, that is, you will not harbour any inferiority or superiority complex. You are neither lesser nor greater than anyone else. When everyone is the progeny of the Supreme Father then no one can be inferior or superior. No one can be low caste or high caste. Not only that &ndash; the pandits and the fools are brothers; the rich and the poor are brothers. All are children of the Supreme Father. The person who thinks himself to be superior suffers from a mental disease. And the person who thinks himself to be inferior also suffers from a mental disease. As long as this mental disease exists nothing can be accomplished. Inferiority complex is bad; superiority complex is also bad. Defeatist complex is bad, and escapist complex is also bad. Many people think that if they run away from everything then they can perhaps save themselves. That will not do. One has to take strict care of one&#146;s responsibilities. The meaning of this shloka is that one must not harbour any kind of complex. No kind of mental disease should be permitted. People speak high-sounding words but do not put them into action. In the field of action they accept untouchability and caste distinction. They are dangerous people. They are not only dangerous for the society but for themselves as well. They have their feet in two different boats. They can drown at any moment. A person has to remain in one boat. A few days ago in Siliguri I said that a person should be <I>ekabuddhi</I> [single-minded], not <I>anekabuddhi</I> [many-minded].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..48"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=48 type=paragraph -->There is that well-known story. In a pond there lived many fish. One day the fishermen decided to catch all the fish the following morning. Among the fish there was one who was a great intellectual. His name was <I>Shatabuddhi</I> [hundred-minded]. He told his wife: &ldquo;Let the fishermen come, I have a hundred ways to swim away and save myself from them.&rdquo; There was another fish whose name was <I>Sahasrabuddhi</I> [thousand-minded]. <I>Sahasrabuddhi</I> said: &ldquo;I have a thousand ways to swim away and save myself.&rdquo; There was another fish whose name was <I>Ekabuddhi</I>. He told his wife: &ldquo;Look, I have only one mind and that mind is telling me that if the fishermen throw their nets then I won&#146;t survive. So let us go to another pond during the night.&rdquo; They left, and the next morning the fishermen came, threw their nets and caught all the fish in the pond. Then the fish <I>Ekabuddhi</I> told his wife:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..49"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=49 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Shatabuddhih shirasyastyayam&#x301; lambate ca sahasradhii; Ekabuddhiraham&#x301; bhadre kriid&#x301;a&#x301;mi vimale jale.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..50"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=50 type=paragraph -->&ldquo; &lsquo;Look at that. The fish called <I>Shatabuddhi</I> is jumping in the fisherman&#146;s net, and the fish called <I>Sahasrabuddhi</I> is dangling from the fisherman&#146;s hand, while I, <I>Ekabuddhi</I>, am playing in pure water.&rsquo; &rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..51"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=51 type=paragraph -->So one will have to be <I>Ekabuddhi;</I> one must act with a single mind. This single mind teaches the following, that when all are children of the Supreme Father, then there can be no difference of higher or lower. A certain person may be more learned, society may show him or her more respect, but as a human being society cannot consider that person superior to another. All are children of <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I>, so one who accepts caste distinctions displeases <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I>. <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> is dissatisfied with their behaviour. They will not get his grace. One who thinks another to be stupid, who hates others, suffers from a mental disease. That person hates a child of the Supreme Father, so they can never get his grace. Similarly, one who is wealthy and thinks others to be less than animals, can also never get his grace. His grace remains far away because that person has not yet proven him or herself to be a human being.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="12..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The word <I>sarva</I> contains three letters: <I>sa, ra</I>, and <I>va</I>. <I>Sa</I> means <I>sattvagun&#x301;a</I> [sentient force], <I>ra</I> means &ldquo;energy&rdquo;, and <I>va</I> means &ldquo;nature&rdquo; or characteristics. The world is composed of these three and they exist in <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I>. For this reason the final container of everything is <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I>. For instance, I create an elephant in my thoughts; certainly I know it as well. In the same way, <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> is the knower of the entire universe. <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I>, however, is not the knower of the universe in the same sense that we knowingly perceive external objects. Ordinarily the easy knowledge that a person acquires about external objects comes through the medium of his or her sense organs. One gets that knowledge by coming in contact with a certain object. However, for <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> there is no external object. Everything is internal. So the term &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo; as it applies to human beings does not apply to <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph --><I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> is the lord of both heaven and hell. For this reason it is said that everything is held within Him; nothing is outside Him. There is, in fact, no separate region such as heaven or hell. A spiritual aspirant is established in heaven or eternity by performing spiritual sadhana. This means that <I>vidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301; </I>[cosmic centripetal force] has two forces, <I>samvit</I> and <I>hla&#x301;dinii</I>. Through <I>samvit</I> a human being earns knowledge, moving away from the darkness of ignorance; through <I>samvit</I> humans move towards the life. <I>A&#x301;hla&#x301;da</I> means &ldquo;bliss&rdquo;. Since <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> is the blissful entity, as a result of <I>samvit</I> the experience of bliss appears within the human being. Gradually he or she reaches <I>satyaloka</I> and beyond that the human merges and becomes one with the ultimate blissful entity situated one of far shore of <I>satyaloka</I> [the causal world of macrocosm].<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.12.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#12.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> In one words, a person who performs spiritual sadhana advances towards <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I>, and that peaceful heavenly abode where <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> resides is obtained.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->What is degradation? The divine effulgence earned through the performance of spiritual sadhana dispels the darkness of the spiritual aspirant&#146;s mind. And the moment we turn away from sadhana <I></I>that darkness comes back to our mind to stay and our mind gradually advances towards deeper darkness. Thus in our <I>gurupu&#x301;ja&#x301; </I>mantra the guru is the one who banishes that darkness of ignorance which befools our eyes and which arises as a result of our mind&#146;s movement towards darkness. So, the guru is not a spatial entity. One who moves towards <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> moves towards the world of knowledge.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Just as <I>vidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301;</I> has two forces, <I>avidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301;</I> [cosmic centrifugal force] also has two forces, <I>viks&#x301;epa</I> and <I>a&#x301;varan&#x301;ii</I>. The more a living being moves towards darkness, the more they gradually forget their true nature, their actual source. They think themselves to be separate from the Supreme Being and gradually they move towards deeper and deeper darkness. This is referred to as the living being&#146;s movement towards darkness. However <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> is everywhere. We have heard this in the Mahabharata. Since this is entirely the divine drama of one <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I>, wherever one goes, be it heaven or hell, their momentum comes from <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I>.<!-- /block --></p>

Not only that, there is something else as well. The English synonym for <I>vasu</I> is &ldquo;abode&rdquo;. The Farsi word is a&#x301;<I>ba&#x301;d</I>. Allahabad means &ldquo;abode of Allah&rdquo;. The word <I>a&#x301;ba&#x301;d</I> has been added to the names of many cities, for example, Allahabad or Elahabad, Jahanabad, Farukhabad, Saedabad, Hyderabad, and so forth.<!-- /block --></p>

For example, he is in a place measured by ten fingers. Here the literal meaning of the words &ldquo;ten fingers&rdquo; will not do, because it is not correct to always take the philological meaning of something; its inner meaning should be accepted. For example, a certain gentleman is walking along a path. Say his name is Pain&#x32D;ca&#x301;nan Jha&#x301;. We call him saying: &ldquo;Mr. Pain&#x32D;canan, come over here, please.&rdquo; Does Pain&#x32D;ca&#x301;nan here mean a man with five faces? No, of course not. Pain&#x32D;ca&#x301;nan is the name of that man. Here one must not take the literal meaning but rather the inner meaning.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="13..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->We have seen that <I>vasu</I> means a habitable place. I want to say one thing in this regard. In ancient India there was a king by the name of Dasharathi Vasu. He used to make living arrangements in his kingdom for destitute people, to give them a place to live, so he was called Dasharathi Vasu by the public. Today also <I>Vasu</I> is one surname.<!-- /block --></p>

Beyond them exists the vast quinquelemental universe and the five sensory organs and five motor organs as well as various psychic planes, such as the conscious, subconscious and causal. The vibrational flow of <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> is active everywhere. In the flow of <I>Pratisain&#x32D;cara</I> the <I>ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a mana</I> or causal mind is referred to as the <I>sa&#x301;ma&#x301;nya mana</I> or microcosmic causal mind because in the path of <I>Pratisain&#x32D;cara</I>, <I></I>the macrocosmic causal mind cannot remain since the microcosmic causal mind is the final stage of this path of <I>Pratisain&#x32D;cara</I> while the macrocosmic causal mind is the first stage in the path of <I>Sain&#x32D;cara</I>. Causal mind means mind in seed form, subconscious mind [subtle mind] means mind in sprout form, and conscious mind [crude mind] means mind in fully expressed form. In causal mind also there are possibilities of vibration. Causal mind is a part of mind but <I>turiiya</I> [a stage of purely spiritual realization] is not a part of mind.<!-- /block --></p>

But for expression or the possibility of expression to exist, if a relation between <I>turiiya</I> and <I>triloka</I> is not established then that expression is not possible; in spite of some vibration existing it will be extremely limited, partial. Uninterrupted expression is not possible. For example, if you remove one potful of water, then two, then three from a pitcher of water, will any water remain in the pitcher at the end? Certainly not. However, if on the one hand, you keep taking out potfuls of water but at the same time an uninterrupted stream of water is pouring into the neck of the pitcher, then will the pitcher ever become empty? Of course not! Hence <I>turiiya</I> is a state of limitless potential.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->In the <I>Shaevatantra</I>, dharma is compared to a four-legged ox. It is said: <I>es&#x301;a dharma catus&#x301;pa&#x301;dah</I> [this dharma has four legs] &ndash; conscious, subconscious, causal and <I>turiiya</I>. You may have noticed that an ox can remain standing still for a long time. The reason is that there is a certain nerve in the bodies of living beings called <I>ku&#x301;rma na&#x301;d&#x301;ii</I>. If one can gain control over this <I>ku&#x301;rma na&#x301;d&#x301;ii</I> then the body can remain motionless. You will see that apart from two particular animals, this is generally not the case. One of them is the ox. You can see oxen remaining as motionless as a stone in the road. At that time they keep their minds fixed in the <I>ku&#x301;rma na&#x301;d&#x301;ii</I>. Human beings can also do this. Another is the lizard. One has to maintain control over this <I>ku&#x301;rma na&#x301;d&#x301;ii</I>, the nerve that controls the thyroid gland.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph --><I>Es&#x301;a dharma catus&#x301;pa&#x301;dah</I>. That is, dharma is a four-legged entity (<I>vista&#x301;ra</I>, i.e., expansion<I>, rasa</I>, i.e., flow<I>, seva&#x301;</I>, i.e., service <I></I>and <I>moks&#x301;a</I> or <I>turiiya</I>). We are familiar with three of these but not with the fourth. The effort to become familiar with that fourth leg is called dharma. Dharma is an all-round effort to become familiar with the state of <I>turiiya</I>.<!-- /block --></p>

That is, whatever is present in the macrocosm is also present in the microcosm. If an entire ocean is filled with milk, then a drop of that ocean will also be milk. In the same way these eight <I>vasus</I> or eight places are also concealed within the human being and are vibrated with one or another vibration of <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I>. Just as there are various crude and subtle expressions within the cosmic mind, there are also different crude and subtle expressions within the human mind, and all these expressions are manifested through the medium of different <I>vrttis</I>. There are six <I>cakras</I> from <I>mu&#x301;la&#x301;dha&#x301;ra</I> to <I>a&#x301;jin&#x32D;a&#x301;</I>. These six <I>cakras</I> are controlled from different places in the body. Each <I>cakra</I> is vibrated in a certain way with the vibration of energy from the cosmic mind. In the same way, the seventh <I>cakra </I>or <I>gurucakra</I> is also vibrated by a special energy of <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I>.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="14..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Now the question is: how is mental strength increased? <I>Trn&#x301;a&#x301;dapi suniicena</I>. It is often seen that when someone says something an immediate reaction arises in a person&#146;s mind. This is quite natural; it is not a sin. To stand in the way of sin, to retaliate or fight against it, this is natural. However, this does not prove how much internal stamina or force a person has. Thus it is said: <I>trn&#x301;a&#x301;dapi suniicena</I>. Mahaprabhu [Shrii Caetanya Deva] gave this instruction to his devoted disciples:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..2"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Trn&#x301;a&#x301;dapi suniicena taroriva sahis&#x301;n&#x301;una&#x301;;<br>Ama&#x301;nina&#x301; ma&#x301;nadena kiirtaniiya&#x301; sada&#x301; harih.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..3"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->[You must be more humble than the grass and as tolerant as the tree. You must give respect to those whom no one respects, and always do <I>kiirtana</I> of Lord.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->In order for someone to awaken or gradually increase their internal stamina one will have to engage in proper work as follows:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph --><I>Trn&#x301;a&#x301;dapi suniicena</I>. A person should be more humble than a blade of grass. Grass is such an ordinary thing. People walk on grass and the grass endures it. However, that grass contains tremendous life force. Rather, grass has even more life force than human beings. How much strength do animals like cows and elephants get by eating grass! Yet this grass bears the neglect of human beings without showing any reaction. But here it does not say &ldquo;as tolerant as grass&rdquo;, but rather that human beings will have to acquire more tolerance than grass.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Let us suppose someone attacks you. What will you do? Will you grab your rifle and run after them? No. First see how much tolerance you have. Endure it to the extent that you are able. Afterwards, if the matter goes beyond your capacity to bear, then that is another matter.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Now, when you have proven that you have within you enough capacity to endure, then what will happen? Your courage will increase. You will have faith that a certain amount of strength is stored within you. Then if you tell someone, &ldquo;leave your sinful ways, take to the path of spirituality, take initiation, do sadhana,&rdquo; you will find that your work is accomplished. This will be the case nearly ninety percent of the time. And if your work is not accomplished then other path will open up.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="14..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph --><I>Taroriva sahis&#x301;n&#x301;una&#x301;</I>. A very large tree which does not bear fruit is called <I>vanaspati</I> in Sanskrit, and a tree which is large in size but which also bears fruit is called <I>vrks&#x301;a</I> or <I>taru</I>, while those trees which are very beautiful to look at are only called <I>taru</I>. If they are not beautiful to look at then they are called <I>vrks&#x301;a</I>. In Sanskrit all plants are called <I>mahiiruha</I>, that is, that which parts the earth and rises up. A small sapling can be called <I>mahiiruha</I> even though it is small in size, although in this case it can be called <I>shishu-mahiiruha</I> [baby <I>mahiiruha</I>].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->To be tolerant like a <I>taru</I> means that a human being must be as enduring as a <I>vrks&#x301;a</I> or <I>taru</I>, which tolerates so many blows and counterblows. However, this does not mean that if a wicked person comes to strike you or kill you that you will bear it without protest. It means that you should test how much strength to endure you have within you, so that a deep belief in yourself will awaken through knowing to what extent you can endure.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Now it is seen that you do not put your capacity to endure to the test. If something happens you react right away. I will say that instead of doing that, from time to time test how much capacity to endure you have inside you so that your self-confidence will become steadier. Be like a tree, which does not protest even if it is cut or ask water from human beings in the scorching heat of summer, but rather gives flowers to the priests and fruits and shade to travelers without asking those priests or travelers for water.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="14..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Bear in mind that you have a duty towards others, but that no one has any duty towards you. Everyone&#146;s individual duty is fixed. Only one who move forward with this as his or her only thought can do proper service. Otherwise the thought may remain in the mind of the one doing service that I have done such and such work for that person, so that person ought to do such and such for me. The thought must remain in the mind of the one doing service that I have a duty towards others but no one has any duty towards me.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Just as a tree serves and benefits everyone by giving shade, fruit, flowers and firewood without asking anything in return, a spiritual aspirant should lead their life with the same kind of noble sense of ethics. But it is interesting to see that there are many people in the society who can be heard saying that they have been doing service to society for many years. Their secret wish is that they might be given a pension or a medal. They hope for a recommendation from the government saying that since I played an important role in the struggle for independence then an independent India should give me a government pension. This kind of secret wish remains hidden in their mind. These kinds of people hope for some government title or government grant in exchange for their service to society, just as a shopkeeper exchanges salt for money. Actually such service is not service at all.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph --><I>Ama&#x301;nina&#x301; ma&#x301;nadena</I>. <I>A&#x301;pani nirabhima&#x301;nii anye dive ma&#x301;na</I>. People commonly show respect to those people who have achieved an honorable position in society, but here Mahaprabhu&#146;s statement is: show respect to those neglected people who have no position in society, who are not held in esteem, to whom no one shows respect, those whom no one asks how they are doing. Inquire about how they are doing and help them to become established in society.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->You must have often noticed that when a well-dressed gentleman talks, people address them with terms of respect such as <I>a&#x301;pani</I> [respectful &ldquo;you&rdquo;] <I></I>or <I>a&#x301;jin&#x32D;e</I> [yes, sir]. But when talking with an ordinary labourer, you address them as <I>tumi</I> or <I>tui</I> [familiar and very familiar &ldquo;You&rdquo;]. When the stamp of poverty is visible on the face or in the dress then people use the familiar forms of address like <I>tumi</I> or <I>tui</I>, but when the stamp of affluence is on the face or the dress then people spontaneously speak to that person with respect. In Ananda Marga I address everyone with the familiar form, <I>tumi</I>, as in the English &ldquo;you&rdquo; [in the intimate sense]. <I></I><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph --><I>Kiirtaniiya&#x301;h sada&#x301; Harih</I>. What is <I>kiirtana</I>? When someone vocally sings the praises of God so that others can hear, it is called <I>kiirtana</I>. When it stays on the lips but is barely audible, then it is called <I>ma&#x301;nasokti</I>. And when it is confined to the lips and does not come out at all, then we call it <I>upa&#x301;m&#x301;shu</I>. When it passes the lips and enters into another&#146;s ear then we call it <I>va&#x301;canika</I>. When it is not a whisper but can be heard by distant ears, then that loud utterance is <I>kiirtana</I>. If this song of praise does not reach the ears of others, then we cannot classify it as <I>kiirtana</I> or give it the same respect. Now, when one does <I>kiirtana</I>, that person benefits and the person who hears <I>kiirtana</I> also benefits. People also sing <I>bhajans</I> [devotional songs] <I></I>in a loud voice, but for their own satisfaction rather than for the satisfaction of others.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph --><I>Bhajana</I> is also <I>va&#x301;canika</I> but it is not <I>kiirtana</I>. <I>Kiirtana</I> and <I>bhajana</I> are not the same. <I>Kiirtana&#146;s</I> greatness exceeds that of <I>bhajana</I>; it is incomparable. The difference between the two is firstly that <I>bhajana</I> is not heard at as great a distance as <I>kiirtana</I>, and secondly that people sing <I>bhajans</I> so that they can experience happiness, not so much to give happiness to others. Conversely, the ideation behind <I>kiirtana</I> is that others might also enjoy the same happiness listening to the praises of God that I get by singing the praises of God. This is the fundamental difference between <I>bhajana</I> and <I>kiirtana</I>. For this reason, Mahaprabhu has said <I>kiirttaniyah sada&#x301; harih</I>, rather than <I>bhajaniiyah sada&#x301; harih</I>. The benefit of <I>kiirtana</I> is that one whose mind is dirty becomes purified and one whose mind is already pure becomes even purer. One whose mind is holy becomes even holier. One whose mind was soiled but is no longer so is <I>vimala</I>, and one where it is not known if there was dirt in his or her mind or not, but at present there is not, is called <I>nirmala</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Now <I>kiirtana</I> helps everyone. Whose <I>kiirtana</I>? <I>Kiirttaniiyah sada&#x301; harih</I>, that is, always do the <I>kiirtana </I>of the Lord. In ancient times people used to do the <I>kiirtana</I> of the kings and emperors. During the Mogul era, at the time of Akbar, singing the praises of the emperor became a traditional practice. <I>Dilliishvarah jagadiishvaro va&#x301;</I> [sing the praise of emperor of Delhi as well as of God in the same tone]. But what is gained by doing the <I>kiirtana</I> of this mortal man? Mahaprabhu gave the instruction to do the <I>kiirtana</I> of the Lord, not of the emperor.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Now the meaning of the word <I>Hari</I> is &ldquo;one who steals, one who robs&rdquo;. That is, he who, without their knowing, steals the sins or <I>sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras</I> that a person has accumulated over lifetimes. Sins increase the burden of a person&#146;s life; it makes a person&#146;s life unbearable. So by whatever means a person&#146;s burden must be lightened. Buddha used to say:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..24"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->Sinca bhiikkhu imam&#x301; na&#x301;vam&#x301; sitta&#x301; te lahu messati<br>Munca pure munca paccheta majjhe munca bhavassa pa&#x301;ragu.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..25"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->Buddha says: &ldquo;O mendicant, look and see. Water is entering the boat that you have boarded in the hopes of crossing to the other side of the river. So get rid of that water right away.&rdquo; <I>Sinca bhikkhu imam&#x301; na&#x301;vam&#x301;</I>. If you get rid of the water your boat&#146;s load will be lightened. <I>Sitta&#x301; te lahu messyati</I>. A human being&#146;s burden grows along with the past, the present and the future. For example, perhaps you are thinking: once you were eating rich, delicious and costly foods such as ha&#x301;luya&#x301;puri, murg-mashallam, namkiin pola&#x301;o &ndash; this is all the burden of the past. Similarly, today you will eat this and that, you will wear such and such, afterwards you will go to your friend&#146;s house and they will ask you about what you are wearing &ndash; this is the burden of the present. In the same way, you will earn money in the future by doing business, become rich and gain esteem in the society &ndash; this is the burden of the future. Buddha warned his mendicants who were thirsty for liberation: O mendicants, lighten the burden that lies before you.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->Buddha gave this explanation of the word <I>bra&#x301;hman&#x301;a:</I><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..27"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->Yassa pure ca pacche ca majjhe ca natthi kincanam<br>Akincanam&#x301; ana&#x301;da&#x301;nam&#x301; tamaham&#x301; vrumi bra&#x301;hman&#x301;am.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..28"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;That person who does not carry any burden from the past, who has shaken off the burden of the present and who does not create any new burden for the future, who does not want anything from anyone or gives anything to anyone, is a true <I>bra&#x301;hman&#x301;a</I>.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->Today, however, we see its opposite. The priests of today openly hanker after <I>daks&#x301;in&#x301;a&#x301;</I> [an offering in the form of money or property] even after receiving <I>sidha&#x301;</I> [an offering in the form of materials such as rice, vegetables.] So whatever form this burden may take, it has to be shaken off. If a person is to reach the other shore of life, then he has to lessen his life&#146;s burden. But human beings are very weak, so they cling to their burden and do not want to give it up. Even if they know that all these things constitute their life&#146;s burden and there is the fear of their life&#146;s boat sinking due to this burden, even then they do not want to give them up. Even if they know that their son is very wicked, they do not want to disown him. So what will happen then? Who will bear their burden? If Parama Purus&#x301;a comes to them and says: O human being, give me your burden, I will bear it for you &ndash; even then they are not ready to do so.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->There is a story from Japan in this regard. In Japanese their country is called &ldquo;Nippon&rdquo;, in English, &ldquo;Japan&rdquo;. Once there was an immense load of wood with an old lady. She was at death&#146;s door. She was saying: &ldquo;I have to carry this load of wood every day. If I die now it will be a good thing. How much of a load can I carry everyday in this way! I can no longer take it&rdquo;. At that very moment the god of death came to her and said: &ldquo;Old woman, come along with me. You won&#146;t have to carry this heavy load any longer&rdquo;. That burden had been on the hands of old lady for so long. She thought, how best to carry it? The old lady said: &ldquo;Lord of death, it is good that you have come. Please lend me a hand. Please pick up my load and place it on my head.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

Due to these <I>pratyabhijin&#x32D;a&#x301;</I> human beings are bound by various bondages and they do not want to be liberated from these bondages so quickly.

Even if they make efforts to free themselves from these bondages they still do not succeed. The mind does not want to distance itself from those bondages because it gets temporary pleasure from them. A dog cuts its lips chewing on a bone in the cremation ground. Blood flows from them and a little of that blood is swallowed. The dog thinks that this is juice coming from the bone. Much later, when a burning sensation starts coming, then it stops chewing on the bone. The same happens with people. They are not getting juice from the bone but rather blood from their own lips.<!-- /block --></p>

If he does not steal them, then these weak and obstinate human beings will never be able to cross over to the other side of life&#146;s river. So <I>Hari&#146;s</I> duty is to lighten the load of human beings. Hence it is only fitting that people do the <I>kiirtana</I> of <I>Hari</I>, their greatest friend, and not of anyone else.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="15..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The world of living beings has been created within the imagination of <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I>. It is the resolution of Taraka Brahma to emancipate living beings, but only those who want liberation get liberation. When a human wants or longs for liberation, they attain the sadguru. <I>Muktya&#x301;ka&#x301;un&#x32D;ks&#x301;aya&#x301; sadgurupra&#x301;ptih</I>. However some want liberation and some do not. One person wants liberation but does not get it, while another gets liberation even though they do not want it. What kind of a thing is this? Some people say, <I>ma&#x301;un&#x32D;gana&#x301; maran&#x301; sama&#x301;n ha&#x301;i, mat koi ma&#x301;un&#x32D;go bhikh</I> [to beg like death, so do not beg]. Then some other say <I>bina&#x301;</I> <I>ma&#x301;un&#x32D;ge motii miile, ma&#x301;un&#x32D;ge miile na&#x301; ra&#x301;kh</I> [You can get the boon of emerald without asking, but not even ashes if you beg for them]. It is a strange thing, a mysterious thing, and this mystery is the drama of <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I>. Living beings are only characters in that drama. Human beings have come to this earth with a fixed role to play, and that role must be properly observed. One should always bear in mind that one is a character in this divine drama. And who is the author or composer of this drama? <I>Ta&#x301;raka Brahma</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->This reminds of an old story from the <I>Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata</I>. After the battle, the battleground of Kuruks&#x301;etra became a cremation ground. At the end of the war some people came there from the Kaoravas&#146; side, among them were women and a few elderly gentlemen. The mother of the Kaoravas, Gandhari, was also there. Kunti, the mother of the Pandavas, and Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, the Pandava&#146;s friend, were present as well, along with the blind Dhritarastra. Everyone was standing in that cremation ground and weeping. The Kaoravas were also weeping, even Gandhari, for she had lost her beloved hundred sons in the war.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a approached Gandhari and said: &ldquo;Mother, why are you weeping? Death is a natural law of the world. <I>Ja&#x301;tasya hi dhruvormrtyuh</I>. One who is born will die. So what is there to cry about?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Gandhari replied: &ldquo;Yes Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, I have also told the distressed suffering the bereavement of death the same thing that you are telling me today. I have consoled them with those very same words. You know this and I know this, so what is the need of telling me this?&rdquo; She continued: &ldquo;Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, you have come here today to console me in my grief, but I ask you, behind this great event whose mind was at work? Who was the author of this great plan? Was it not you?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a replied: &ldquo;Those who have committed injustice and sinned have been punished. What can I do about that?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Gandhari again said: &ldquo;Everything you have said up until now is quite correct. From the worldly point of view, everything that has happened up until now is as it should be, because every action must have its reaction. But my point is this: You yourself are <I>Ta&#x301;raka Brahma;</I> your duty is to liberate the living beings. You can give liberation to whomever you please. In form of <I>Ta&#x301;raka Brahma</I> you can create as you wish and destroy as you wish. In this drama of yours you have created many characters who are very honest people, ideological people. If one does virtuous deeds then one gets liberation. In order to teach the people this you create these kinds of characters. And you also create sinful characters in order to teach the people how much a person degenerates as a result of their sinful behavior. In this drama of the great war which has taken place in field of Kuruks&#x301;etra, you could have had my hundred sons play roles of righteousness and the Pandavas play roles of unrighteousness, if you had wished it. In that case my hundred sons would have gotten salvation and the Pandavas would have gone to hell. You are <I>Ta&#x301;raka Brahma</I>, the author of everything, and now, after having made me cry, you come to console me!&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->What Gandhari said was correct. <I>Ta&#x301;raka Brahma</I> formulates his plan in order to produce <I>itiha&#x301;s</I> [history with educative value], to teach the people. If one does honest works then one moves towards the eternal truth, and if one performs dishonest works then one moves towards untruth. He wanted to fix this great teaching in the minds of human beings.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Thereafter comes the other part of the story. Gandhari said: &ldquo;Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, give me permission to curse you.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a replied: &ldquo;Okay, curse me. I give you permission.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Then Gandhari cursed him by saying: &ldquo;Just as my entire lineage has been destroyed before my very eyes, may your Ya&#x301;dava lineage be destroyed before your very eyes as well.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Let it be so,&rdquo; Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a replied.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Human beings should always remember that living beings are only actors in the vast universal drama composed by <I>Ta&#x301;raka Brahma</I>. This is not their real identity. Someone may play the role of a king in a drama but they might not even have two handfuls of rice in their house. Someone plays the role of a poor subject in the drama, but in real life they may be a very rich man. One should remember: We are only playing specific roles in a great drama. I will act properly according to the role I have been given in this drama. This is a person&#146;s duty. It is meaningless for a person to think about anything more than this &ndash; about what is beyond one&#146;s power.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="16..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->This shloka is from the <I>Yajurveda</I>. The <I>Yajurveda</I> is mainly concerned with rites. The composition of the Vedas began roughly 15,000 years ago. In those ancient times written script was not yet known. Written script was invented much later. During that era the <I>rs&#x301;is</I>, seers of truth, who composed the Vedas taught their pupils the <I>rks</I> [hymns] they made, and by listening to them those pupils committed them to memory. Since written script did not exist in that era, there was no opportunity to write books; so rather than reading books, knowledge and teachings had to be committed to memory while listening to them. In Sanskrit <I>shruti</I> means &ldquo;ear&rdquo;. The word <I>shruti</I> is derived by adding the suffix <I>ktin</I> to the verbal root <I>shru</I>. For this reason, another name for the Vedas is <I>Shruti</I>. <I>Veda</I> means &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo; and <I>shruti</I> means &ldquo;that knowledge which is acquired by listening.&rdquo; This was the system in those olden days.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The first script was invented almost five and a half thousand years ago. The name of that ancient script was Saendhavii. It was first invented in Mahenjodaro. Many ancient scripts have still not yet been deciphered. The next two scripts that we know of are the Bra&#x301;hmii and Kharos&#x301;t&#x301;ii scripts. Bra&#x301;hmii script was written from right to left, like Urdu, while Kharos&#x301;t&#x301;ii was written from left to right, like modern Indian scripts. However, during the reign of the emperor Ashok, the use of Bra&#x301;hmii script was prevalent in all of north India. Kharos&#x301;t&#x301;ii was little used by comparison. For this reason Ashok used Bra&#x301;hmii script on his stone inscriptions. In Laoria and other areas one sees the exclusive use of Bra&#x301;hmii script.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->After the invention of written script, people began to think about the fact that up until then the Vedas had not been written down. How much can really be committed to memory by listening? In this way, it was discovered that a large portion of the Vedas had disappeared. How much can human beings commit to memory? Sixty percent of the Vedas remained and forty percent was lost and will never be recovered. So everyone realized that the Vedas had to be written down, and while doing so it remained to be seen which portion of the Vedas was the oldest, which portion was from the middle period and which portion was the most recent. In this way, they were classified and collected according to the antiquity of their composition, and divided into the ancient, middle and recent portions. The most ancient portion is called the <I>Rgveda</I>, because each <I>shloka</I> is called a <I>rk</I> in this Veda. The name of the middle-period portion is the <I>Yajurveda</I>, and that of the most recent portion, the <I>Atharvaveda</I>. <I>Atharva</I> was the name of one <I>Rs&#x301;i</I>. Since the inspiration and enthusiasm for the composition of this portion came from him, it was given the name <I>Atharvaveda</I>. In Sanskrit <I>atharva</I> means &ldquo;aged, very old&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The <I>Yajurveda</I> is concerned mostly with rites. The word <I>yajuh</I> means &ldquo;that in which rites are predominant.&rdquo; The pandits accomplished in the <I>Yajurveda</I> were called <I>ardhvayyu</I>, in the <I>Rgveda</I>, <I>rtvika</I>, and in the <I>Atharvaveda</I>, <I>brahman&#x301;</I>. Now each of the three Vedas contain songs. In old Sanskrit songs were called <I>sa&#x301;ma</I>. These song portions were separated from the three Vedas and collected together into a fourth Veda, which was given the name <I>Sa&#x301;mveda</I>. The <I>Sa&#x301;mveda</I> was not originally a Veda; it is only a collection of the songs from the other three Vedas. The pandits well-versed in <I>Sa&#x301;mveda</I> used to be called <I>Udga&#x301;ta&#x301;</I>, and of the four kinds of pandits, those who used to preserve the link amongst the four were called <I>Hota&#x301;</I>. In certain areas of India one can still find people with the surname &ldquo;Hota&#x301;&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->We were discussing the <I>Atharvaveda</I>. The <I>Atharvaveda</I> is also quite ancient. There is a <I>shloka</I> in this Veda [<I>Yajurveda</I>] <I></I>about <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I>.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="16..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph --><I>Apa&#x301;n&#x301;ipa&#x301;do javano grahiita&#x301;</I>. <I>A</I> denotes negation; <I>pa&#x301;n&#x301;i</I> means &ldquo;palm of the hand,&rdquo; for example, a <I>viin&#x301;a&#x301;</I> [musical instrument resembling the violin] in the hand or <I>pa&#x301;n&#x301;i</I> is <I>viin&#x301;a&#x301;pa&#x301;n&#x301;i</I>. Similarly, one who does not have <I>pa&#x301;n&#x301;i or pa&#x301;da</I>, that is, hands or feet, is <I>apa&#x301;n&#x301;ipa&#x301;da</I>. <I>Javano grahiita&#x301;</I> &ndash; &ldquo;although He wanders about [without feet], He accepts whatever anyone offers [without hands].&rdquo; This seems a little strange to hear. <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> has no hands. Still, if someone offers him something out of love then He accepts it. Let us suppose someone in Patna offers something to <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I>. Wherever He might be, He accepts it, yet He is <I>apa&#x301;n&#x301;i</I>. Similarly, He is <I>apa&#x301;da</I>, &ldquo;He has no feet&rdquo;, nevertheless He moves easily from one place to another within the blink of an eye. He is <I>acaks&#x301;u</I>, He has no eyes, yet He looks all around Him like a lion and sees everything in the universe. He is <I>akarn&#x301;a</I>, He has no ears, yet He hears whatever is audible in this universe and whatever is inaudible.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->This creation is limited. It is only the expression of <I>Parama Pursus&#x301;a</I>. At the time of performing any kind of action, a relationship is established between the person and the object. For example, if something is accepted then a relationship is established with that object. If I move down a path then a relationship is established with that path. Let us say a person arrives in Chiriatand from Patna. Here a relationship has been established between the mind and Chiriatand. If, in the next moment, one wants to go mentally from Chiriatand to Patliputra Colony, then one does not require any feet. Similarly, everything in this world is within the mind of <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->For human beings there are two worlds, the internal world and the external world. In the internal world, the psychic world, a person gets whatever they want in that very moment, because in that case everything can be done with only the mind, without the need of the motor and sensory organs. In the external world this is not so. There the different organs, such as the eyes, feet, hands, etc., are necessary. But for <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> there is only one world, the internal world. There is no external world. Say, for example, someone thinks that they cannot understand <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> through logic. But my internal self says, &ldquo;he is with me,&rdquo; and that very same moment <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> hears what you say. <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> needs no auditory organ in order to hear what anyone is thinking. Similarly, he does not need hands in order to accept something. He does not need eyes in order to see something, because everything is within his mind. Everything is born out of his psychic imagination. Let us say someone, while doing <I>gurupu&#x301;ja&#x301;</I>, says <I>tava dravyam&#x301; jagatguro tubhyameva samarpaye</I> [and offers something mentally]. Here <I>Parama Pursus&#x301;a</I> does not need any worldly hands in order to accept whatever is offered.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph --><I>Sah vetti vedyam&#x301;</I>. He knows everything knowable in this universe, but no one is able to know him. Here the word <I>vedya</I> has been used for &ldquo;knowable&rdquo;. The act of knowing means the subjectivization of external objectivities. Generally we get a rough conception of an external object by seeing it, however this sensory perception is not knowledge. Here <I>vedya</I> means &ldquo;knowable&rdquo;, &ldquo;capable of being known&rdquo;. <I>Vedya</I> is not the same for <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> and the living being, because in the case of the living being, knowing takes place both in the mental world and in the external world, while for <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> there is no external world. For this reason he sees everything with his mental eyes. He knows what is written on any page of any book. So he is the knower of all.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph --><I>Na ca tasya&#x301;sti vetta&#x301;</I>. No one is his knower, because <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> is the subject of all and everything is his object. Normally the subject knows the object but the object cannot know the subject. Thus it is correctly said<I>: na ca tasya&#x301;sti vetta&#x301;</I>. But there is one thing to be pointed out &ndash; when a spiritual aspirant meditates on <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I>, <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> becomes the sole subject of the spiritual aspirant&#146;s mind. So, it is only through sadhana that the living being can know <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I>. Generally, when a person sits in meditation they make one mistake. They think: &ldquo;I am seeing <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> in front of me.&rdquo; Rather than think this they should think: &ldquo;I am sitting in front of <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> doing meditation and <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> is seeing this or knowing this, that is, He knows everything of mine, nothing can be hidden from Him.&rdquo; Thus the living being is a finite entity and <I>Parama Pursus&#x301;a</I> is an infinite, endless entity. Through efforts a human being can know one &#133; two &#133; three &#133; four, even many things, but he cannot know the infinite.<!-- /block --></p>

That is, this <I>purus&#x301;a</I> is called the <I>maha&#x301;na</I> or greatest <I>pursus&#x301;a</I>, the original <I>purus&#x301;a</I>, the representative <I>purus&#x301;a</I>. The word <I>maha&#x301;na</I> comes from the word <I>mahat</I>. There is a slight difference between the words <I>mahat</I> and <I>brhat</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Often in Sanskrit the words <I>brhat</I> and <I>visha&#x301;la</I> are thought to be identical in meaning, however there is a difference between them. <I>Visha&#x301;la</I> means something which is very large but which can still be measured, for example, the Himalayan mountains. They are several thousand miles long but human beings can still measure them, so this huge mountain range is depicted in the maps of the Earth. But what is <I>brhat</I> is so huge that it cannot be measured. There is only one such entity and that entity is <I>brahma &ndash; brhatva&#x301;d brahma brm&#x301;han&#x301;attva&#x301;d brahma</I> [<I>brahma</I> is that which is great and which makes others great].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph --><I>Mahat</I> does not signify &ldquo;great&rdquo; from the standpoint of geographical area. It is a matter of the psychic world. <I>Brhat</I> is a matter of the external world, so what is great in the psychic world is called <I>mahat</I>. For example, I will call a person <I>mahat</I> who is short in stature but who has achieved great recognition in the world of knowledge, not <I>brhat</I>. So, here <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> is described as <I>maha&#x301;na agryapurus&#x301;a</I>.<!-- /block --></p>

But human beings themselves create certain diseases in their minds, and, seized by these diseases, they undergo suffering.

<a name="18..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->This <I>shloka</I> is a <I>rk</I> from the <I>Rgveda</I>&#146;s tenth <I>man&#x301;d&#x301;ala</I>, <I>purus&#x301;a su&#x301;kta</I>. This reminds me of something. If a <I>shloka</I> is from the <I>Rgveda</I> then it is called a <I>rk</I> rather than a <I>shloka</I>. This is a convention of the <I>Rgveda</I>. The singular is <I>rk</I> and the plural is <I>rca&#x301;</I>. Some mistakenly pluralize <I>rca&#x301;</I> and say <I>rca&#x301;yen&#x32D;</I> [in Hindi], but <I>rca&#x301;</I> is already a word with a plural ending. For example, many people pluralize the word <I>santa</I> and say <I>santon&#x32D;</I> [in Hindi]. This is incorrect because the word <I>santa</I> is itself plural. <I>Santon&#x32D;</I> means &ldquo;honest individuals&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->In the <I>shloka</I> it is said that <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> knows everything. <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> knows what has happened in the past, what is happening in the present and what will happen in the future. What does <I>Purus&#x301;a</I> mean? <I>Pure shete yah</I>, or <I>purasi shete yah sah Purus&#x301;a</I>, that is, he who is lying in the <I>pura</I> [city] of the body and observing everything is <I>Purus&#x301;a</I>. He is seeing everything but doing nothing. The second meaning is &ldquo;he who is lying in front&rdquo;, for example, <I>purasi hitam&#x301; karoti yah sah purohitah</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph --><I>Yadbhu&#x301;tam&#x301; yacca bhavyam</I>. The meaning of <I>purus&#x301;a</I> knowing everything is that whatever has been or will be is inside of him, not outside. Nothing exists outside him. Momentum comes from him. In the <I>rk</I> there is no mention whatsoever of the present. Now the question may arise: Does <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> only know the past and the future, and not the present? Here nothing is said about the present because actually there is no such thing as the present. For example, no one hears the words I am saying at this moment; they hear them slightly afterwards. When someone hears my words they are present for that person but for me they are in the past. We call something present when we are not aware of it being past or future, that is, we combine the two into one. What do we do then? We take a little chunk of the past and a little chunk of the future, join them together, and make the present. In actual fact this is not the present. There is no such thing as the present. For this reason there is no mention of the present in this <I>rk</I>. <I>Yadbhu&#x301;tam&#x301; yacca bhavyam</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph --><I>Uta&#x301;mrtasyesha&#x301;no</I>. <I>Uta</I> means &ldquo;hell&rdquo;. <I>Tala, atala, tala&#x301;tala, pa&#x301;ta&#x301;la, atipa&#x301;ta&#x301;la, rasa&#x301;tala</I> &ndash; <I></I>these are the different levels of hell. <I>Rasa&#x301;tala</I> is the lowest of them all. When a person has become completely degenerate then people say about them that they have gone to <I>rasa&#x301;tala</I>. Just as there are seven levels in the downward direction, there are also seven levels in the upward direction &ndash; <I>bhu&#x301;h, bhuvah, svah, mahah, janah, tapah</I>, and <I>satya</I>. Among these seven worlds, <I>svah</I> is heaven. And down below, the <I>pa&#x301;ta&#x301;la</I>, the imaginary <I>pa&#x301;ta&#x301;la</I>, is called hell. <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> is the master of heaven and He is also the master of hell. People want to be saved from hell. He who is the master of the mortal world is also present in hell. This is a complex question. In the same way, the immortal world is also arranged in seven levels &ndash; <I>bhu&#x301;h, bhuvah, svah, mahah, janah, tapah</I>, and <I>satya</I> <I>(vya&#x301;hrti: vi &ndash; a&#x301; &ndash; hr + ktin)</I>. <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> is the master of both heaven and hell. Now the thing is that these seven lower levels are not spatial entities. In the Vedas all these levels have been described: <I>Asu&#x301;rya&#x301;h na&#x301;ma te loka&#x301;h andhena tamasa&#x301;vrta&#x301;h</I> &ndash; &ldquo;Hell is the <I>asu&#x301;rya</I> world, that is, where the light of <I>su&#x301;rya</I> [sun] <I></I>cannot enter, that which remains always covered in profound darkness.&rdquo; It is where the darkness is so dense, so deep, that a person cannot even see himself. That kind of darkness is called <I>andhatamisra&#x301;</I>. And when a person cannot see someone else, then it is called <I>andhaka&#x301;r</I>. What is hell like? It is where there is no sun, that which is covered in <I>andhatamisra&#x301;</I>. That person who does not do spiritual practices moves in the direction of this world of darkness. This is the correct meaning of this <I>shloka</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph --><I>Uta</I> means &ldquo;hell&rdquo;, that is, the world of darkness. This world of darkness is arranged in six layers &ndash; <I>tamah, tamasa&#x301;, tamisra&#x301;, andhatamah, andhatamisra&#x301;</I>, and <I>andhatamasa&#x301;</I>. In the Upanis&#x301;ad it is said: <I>ta&#x301;m&#x301;ste pretya&#x301;bhigacchanti yeke ca&#x301;tmahano jana&#x301;h</I> [to which all will go who deny their own souls]. That world of darkness is called the <I>asu&#x301;rya</I> world. It is depicted as if from within that deep darkness even more darkness is vomited up. If one looks towards that deep darkness then it seems, as if, even a deeper darkness is tearing the heart of that darkness and coming out.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Now the question arises: whose movement is towards that darkness? It is the movement of that person or those persons who do not perform spiritual practices. <I>Ta&#x301;m&#x301;ste pretya&#x301;bhigacchanti</I>. Now <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> is present even in this world shrouded in profound darkness. Here the purport of the <I>shloka</I> is that since <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> is the master of both heaven and hell, He also has to go to hell from time to time to supervise or look after things.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph --><I>Tama&#x301;huragryam&#x301; purus&#x301;am&#x301; maha&#x301;ntam</I>. So this <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> is all-pervading, moving everywhere. He is present in the so-called heaven and in the world of darkness where the sun does not shine. How will you know Him? You do not even know why you have come to this earth. How will you know where He is hiding and what He is doing? But He knows what you are doing or thinking in secret. When we meditate on <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> we must think that <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> is taking me as the object of His cosmic mind; He is seeing me. One should have this kind of thought in one&#146;s mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->For this reason it is said: <I>sa vetti vedyam&#x301; na ca tasya&#x301;sti vetta&#x301; tama&#x301;huragryam&#x301; purus&#x301;am&#x301; maha&#x301;ntam</I>. That <I>Purus&#x301;a</I>, that is, <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I>, is called <I>agryapurus&#x301;a</I> or <I>maha&#x301;n</I>. <I>Agrya</I> means &ldquo;he who remains in the front or the forefront of everything&rdquo;. <I>Agryapurus&#x301;a</I> means &ldquo;representative <I>Purus&#x301;a</I>, best <I>Purus&#x301;a</I>, first <I>Purus&#x301;a</I>&rdquo;. What does <I>maha&#x301;n</I> mean? The first person singular of the word <I>mahat</I> is <I>maha&#x301;n</I>. In the Sanskrit language two very important words are <I>brhat</I><!-- fn --><a name="Ref.18.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#18.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> <I></I>and <I>mahat</I>. What is the fundamental difference between them? Similarly, two very similar words are <I>visha&#x301;la</I> and <I>brhat</I>. That which is very big but which can be measured is <I>visha&#x301;la</I>, for example, the Himalayas. They are nearly fifteen hundred miles in length but in spite of being extremely big they can be measured. We depict the Himalayas in our maps. And that which is so big that it cannot be measured, we call <I>mahat</I>. There is only one such entity that is so big that it cannot be measured, and what is that entity? Brahma. It is said: <I>brhattva&#x301;d brahma brm&#x301;han&#x301;atva&#x301;d brahma</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->So <I>brhat</I> means &ldquo;so big that it cannot be measured&rdquo;. And what does <I>mahat</I> mean? That which is not big in the physical sense but which is big or very big in the psychic sense is <I>mahat</I>. In other words, something which is <I>brhat</I> belongs to the external world, the world of the sense organs which we can see with our eyes, and that which belongs to the mental world, which cannot be perceived in the external world but which exerts a great influence over other things in the psychic sense, we call <I>mahat</I>. Take, for example, a renunciant who is small in stature but who possesses tremendous intellect and understanding. We will not call him or her <I>brhat</I>. Seen externally, he or she is a person of small size. Actually he or she is <I>maha&#x301;n</I>. For this reason, <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> is called <I>agryapurus&#x301;a</I> or <I>maha&#x301;n purus&#x301;a</I> in the Vedas.<!-- /block --></p>
