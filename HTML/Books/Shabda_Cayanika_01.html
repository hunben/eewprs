<a name="1..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->On the 8th of September, 1985, the author, and founder of Ananda Marga, Shrii Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar, began an extraordinary series of Sunday lectures in his native Bengali that would eventually fill a total of twenty-six volumes over the next five years. The title he gave to this series was Shabda Cayanika&#x301;, which translates into English as &ldquo;A Collection of Words&rdquo;. As the title suggests, each discourse consists of a discussion of a certain number of words from the Bengali language, beginning, in the first discourse, with the first letter of the Bengali alphabet, a, and continuing on alphabetically. What results, then, is neither an encyclopedia, nor a dictionary, but something unique to the fields of scholarship and literature.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Ostensibly, Shabda Cayanika&#x301; is a series devoted to the linguistics and philology of the Bengali language, but in reality it is much more than that. The author uses the platform of the word as a point of departure to take the reader on a journey through all the varied landscapes of human knowledge &ndash; history, geography, medicine, science, art, religion, philosophy, etc. &ndash; and in the process adds the indelible stamp of his own unique intellect, enriching our experience with new ideas and enabling us to see our human heritage in a way we have never been able to before.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Like most great authors, he is a consummate storyteller, using a seemingly inexhaustible supply of anecdotes, personal experiences and stories to capture the reader&#146;s interest and lead him or her effortlessly through the garden of human knowledge. Along the way the author refines and develops a language that is the world&#146;s fifth most widely spoken and the closest living language to its great classical ancestor, Sanskrit.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Footnotes by the translators have all been signed &ldquo;&ndash;Trans.&rdquo; Unsigned footnotes are those of the author.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Square brackets [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;] in the text are used to indicate translations by the translators or other editorial insertions. Round brackets (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) indicate a word or words originally given by the author.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->The author uses a certain shorthand for explaining etymologies of words. Under this system, a minus sign (&ndash;) follows a prefix, and a plus sign (+) precedes a suffix. Thus ava &ndash; tr + ghain&#x32D; = avata&#x301;ra can be read, &ldquo;the root tr prefixed by ava and suffixed by ghain&#x32D; becomes avata&#x301;ra.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->The first English publication of the material on hysteria in the section entitled &ldquo;Acetana&rdquo; appeared in The Awakening of Women, 1995. The passage was translated by A&#x301;ca&#x301;rya Vijaya&#x301;nanda Avadhu&#x301;ta, Shrii Deva&#x301;shiis&#x301;a, Avadhu&#x301;tika&#x301; A&#x301;nanda Rucira&#x301; A&#x301;ca&#x301;rya&#x301; and A&#x301;ca&#x301;rya Acyuta&#x301;nanda Avadhu&#x301;ta.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Many thanks to Avadhu&#x301;tika&#x301; A&#x301;nanda Rucira&#x301; A&#x301;ca&#x301;rya&#x301; for her invaluable assistance with layout and indexing.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="2..1"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->A<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Among all mundane expressions, the sound a plays the chief role. In different layers, expressed or unexpressed, we find the a sound predominant. Just as one name of Prakrti is Pradha&#x301;na [Chief], so can we call the science of sound a-a&#x301;dha&#x301;rita [based on a].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The sound a is the original seed of the creation. The mantra of creation, a, is gradually transformed into the mantra of preservation, u. And this mantra of preservation, u, gradually, with the passage of time, loses it momentum and sinks down into the final inertness [[of ma]]. But this is not the end of expression. Again, there is a new awakening, a new arising. That also happens through a; it is the play of that same a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The seed of creation, a, is the first sound, the first letter of the alphabet. When we put together the first letter of the alphabet, a, and the last letter, ks&#x301;a, we get the aks&#x301;ama&#x301;la&#x301; [alphabet] which is also known as the varn&#x301;ama&#x301;la&#x301; [the garland of letters].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Aks&#x301;a means &ldquo;to delineate&rdquo;. That is why, in Sanskrit, we use aks&#x301;a&#x301;m&#x301;sha for the English word &ldquo;latitude&rdquo;. One sound gradually gets lost and within the melody of that loss is born another sound. A is the hidden source of all words and all sounds in this elliptical expressed universe.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->The creation had arisen, sound had permeated the firmament, but in the unit body, the unit mind, the vibration of sound had not yet come &ndash; there was such an age. In that age ideas were expressed with the help of gestures; this still continues today in the case of mute creatures and insects for the purpose of channelizing their internal feeling and realization towards others through their rhythmic flows of acquired experience.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Even after the advent of language, gestures remained. They are there today and will remain forever. As thought procedes step by step towards greater subtlety, the intellect evolves a sharper language and subtler and subtler gestures &ndash; and it will go on doing so. Even today, when we want to show that it is hot we move our hand in a fan-like motion. When we want to show we are thirsty, we cup our palms and use a water-drinking gesture. At one time this was indispensable because the support of language was missing.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Movement is the dharma of the universe, both of the unit and of the collective. The creation is sustained in the rhythm of movement. Thus one name for the play of creation is jagat (gam + kvip = jagat), &ldquo;that whose nature is to move&rdquo;; another name is sam&#x301;sa&#x301;ra (sam&#x301; &ndash; sr + ghain&#x32D; = sam&#x301;sa&#x301;ra) or &ldquo;that which gradually moves away&rdquo;. In this movement is hidden the measure of life, the grandeur of existence. The more one&#146;s existence is vibrant with noble deeds, the more that existence is unique and splendid. But it is important to note that the old root verbs for &ldquo;move&rdquo; began with a vowel &ndash; either a or one of its closely related sounds. In the very ancient language, ejati was often used in place of gacchati; besides this, we also see the roots yati (i-a&#x301;-ti), at&#x301;ati, and so on. Similar roots were aj and an &ndash; in both of these, movement and the possibility of movement were understood. The primordial phase (pre-embryonic stage) of creation was indicated by the root an.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->The modern root cal originated much later, in the middle of the Vedic era. The root cal signifies &ldquo;motion&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;advancement&rdquo;. Thus, in differing circumstances it was used as both parasmaepadii and a&#x301;tmanepadii<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.2.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#2.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> (in modern Sanskrit its a&#x301;tmanepadii form has almost completely disappeared). Anyhow, when we add the suffix shatr to the root cal in paraesmaepadii we get the word calat which means &ldquo;that which goes on moving&rdquo;. And if the root cal is used in a&#x301;tmanepadii we get calama&#x301;na (cal + sha&#x301;nac) which also means &ldquo;that which is in a state of motion&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->The root an is more frequently used than cal. Its primary meaning is &ldquo;to move&rdquo; or &ldquo;to come and go&rdquo;. When we add the suffix an&#x301;d&#x301;ac to an we get the word an&#x301;d&#x301;a [egg] which means &ldquo;that which moves about unseen and becomes active when it comes into the open&rdquo;. The suffix an&#x301;d&#x301;ac is commonly used to imply something whose nature is hidden.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Thus, the etymological meaning of the word an&#x301;d&#x301;a is &ldquo;that which is on the path of movement or emergence or expression&rdquo;. The Cosmic citta or done &ldquo;I&rdquo; of the Supreme Entity is dominant as the causal factor and subordinate as the effect, thus it is the creation&#146;s primordial manifestation. That conscious entity imbibes both possibilities, that of cause and that of effect, and thus the second stage is indicative of equality, that is, the causal factor and the effect factor maintain a state of equipoise or harmony, and the final or supreme state is subordinate in cause and dominant in effect, that is, where the causal factor dissolves into the effect, the effect is imbedded in the causal a, this is the third stage, the state of supreme negativity. That manifestation, or movement which emerges from the Great, that is, the all-expressive kaos&#x301;ikii bindu [primordial point] &ndash; is the first qualified stage of vibration of that Supreme entity. Thus a is the original sound, the first seed, and it is the first manifestation of alphabetic expression. The first letter of the alphabet is a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->When the Great Entity, Brahma, is bound by a, then the word brahma&#x301; (brahma + a = brahma&#x301;) is used. Brahma&#x301; is not a separate state from the trinity of Brahma&#x301;, Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u and Shiva &ndash; it is the first stage of expression of the Supreme Consciousness where the causal factor is dominant in that cognitive bearing and the effect factor is only mildly expressed.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->In the world of living creatures, those beings which are hatched from eggs we call an&#x301;d&#x301;aj [omniparous]. This an&#x301;d&#x301;a is conceptually analagous to the brahma&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;a [the created universe, literally &ldquo;the cosmic egg&rdquo;]; they are small editions of the brahma&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;a. The Sanskrit-derived form of the word an&#x301;d&#x301;a, an&#x301;d&#x301;a&#x301;,<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.2.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#2.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> is prevalent throughout north India. Brahma&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;a (cosmic egg)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->It is not possible for creatures of the reptile group, that is, those who move by supporting themselves on their chest or ribcage, to carry a developed fetus in the womb. For this reason they carry eggs in their wombs. Though birds are technically not reptiles, when they fly they use their wings to cut through the air thereby putting a great deal of pressure on their chest. Due to this it is also not possible for them to carry a developed fetus in the womb and so they also carry and lay eggs.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Once an egg is layed, the embryo starts developing under the impetus provided by the egg&#146;s contact with air, light and heat from the environment. When the developing fetus is fully mobile it pierces its shell and emerges into the outside world where it needs more heat than is normally present in the environment, so the mother bird or mother reptile helps the fetus develop by supplying warmth from her own body. Of course, not all creatures hatched from eggs require this extra heat. In such cases the mother abandons the egg once it is layed. In accordance with nature&#146;s law, it does not feel any instinctive affection for the egg. For those eggs which require extra heat, however, it is the law of nature that the mother feels an instinctive affection for the egg. If someone comes and takes the egg she will often chase after them.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Because egg-producing creatures need their chest and ribs for labour, it is not possible for them to breast-feed their offspring. Thus oviparous creatures do not produce breast milk; this is the natural law. Exceptions to this can be found in certain creatures from an earlier era when reptiles were making the transition to non-reptiles, becoming creatures who moved by means of their hands and feet. During that time some creatures were in an intermediate stage; for several hundred thousand years they continued to lay eggs, but at the same time they used to breast-feed their offspring in small amounts. Later, when they stopped laying eggs and started bearing their young, the amount of milk they fed their offspring increased.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Among the creatures we are familiar with, the cow family produces the greatest amount of milk for their offspring. They are also comparatively more intelligent than other creatures and they show more affection for their offspring. Interestingly, they cannot run very swiftly, while the deer group, which produces very little milk and shows less affection for their offspring, can run extremely fast. The antelope family (bharal (niilgai), alpaca, black antelope) falls somewhere in between the deer and cow families in all respects, including their size, their horns and their tails, even their excretory systems.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Bear in mind that while the word niilga&#x301;i is similar to ga&#x301;i [cow], it is not a member of the cow family, nor is it a member of the deer family. It belongs to the antelope family. We often fall into the error of thinking that certain animals are either in the cow family or in the deer family when actually they are part of the antelope family. We can use the word go-harin [cow-deer] for the antelope family.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->That rare member of the cat family known as the duckbill, which is found in Southeast Asia and certain parts of Australia, is a nearly extinct prehistoric creature. Though this fast-disappearing creature lays eggs, it also breast-feeds its offspring. Because it uses its chest area more for locomotion and other activities in comparison with other milk-producing creatures, it continues to lay eggs. But in comparison with reptiles and birds, it uses its chest less, and so can still breast-feed its children. Proper efforts should be made to save the duckbill from extinction.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Among the aquatic creatures, fish are oviparous, the reason being that the way fish cut through water when they move is somewhat similar to the way reptiles slither along the ground or the way birds cut through the air. Thus, in the broader sense, they can also be considered reptiles. They also use their chest and ribs a great deal and so are unable to carry developed offspring<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.2.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#2.fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> in their womb or breast-feed their young. Thus, according to the law of nature, they produce eggs.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->There are other aquatic creatures, such as whales, seals and walruses, which use their chests and ribs less in their movements than fish do. Most probably, the whale was also once a land animal like the dolphin. Later, under the pressure of circumstance, they took to the water. Like the hilsa and the shark, they are not ancient aquatic creatures. Though they live in water they are not a species of fish. To call a whale a fish is a gross error. Therefore such creatures bear their young, breast-feed their offspring and, according to the natural law, have more affection for their progeny.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->In other words, we see that those egg-producing creatures which do not incubate their eggs, also show no affection towards them. Those which incubate their eggs show comparively more affection, and those creatures which bear their young and breast-feed them will even, in certain cases, not stop at sacrificing their lives for their offspring.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->The crocodile is a land reptile &ndash; an ancient species from the Cretaceous age. Generally speaking, all members of this family are terrestrial by nature and all are egg-producing. The crocodile, fish-eating crocodile (mecho-kumiir), iguana (Gosa&#x301;p. In Sanskrit godha&#x301; or godhika&#x301;, in indigenous Bengali goha&#x301;r&#x301;gil, goh, gosa&#x301;p), girgit&#x301;i [a type of lizard], t&#x301;ikt&#x301;iki [a small house lizard], taks&#x301;aka [a poisonous snake] (the word guisa&#x301;p is used in East Bengal), a&#x301;njuni [also a type of lizard] &ndash; all these egg-producing creatures have a similar nature; they differ only in their level of cruelty. The man-eating crocodile is extremely ferocious. The rest of these creatures are also ferocious with the exception, to some extent, of the iguana which, despite being a meat-eater, has a somewhat timid nature. When they see people they will flee if they have someplace to run. The Indian iguana is predominantly of two types: the black iguana and the golden iguana, both of which share this timid nature.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->While it is true that the otter (in Sanskrit, udbir&#x301;a&#x301;la [water-lion]) goes into water to catch fish, it is a land animal like the crocodile. Otters live near ponds or other water resevoirs, and they are milk-producing, not egg-producing. The Bengalee otter is somewhat smaller than the South American otter but it is more active and highly intelligent. Because it is a milk-producing creature, not egg-producing, it is, according to the law of nature, relatively keen-witted.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->Normally, we observe that the young of any species are not fully developed at the time of birth. Whether human, dog, or cat, all are born in a helpless state, unable to hear or see. This helpless state is even more pronounced in egg-producing creatures. When tadpoles are hatched they cannot move properly. They need a tail in order to adjust with their environment. After adapting to their environment the tail falls off. From this we can deduce that the ancestors of the frog had tails.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.2.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#2.fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->However undeveloped milk-producing animals may be, egg-producing animals are even more so; by comparison they also show significantly less affection as well as other sentiments. Many do not even recognize their own children; those who do not hatch their eggs feel little or no affection and tend to be much more malicious by nature.

<a name="2..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->Another characteristic of the carnivorous egg-producing animals is that their bodies have a high fat content and give off a strong odour. Those who are familiar with the hilsa fish know how strong a fish-smell it has. The reason for this is that the hilsa prefers rotten meat to fresh meat. The shark is the same way. It also has a very strong fish smell. People who eat shark often remark that it is similar to hilsa. It also has a high fat content. In fact, shark oil is used as a medicine (bear in mind that the shark is a fish, not a crustacean like crab or shrimp). The vulture&#146;s nature is quite similar. It prefers decomposed flesh to fresh meat.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="2..30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->Before the fetus is created, milk-producing animals produce an ovum in the mother&#146;s womb. Rather than producing an egg, however, a fetus develops. In the world of egg-producing creatures, especially birds, there are exceptions to this. Some of them can produce fetus-less or unfertilized eggs. Some varieties of ducks, especially, frequently lay unfertilized eggs. With such eggs there is no possiblity of offspring, even if they are incubated. Commonly such eggs take longer to spoil. Many people who have a weakness for eggs, but do not want to harm a living embryo, are partial to taking unfertilized eggs; they contend that this way they are not killing a fetus. They should keep in mind that while it is true that they are not killing a fetus, they are still at fault for taking non-vegetarian food, because these unfertilized eggs still contain the defects of non-vegetarian food.<!-- /block --></p>

Just as rajaka and rain&#x32D;jaka are not identical, neither are s&#x301;aka and n&#x301;aka.

Seeing mountains flying around this way, Indra, the king of the gods, became scared that some flying mountain might choose to land on his throne, making him king of heaven instead.

<a name="2..89"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=89 type=paragraph -->The fundamental meaning of the word agha is &ldquo;sharp-witted&rdquo;, especially someone who possesses a keen but crooked intellegence. You must have heard that in King Kam&#x301;sa&#146;s time there was a man in Shu&#x301;rasena named Agha&#x301;sura who was a very clever but evil man.

<a name="2..91"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=91 type=paragraph -->The terrifying form of Shiva is called Aghoranatha. Aghoriis or those that follow the path of Aghora are generally Va&#x301;ma&#x301;ca&#x301;rii Tantrics [Tantrics of the left-hand path]. None of them are Madhyama&#x301;ca&#x301;rii [Tantrics of the middle path] or Daks&#x301;in&#x301;a&#x301;ca&#x301;rii [Tantrics of the right-hand path]. It is said that they do not discriminate between edible and non-edible food. For this reason many people are afraid of them and try to avoid them. It would not be correct to say that all Va&#x301;ma&#x301;ca&#x301;rii Tantrics are Avidya&#x301; Tantrics. Among them one will find both Vidya&#x301; Tantrics and Avidya&#x301; Tantrics. Towards the end of the Buddhist era, this Aghora path could be found alongside the Vajraya&#x301;na and Ka&#x301;lacakraya&#x301;na. Some people believe that when the Vajraya&#x301;na and Ka&#x301;lacakraya&#x301;na fell under the influence of Hinduism, the Aghora path certainly also fell under that same influence, but this is not so. Though the Aghora path does not follow the Buddhist doctrine, neither are its followers, followers of the Vedas. Rather they are clearly opposed to the Vedas. In Hindi and throughout north India, the followers of Aghora are called aoghar&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="2..93"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=93 type=paragraph -->In ancient times, when a word was made by adding the suffix ac after a verb, then the a was joined to the preceding letter. In subsequent times, when an effort was made to fix the gender of a word according to its suffix, masculine gender words which ended with the suffix ac were placed within the jurisdiction of the suffix al. Those which were not considered masculine in gender, or those which were adjectives and those whose gender was determined according to the gender of the noun created from that adjective, were given the suffix ap. This became a rule referred to as ghainalao pum&#x301;si.<!-- /block --></p>

For example, alamativista&#x301;ren&#x301;a means: &ldquo;to expand more is futile&rdquo;, &ldquo;to say more is meaningless&rdquo;. Here the word vista&#x301;ra is in the third case-ending.

The one exception among the north Indian languages is Gorkhalii in which d&#x301;im [egg] is called phul [flower]. In spoken Bengali, that which takes shelter in the mother&#146;s womb in creatures who are not produced from eggs, is also called phul. When the child is born, the flower blossoms.</p>

<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="2.fn5"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.2.fn5">5</a></b>)  In the construction of khendi [snub-nosed], i is used because someone can only be kha&#x301;nda&#x301; or khendi by birth. Kha&#x301;nda&#x301;&#146;s wife is never called khendi in this sense. If she was it would be written khendii. Because they are related by birth, didi [elder sister], ma&#x301;si [maternal aunt], pisi [paternal aunt] and similar words use i, while in-laws such as kakii [paternal uncle&#146;s wife] and ma&#x301;mii [maternal uncle&#146;s wife] use ii because they are not only feminine gender but feminine as well.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="2.fn6"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.2.fn6">6</a></b>)  In Sanskrit the sound is hulu [a sound that Hindu women make during auspicious occasions]. I have heard certain pandits from Kerala use the word mukhava&#x301;dyam also. The ancestors of Kerala&#146;s Na&#x301;ya&#x301;rs came to Kerala from Rarh in the year 534 BCE. Thus, like Bengal, the custom of making the ulu sound is also prevalent there as well. In some Bengalee villages the practise of doing ulu is also called joka&#x301;r deoya&#x301;. In ancient Bengal, people used to make this sound during auspicious functions in order to protect against anyone present who might have been thinking harmful thoughts; in other words, it was used for all auspicious undertakings.</p>

<a name="3..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Here the sound a is used as a negation. The etymological meaning of acala is &ldquo;that which does not move&rdquo;. Its colloquial meaning is &ldquo;tree&rdquo;, or &ldquo;mountain&rdquo;. It is worth remembering that in ancient times people were familiar with the verbal root cal primarily as a&#x301;tmanepadii, while in later days it became parasmaepadii; in other words, the verb cala&#x301; can be used in both ways. Although during the time of the composition of grammar, the a&#x301;tmanepadii use of the verbal root cal was abolished, still the a&#x301;tmanepadii form was accepted for both padiis. If we can say that the verbal root cal was not used as a&#x301;tmanepadii in ordinary Sanskrit, then it is even more true of the spoken language. In the literary language it existed in name only. Since it was accepted as both padiis, then by adding the suffix shatr to the verbal root cal we get calat which means &ldquo;that which is moving&rdquo;. Thus: calat + citra = calaccitra; calat + shakti = calacchakti; jijiivis&#x301;et + shatam&#x301; sama&#x301;h = jijiivis&#x301;ecchatam&#x301; sama&#x301;h; tat + shubhram = tacchrubhram; tadyacchet + sha&#x301;nta&#x301;tmani = tadyaccheccha&#x301;nta&#x301;tmani. And by adding the suffix sha&#x301;nac we get the word calama&#x301;na which is equally correct. Thus, acala means aga [unmoving].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The practical value of money depends on its mobility. If no one will accept it due to some defect in its structure or lack of value then its motion gets halted.  For this reason, fake [nakala] or counterfeit [meki] money is called acala t&#x301;a&#x301;ka&#x301;, acala mudra&#x301;, or acala paysa&#x301; [non-moving money]. One should keep in mind that in this case, the word acala comes from Sanskrit and t&#x301;a&#x301;ka&#x301; is indigenous Bengali.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The words nakala and meki are of foreign origin. Meki mudra means &ldquo;counterfeit coin&rdquo; in English. Keep an eye on the spelling here. &ldquo;I&rdquo; comes after &ldquo;e&rdquo;. The usual rule is &ldquo;i&rdquo; before &ldquo;e&rdquo; but there are certain exceptions or apava&#x301;da such as &ldquo;counterfeit&rdquo;, &ldquo;leisure&rdquo; and the root &ldquo;ceive&rdquo; (its noun is &ldquo;ceipt&rdquo;) &ndash; &ldquo;receive&rdquo;, &ldquo;deceive&rdquo;, &ldquo;conceive&rdquo;, &ldquo;perceive&rdquo;, and so forth. Such exceptions are called apava&#x301;da in Sanskrit. Va&#x301;da means &ldquo;fundamental idea&rdquo;. The prefix apa means &ldquo;opposing&rdquo;, the prefix upa means &ldquo;near&rdquo;, and the prefix ava commonly means &ldquo;lower&rdquo;. That which opposes the basic means of expression is apava&#x301;da. For example, words ending with di or dhi and suffixed by ki are masculine. We call this expression va&#x301;da but the word dadhi is an exception; it is neuter. Rather than calling it an exception, we can say that it goes against the prevalent rule, that is, it is the apava&#x301;da of va&#x301;da. In Bengali, however, the original meaning of apava&#x301;da has been lost. It is now used to mean &ldquo;abuse&rdquo; or &ldquo;harsh words&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="3..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->It is important to remain aware of the difference between aca&#x301;ra [pickle] and a&#x301;ca&#x301;ra [conduct]. A&#x301;ca&#x301;ra is a Sanskrit word which is used in Bengali; it means &ldquo;behaviour&rdquo; (a&#x301;caran&#x301;a). A&#x301; &ndash; car + ghain&#x32D; = a&#x301;ca&#x301;ra. A&#x301; &ndash; car + anat&#x301; = a&#x301;caran&#x301;a. Aca&#x301;ra, however, is a foreign word &ndash; it was brought by the Portuguese approximately 450 years ago. The people of this country learned how to make aca&#x301;ra from them and thereafter increased its scope. Mango, green jackfruit, lemon, hog-plum, chillies, bamboo shoots, cauliflower, cabbage, kohlrabi, radish, myrobalan, kar&#x301;a&#x301;ishunt&#x301;i, karamca&#x301;, ka&#x301;mara&#x301;un&#x32D;ga&#x301; &ndash; from what is aca&#x301;ra not made? A&#x301;ca&#x301;ra helps in digestion and is tasty besides.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->The Indian people not only learned how to make aca&#x301;ra from the Portuguese, but also jam, jelly, marmalade, conserves, syrup, and yeasted breads; this apprenticeship began in their main centre, Goa, as well as in Hoogli and Bonadel. Bonadel means &ldquo;good area&rdquo;. The word bonadel, as it spread orally, became bandel in some places (Hoogli district) and bondel in others (Calcutta, 24th Paragan&#x301;a&#x301;). If care is not taken in spelling then a&#x301;ca&#x301;ra can be easily confused with aca&#x301;ra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->The renowned Agra jam in north India and Bengal&#146;s Suri jam did not exist before the Portuguese arrived in this country.

<a name="3..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->The etymological meaning of cyuta is &ldquo;that which falls off or drops away after reaching full maturity or completeness&rdquo;. Thus, etymologically, almost all fruits (palmyra fruit, mango, coconut, ja&#x301;m [Indian blackberry]) fall in the category of cyuta because they fall off the tree when they become fully ripe, but colloquially cyuta refers to sweet mango, coconut, palmyra fruit, bellfruit. The etymological meaning of acyuta is &ldquo;that which does not fall off or drop off&rdquo; &ndash; that which does not deviate from its own nature or its own dharma. It has achieved the fullness of its nature.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->That vaes&#x301;n&#x301;avii ma&#x301;ya&#x301; which looks after and cares for the created universe also never deviates from its own nature or its dharma. When Parama Brahma [Supreme Entity] acts as the preserver then it is called Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u. This Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u never deviates from its path or fails in its duty. From beginninglessness to endlessness, all falls within the periphery of His duty. If Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u would forget His duty for even a second, the entire universe would collapse. This rhythmic expression of Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u is called acyuta. Brahma&#x301;, the creator, could put an end to this universal play, He could withdraw it back into annihilation; still Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u would continue His work of preserving and maintaining without a pause. Thus, from the supreme spiritual standpoint, acyuta stands for Supreme Consciousness&#146; Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u form whose seed syllable is u.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="3..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Cit + lyut&#x301; = cetana. By adding the negation a it becomes acetana.  The verbal root cit means &ldquo;to perceive&rdquo;, &ldquo;to discriminate&rdquo;, &ldquo;to cogitate&rdquo;, &ldquo;to contemplate&rdquo;. (By adding the suffix kta after the verbal root cit we get the word citta). The word cetana is used in different senses. It means &ldquo;one who has awakened&rdquo;, &ldquo;who is alive&rdquo;, &ldquo;who has developed intellect&rdquo;, &ldquo;who is spiritually awakened&rdquo;, &ldquo;who is discriminating&rdquo;, &ldquo;whose power of judgement is developed&rdquo;, and so forth. Although the word cetana has many meanings, normally we use it in three ways. Needless to say, we also use acetana primarily in three ways.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->If, for any reason, in the world of physicality, the nerve fibres are injured and due to this the nerve cells lose their normal abiltity to function, then that temporary loss of function we refer to in colloquial Bengali as ajin&#x32D;a&#x301;na haye yaoya&#x301; [becoming unconscious] or jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na ha&#x301;ra&#x301;no [becoming senseless] for which the word acetana is also used. In many cases the nerve cells, rather than the nerve fibres, receive a blow. If the mind is agitated by some extremely pleasurable or extremely painful event, it can cause a psychic stupor which prevents the nerve fibres from functioning normally. As a result, the person becomes senseless. For this reason, one should not break any very painful or very pleasurable news to a person suddenly. It should be done slowly, step by step. The nerve fibres should also<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.3.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#3.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> not be given any sudden, heavy blow. One should be socially considerate in this regard.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->If an unmarried daughter suffers humiliation from relatives and neighbours over a long period of time, then the pressure of that mental suffering can one day affect her nerve cells and render her senseless or take the form of a disease. This is commonly called hysteria. If the cause of suffering is removed then the disease also disappears. In those societies where the remarriage of widows is forbidden hysteria is common for this very reason. In colloquial Bengali we call this phit&#x301; haowa&#x301; [fainting].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->One should keep in mind that spirit possession and fainting are not the same thing. In possession a person mumbles incoherently. In this case he or she does not or cannot control his or her mental pabula and expresses his or her mind without any awareness of time, place or person. Hysteria is different.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Anyway this hysteria is a form of acetanata&#x301; [senselessness]. Epilepsy is also transmitted from the psychic level, that is, from the nerve cells to the nerve fibres. But this disease first occurs in the nerve fibres and then agitates the nerve cells. After this, it remains imprinted in the nerve cells as a psychic disease and expresses itself in a particular place and time. These are the different kinds of senselessness that we observe or find in the mundane world.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Epilepsy arises when a person comes in sudden contact with some thing or some event completely outside the realm of his or her experience. Through proper counselling, attacks of this disease can be checked and through psychic treatment along with the use of small amounts of medicine the disease can be treated. Anyhow, in all the above cases we use the word acetana.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->In the psychic world we use the word acetana in yet another way. Though from the spiritual standpoint it is not absolutely true, still we commonly divide the mind into three layers of which one is the acetana [unconscious] mind. Its scope is extremely vast but it functions entirely within that vast periphery. The second layer is the avacetana [subconscious] mind whose scope is comparatively much smaller but which functions partly within those boundaries and partly outside them. The third layer is the cetana [conscious] mind whose scope is extremely limited but which functions primarily outside those boundaries with the help of the ten sensory and motor organs. In those extremely few cases where it functions within its boundaries, its action consists of contemplation born of experience.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Ten sensory and motor organs and the faculty of contemplation &ndash; this is its domain. For this reason, many people are of the opinion that there are eleven indriyas. In social life and in individual life, for one&#146;s sake or for other&#146;s, that person&#146;s life becomes exalted and sublime who is able to enrich his or her conscious mind&#146;s creations with the wealth of the subconcious mind, and one&#146;s all-round existence becomes successful when one is able to saturate one&#146;s conscious mind with the riches of the subconcious mind, and the subconscious mind with the treasures of the unconscious mind. Within this is hidden the supreme spiritual inspiration of one&#146;s existence and the complete fufilment of desire.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->From the spiritual point of view, the essence of the all-imaginative ectoplasm is known as the Cognitive Faculty or the Cognitive Entity, regardless whether it is expressed or unexpressed. That essence or flow of the individual movement is the causal matrix of its arising. Within the crude manifestation of this conciousness in the unit inheres the fundamental substantiation of its existence &ndash; the establishment of the sense of doership &ndash; and in its ultimate transformation it becomes the faculty of discrimination.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->This Cognitive Faculty which lies in the seed of expression remains associated with all manifest entities during every step of the process of manifestation, and it remains as the witness of all entities whether they are expressed or unexpressed. When it remains associated with each individual entity separately it is known as Pratyaga&#x301;tma&#x301; and when it remains associated with them collectively as the Cognitive Entity, it is known as Paracaetanya. When the knowership of the Cognitive Faculty remains associated with matter, that is to say, when it remains associated in such a way that there is no realization of existence, nor the capacity for doership or active experience, then that state of matter we call acetana or crude matter; everything else is cetana.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->The manifestation of consciousness (cetanata&#x301;) is greatest where the sense of existence is most pronounced. For this reason human beings are considered the most developed beings. But is there anything more to the human being&#8230; does this exhaust his potential? No. The sweetness of this sense of existence is hidden in the glory of its expansion. It is their existential greatness and its unhindered radiation that makes human beings great. Thus, in another sense, when we say &ldquo;conscious entity&rdquo; we mean human being.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->In the waking, dream and deep-sleep states, spiritual consciousness permeates the microcosm but in the living being it happens mostly in the waking state, very little in the dream state, and virtually not at all in deep sleep. But the wonder of it is that the same being that considers the waking state the final, supreme truth also considers the dream state as the final and supreme truth as long as he or she is dreaming. Deep sleep is the state of the experience of nothingness. Thus, despite the impossibility of calling this supreme or final, after waking from this deep sleep one falls into the error of thinking of this recent experience of absence as supreme and final. Actually, the dream state is a combination of subtle experiences collected from the mental world and vibrations collected from the waking state. Those vibrations which are gathered from the crude world oscillate constantly between truth and untruth, but those which come from the mental world are sometimes relative and sometimes non-relative truth. There is little opportunity for vibrational movement in the conviction of absence realized in deep sleep but we cannot reject this as non-existence.  Anyhow, all this happens in the flow of consciousness, sometimes in a very natural, and sometimes in an unnatural rhythmic flow. This was consciousness or its negative, unconsciousness.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->We were speaking about the waking state, dream state, and deep sleep, which reminds me of a little-known face. It was the year 1938 or 1939. At the time I was about seventeen or eighteen.

<a name="3..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->I was travelling from Calcutta to Patna by night train. Travelling by day would have been a waste of my time, but by taking the night train I was not losing any time because if I was not in the train I would still have to sleep, regardless of whether I was in Calcutta or Patna. Thus by taking the night train I avoided spoiling my time.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->It was wintertime. The compartment I boarded was quite crowded at the beginning, but half the people got off in Burdwan and the rest in Asansol. After Asansol I had the compartment to myself. I lay down and covered myself, and fell asleep not long after.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->Suddenly, about 2:30 in the morning, I heard someone whispering in my ear in a sweet, gentle voice.  He seemed to be saying, &ldquo;Excuse me, please. Could I borrow your lighter?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->A little annoyed, I pulled the blanket down from around my face and saw a young gentleman about my age in a coat and pants. At that time nobody liked to wear pants. Police, excise inspectors and military personnel had to wear pants as part of their uniform and gazetted officers had to wear pants for their work, but as soon as they got the chance they would switch to a dhoti and pain&#x32D;ja&#x301;bii. Doctors at that time used to wear either pants or dhoti. School boys used to wear half-pants, but as soon as they reached college age they would start wearing dhoti and pain&#x32D;ja&#x301;bii. During my time, many boys in the higher grades of high school also wore dhoti and pain&#x32D;ja&#x301;bii. That was the style in that era.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->I was somewhat astonished to see this young man standing there wearing pants, but I guessed that he must have been a gazetted officer. His countenance bore an imprint of gentleness and nobility.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="3..33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->Amazingly enough, there was. I was completely dumbfounded. There actually was a lighter in my pocket.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->When I handed it to him he smiled sweetly and said, &ldquo;I put the lighter in your pocket. It was a pretext to talk to you. I hope you didn&#146;t mind?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->I asked him to sit. A tornado was tearing full speed through my mind. I had locked the door, so how did my visitor get in? I was sleeping on my right side, so my right pocket was underneath me. How did he put the lighter in there? After a short stoppage at Sitarampur there was no other stoppage until Jashidi Junction. Did this fellow hop on a moving train?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..36"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph -->My visitor appeared as if he had heard everything I was thinking and smiled in such a way that left no doubt about it.

<a name="3..37"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=37 type=paragraph -->For a time there was complete silence. Outside it was completely dark and other than the sound of the train there did not seem to be anything else existing. The sound of the crickets blended with the sound of the train to make a single sound as the train rolled past the undulating land of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. I asked this polite, mannerly, quiet young man, &ldquo;Where is your home? Where are you coming from? Where do you stay?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..38"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=38 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;I&#146;m from Dhaka city, at Ramna, near Kaliibari,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I&#146;m working in Calcutta.&rdquo; (This was nine or ten years before the partition of the country). Smiling a little, he said, &ldquo;Don&#146;t you know that I&#146;m very close to you? I&#146;m just a little younger than you are. You should use tumi and not a&#x301;pni [the familiar rather than the polite form of address].&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..39"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=39 type=paragraph -->So I said [using the familiar form], &ldquo;Then you&#146;re staying in Calcutta now.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..40"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=40 type=paragraph -->He smiled. &ldquo;Yes, but for the time being I&#146;m in this compartment.&rdquo; I also started smiling with him.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..41"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=41 type=paragraph -->He continued talking: &ldquo;I was thinking that you didn&#146;t get a chance to eat properly because you had to catch the evening train, so I kept some food for you. I wanted to give it to you when the crowd thinned out. I didn&#146;t let just anybody cook it; I cooked it with my own hands, so I wouldn&#146;t hear of you not taking it. I was going to give it to you myself but it was so crowded that I didn&#146;t get a chance. Moreover, I was thinking for a long time that I wanted the chance to meet you. After the train emptied out in Asansol I thought to come and see you, but I noticed that you had lain down with a blanket over you and fallen asleep.  One shouldn&#146;t just wake somebody up like that. If I did wake you up under those circumstances to give you something to eat, it wouldn&#146;t exactly be wrong, but I didn&#146;t do it. About 2:30 I noticed that you were sleeping lighter and then I took the opportunity to wake you up on the pretext of wanting your lighter. Now I can see that waking you up was a great injustice; it won&#146;t do to give you food at 2:30 in the morning.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..42"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=42 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;You didn&#146;t tell me your name,&rdquo; I said.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..43"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=43 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;My name is Madhumalay Mitra,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;In the morning also, I won&#146;t have a chance to sit beside you and give you breakfast.

<a name="3..44"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=44 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;Mokama ghat is also on the Ganges.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="3..47"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=47 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;You know so much!&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..48"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=48 type=paragraph -->Madhumalay replied, &ldquo;Even now you&#146;re thinking that I&#146;m a stranger. But I&#146;m not a stranger. I&#146;m inside your mind.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..49"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=49 type=paragraph -->I looked at him, astonished.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..50"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=50 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Unfortunately for me,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;I won&#146;t find you alone tomorrow at breakfast time.&rdquo; Again he started saying: &ldquo;You just got up and took off your blanket.

<a name="3..51"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=51 type=paragraph -->We were quiet for a few minutes. Again he resumed speaking.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="3..54"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=54 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;A&#x301;klmand Singh also got in this compartment once,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He also knew me.

The chain couldn&#146;t handle the weight and as a result the train gave a strong jerk and came to a halt. The railway officers started searching and came into this compartment. &lsquo;Who pulled the chain,&rsquo; they asked. &lsquo;I didn&#146;t pull it,&rsquo; said A&#x301;klmand. &lsquo;Just look. There&#146;s a bag tied to the chain. It only weighs a maund.&rsquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..55"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=55 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;The rail authorities replied, &lsquo;You&#146;ll have to pay a fine. Why did you hang something that weighs a maund from there?&rsquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..56"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=56 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;&lsquo;Come on!&rsquo; said A&#x301;klmand. &lsquo;If my little one maund breakfast bag can stop the train, what can be worse than that! Rather, if you want, I&#146;ll get down from the train. I weigh five maunds. Then the train should be light enough to be able to move.&rsquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..57"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=57 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;I was thinking to tell this story if I saw you,&rdquo; said Madhumalay. Then he added. &ldquo;I know about another event. Once some students were keeping an old mole in a cage in a room in Britain&#146;s India House. No one could go near the cage due to the terrible smell and the continuous high-pitched squealing. On a whim they decided: &lsquo;Let us have a test to see who can stay the longest in that foul-smelling room. Whoever stays the longest will get the title of Knight.&rsquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..58"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=58 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;There was a queue to go into the room. Who doesn&#146;t want to be called a knight? But every candidate came out before a minute was up. No one could stay even a minute and a half.  Then A&#x301;klmand Singh said, &lsquo;I&#146;ll try.&rsquo; He went in and stayed in nearly a full five minutes. Then they heard the sound of the cage rattling. Everyone was astonished to see the old mole somehow pull the cage out of the room, though he was still in it.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..59"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=59 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Everyone asked, &lsquo;My word, mole! Why did you come out?&rsquo; He replied, &lsquo;Who can survive in that room? I was able to stay five minutes because of the virtue I&#146;ve acquired from seven lifetimes of penance. Now give me my knighthood as first prize. I&#146;m going back happily to my sugar cane field&rsquo;.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..60"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=60 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Not a bad story,&rdquo; I said.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..61"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=61 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Now you lie down for some time,&rdquo; said Madhumalay. &ldquo;I&#146;ll just be sitting here. Go to sleep and don&#146;t worry about anything.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..62"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=62 type=paragraph -->Again it was silent for a while. After some time I got up to go to the bathroom. Madhumalay looked at me and said, &ldquo;Now it&#146;s exactly 2:30. This isn&#146;t a good time to go to the bathroom.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..63"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=63 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;Why are you saying such a thing?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..64"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=64 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;If you wait a few minutes to go it&#146;ll be better.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..65"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=65 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Look,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I don&#146;t believe in any kind of superstition. Don&#146;t mind, but I&#146;m going to the bathroom.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..66"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=66 type=paragraph -->Looking a little sad, he said, &ldquo;OK, then go.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..67"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=67 type=paragraph -->I went into the bathroom and locked the door behind me. I stepped forward and almost stumbled over something in front of me. When I looked down I was amazed to see a freshly dead body. I looked at the face carefully and saw&#8230; what!&#8230; it was Madhumalay Mitra! But just a few seconds ago I had seen him sitting on the seat across from mine; he was perfectly healthy when he was speaking to me. How could he have gotten into the bathroom ahead of me? And how could he have died in such a short span of time?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..68"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=68 type=paragraph -->The corpse was wearing the same clothes that Madhumalay had been wearing when he was sitting in front of me. Even the lighter that I had put in his hand a little while before was in the right hand of the dead body. I thought, let me go back quickly and tell the Madhumalay that was sitting in front of me what&#146;s happened; I&#146;ll show him the lighter and see if it&#146;s the same one or not. As soon as I took the lighter out of the corpse&#146;s hand, the bathroom light went out. I left the bathroom cautiously, careful not to step on the dead body. When I arrived back at my seat what do I find? How strange! Where is Madhumalay? He&#146;s gone! But his hankerchief was still on the seat. It was as if he was saying,<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="3..71"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=71 type=paragraph -->I quickly returned to the bathroom but, amazingly, there was no dead body there. Cold air was whizzing through the slits in the bathroom window shutter, and there seemed to be a voice keeping time with the sound of the inrushing air: &ldquo;Now it&#146;s 2:30 in the morning&#8230; I have to go&#8230; whoever comes, comes so that they can go&#8230; whoever goes, goes so that they can come&#8230; I loved you&#8230; I loved you very much&#8230; I still love you and always will. Keep the hankerchief and the lighter. Under your bed you&#146;ll find a covered plate that I left there with some Dhaka parot&#x301;as [a fried, unleavened bread]&#8230; You must take them with your breakfast.

<a name="3..72"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=72 type=paragraph -->I returned to the compartment and picked up Madhumalay&#146;s hankerchief. The strong scent of attar was rising from it.

<a name="3..73"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=73 type=paragraph -->I turned off the overhead light. As the train left Jishidi and headed towards Jhahja, the cold was tearing the heart of the dark winter night with a plaintive lament.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="3..75"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=75 type=paragraph -->A few days later I went to Howrah station and found a railway employee to help me locate that same compartment from the train.

<a name="3..76"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=76 type=paragraph -->The railway employee told me: &ldquo;A few days ago a passenger by the name of Madhumalay Mitra met an unnatural death in that compartment and since then there have been a number of fantastic and puzzling complaints.

<a name="3..77"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=77 type=paragraph -->I was dumbfounded. It was difficult for me to understand because this happened in the waking state, not during the dream state or deep sleep.

By adding the suffix d&#x301;a to either verbal root, chii or cho, we get the word cha which means &ldquo;to pen through something&rdquo;, &ldquo;to scrawl&rdquo;. It should be remembered here that in ancient times, before the invention of script, the words rekha&#x301; [line] and lehka&#x301; [writing] carried the same meaning. After the invention of the alphabet, the meaning of lekha&#x301; became &ldquo;that line which expresses a letter&rdquo;. And rekha&#x301; became a basic word. Still, in accordance with the ra-layorabhedah rule (such as roma/loma, rohita/lohita, rakta/lakta, arakta/alakta) rekha&#x301; used to be used for lekha&#x301; and lekha&#x301; for rekha&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>

By adding the prefix pari to the verbal root at&#x301; its meaning becomes &ldquo;moving while looking and learning&rdquo; (pari + at&#x301;ana = paryat&#x301;ana); pari + at&#x301;aka = paryat&#x301;aka [traveller] or &ldquo;he who moves from one country to another while looking and learning&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>

That house which is continuously moving or growing we call at&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301;lika&#x301; [mansion]. At&#x301;t&#x301;a means &ldquo;that whose flow of movement is unhindered&rdquo;.

Though there is no fixed rule, generally &ldquo;continuity&rdquo; and &ldquo;continuous&rdquo; are used in the abstract sense and &ldquo;contiguity&rdquo; and &ldquo;contiguous&rdquo; in the physical sense. For example, we can say that Patanjali&#146;s philosophy is a kind of at&#x301;t&#x301;a or continuity of Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya philosophy whereas Thailand maintains territorial contiguity with Bengal.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="4..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->In some limited cases the verbal root anc means &ldquo;to move&rdquo;. Its usual meaning is &ldquo;to determine&rdquo;, or &ldquo;to demonstrate&rdquo; or &ldquo;to point out&rdquo;. We use our finger to point out some sight or a spot on a map and say &ldquo;that place&rdquo;. For this, the root anc is used. From the root anc and the suffix ka we get the word aun&#x32D;ka. Since the n here is apada&#x301;nta [not at the end of the word], then in this case the construction is made with the fifth varn&#x301;a, that is, it becomes aun&#x32D;ka rather than am&#x301;ka. The etymological meaning of aun&#x32D;ka is &ldquo;that which has been fixed&rdquo;, and the colloquial meaning is &ldquo;lap&rdquo;. The science which is based on fixed numbers, such as four, five, ten, twelve, is aun&#x32D;kasha&#x301;stra or mathematics &ndash; algebra, arithmetic, trigonometry, surveying, etc. are all part of mathematics. Aun&#x32D;ka is also used to mean &ldquo;part&rdquo;. That drama which has only one aun&#x32D;ka [act] is called eka&#x301;unkika&#x301; drama. The Bengali word a&#x301;nka has come from aun&#x32D;ka. (It also means &ldquo;arithmetic&rdquo;. In the rural language, a&#x301;nka kas&#x301;a&#x301; [to count] is still common.) By adding the suffix lyut&#x301; to anc we get the word aun&#x32D;kana which means &ldquo;drawing&rdquo;. Its spoken form is a&#x301;nka&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->By adding the suffix ka to the root anc we also get the word aun&#x32D;ga which means &ldquo;to determine&rdquo;. &ldquo;This is a hand, this is a foot&rdquo;. In this way whatever has been fixed we call aun&#x32D;ga [limb]. In the construction of aun&#x32D;ga, m&#x301; cannot be used; the fifth varna una must be used.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Anc suffixed by alac gives us the word ain&#x32D;cala which means &ldquo;a fixed place&rdquo;. In the construction of ain&#x32D;cala also, m&#x301; should not be used; rather it should be written with the fifth varn&#x301;a, ina, because here the fundamental root uses an apada&#x301;nta n.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="4..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->The meaning of the root anj is &ldquo;to grow&rdquo;, &ldquo;to increase&rdquo; or &ldquo;to extend&rdquo;. To welcome a guest we extend our hand or we extend a garland of flowers. Since, at the time of welcoming, something is extended, we use the word sam&#x301;varddhana&#x301; (from sam&#x301;varddhan, &ldquo;to increase&rdquo; or &ldquo;to extend&rdquo;) for &ldquo;welcoming&rdquo;. We also get the word aun&#x32D;ga when we add the suffix ac to anj; its meaning is &ldquo;that which has grown&rdquo;. All those parts which have grown from the main body, or any portion of that growth, is thus also called aun&#x32D;ga. For this reason hands, feet, eyes and ears are all classified as aun&#x32D;ga. In olden days, that country that was situated at the far border of northern India was considered an outgrowth of northern India and so its name was Angadesh [the country of aun&#x32D;ga]. It was between Barendrabhumi and Mithila which were on the north bank of the Ganges. South of the Ganges was Magadha and the land of Rarh, and within them was this Angadesh. Karna was probably a famous king of this Angadesh.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->If we add lyut&#x301; to anj we get the word aun&#x32D;gana which means &ldquo;the growth of a house&rdquo;, or courtyard (angane a&#x301;o ab java rasiya [come in my courtyard now, Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a] &ndash; Vidyapati). In ancient days, during the height of male-domination, women used to be confined to the courtyard. Other than women who worked as physical labourers, no one was allowed outside the courtyard. Thus the women of that time were called aun&#x32D;gana&#x301;.

<a name="4..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->By adding lyut&#x301; to anj we also get the word ain&#x32D;jana [sulphate of antimony used as collyrium] which means &ldquo;that which increases lustre&rdquo;. Needless to say, the fifth varn&#x301;a in&#x32D;a is used; am&#x301; is not used.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="4..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->The word ad&#x301;d&#x301;a is old Bengali. Many believe that the word is perhaps of foreign origin. The actual meaning of the word is &ldquo;many coming together in a single place&rdquo;. Later, the word ad&#x301;d&#x301;a&#x301; became transformed into a&#x301;d&#x301;d&#x301;a&#x301;. The word a&#x301;d&#x301;d&#x301;a&#x301; [dwelling place, rendezvous] is still used in Bengali today.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="4..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->The meaning of the verbal root n&#x301;u is &ldquo;to deliver&rdquo;. The formal meaning of pran&#x301;ava (pra &ndash; n&#x301;u + al) is &ldquo;that which has been delivered excellently&rdquo;, in other words, that which has been successfully delivered to Parama Purus&#x301;a. The colloquial meaning of pran&#x301;ava is on&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra [the sound of on&#x32D;m]. According to certain scriptures, by fixing one&#146;s concentration on the pran&#x301;ava sound one will arrive at the original source, the Purus&#x301;ottama [Cosmic nucleus]. In the Shruti it is said:<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="4..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->The Tripa&#x301;davibhu&#x301;ti Narayan&#x301;a Shruti has clearly said:  Pran&#x301;ava&#x301;tmakam&#x301; Brahma. The vibrational flow of the Cosmic Self oscillates the universe through innumerable expressions. Each individual expression is known as deva and the original source from which they emanate, that Supreme source, is known as Maha&#x301;deva. That is, this pran&#x301;ava, being emitted from the nucleus of the universe, flows in waves through the different levels of matter and mind and continues on to limitlessness. It is not destroyed. It only knows how to move ahead. All kinds of inferential manifestation, all kinds of expressions originating in the nerve fibres, vibrate in that series of waves. Even when those waves pass into the far distance where the sky can place no obstacle in their path, even in that abstract world, they are expressed in the flow of inferences. Whatever sound is emitted continues eternally, whether or not we are able to perceive it. Whatever form vibrations have come into existence will continue endlessly, whether or not our optic nerve is able to catch them. This flow of waves is the on&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra. On the one side it is the Macrocosm and on the other, innumerable microcosms, molecules dancing around the Macrocosm.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->What does not do what the root n&#x301;u does is an&#x301;u [molecule]. From n&#x301;u plus the suffix d&#x301;rn&#x301; we get the word n&#x301;u. Here the a is a negation. An&#x301;u means &ldquo;that which does not deliver anyone anywhere&rdquo;. It has come by itself. The microcosm dances around the Macrocosm, but the Macrocosm does not dance around the microcosm. Hence the an&#x301;u does not deliver anyone; it arrives by itself.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->When the an&#x301;u goes from distant to close, when it goes from a partially manifest vibration and arrives at the original base of that vibration with the help of the series of waves through vibrational simulation, it arrives at its supreme station. Thus the Macrocosm is great and the microcosm small. The smallest portion of any entity that carries its fundamental characteristics is known as an&#x301;u. Still, colloquially, any small entity can be, or is, called an&#x301;u. The living being is an an&#x301;u of Parama Purus&#x301;a. Molecular existence is all an&#x301;u, though there are individual differences at the molecular level. The smaller portion of the an&#x301;u, which does not carry its fundamental characteristics, is known as parama&#x301;n&#x301;u [atom].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->An&#x301;u must be written with n&#x301;. If it is written with n it becomes a prefix. The meaning of the prefix anu is &ldquo;back&rdquo; or &ldquo;behind&rdquo;. If anyone arrives (gamana) somewhere after another person arrives, then we say that he has &ldquo;followed&rdquo; (anugamana). If someone moves (saran&#x301;a) somewhere, that is, if he walks or moves aside, and meanwhile someone else moves behind him we say that they have &ldquo;followed&rdquo; (anusaran&#x301;a). If someone does something or has done something or has been doing something, and someone else also does that something after him, we call that &ldquo;imitating&rdquo; (anukaran&#x301;a). To indicate the desire to do this we add ap after the suffix san which gives the word anucikiirs&#x301;a [the desire to imitate].<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="4..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->Tal + ac = tala. By adding the negation a before tala we get atala. The natural or etymological meaning of the word atala is &ldquo;that whose bottom is too deep to be found&rdquo; &ndash; in spoken Bengali we say Ya&#x301;r thai pa&#x301;cchi na&#x301;. The colloquial meaning of atala is &ldquo;the third level down in the successive order of crudeness&rdquo;. Just as when we ascend we have bhu&#x301;-bhuvah-svah-maha-jana-tapa-satya with satya loka being the subtlest, when we descend we find tala right below bhu&#x301;loka, below that atala, and then similarly tala&#x301;tala, pa&#x301;ta&#x301;la, atipa&#x301;ta&#x301;la, and rasa&#x301;tala. Rasa&#x301;tala is considered the crudest. Of course, the word rasa&#x301;tala is used to mean the worst kind of hell.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="4..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->The word ati has various meanings. Sometimes it implies &ldquo;abundance&rdquo;, sometimes it signifies &ldquo;excess&rdquo;, sometimes &ldquo;that part of growth which is unnecessary&rdquo;. The word iisha means &ldquo;lord&rdquo;, &ldquo;controller&rdquo;, &ldquo;director&rdquo;, &ldquo;ruler&rdquo;; the formal meaning of atiisha is &ldquo;formidable ruler&rdquo; or Maha&#x301;kaola. Its colloquial meaning is &ldquo;fit to be welcomed by all&rdquo; &ndash; wise sage.

<a name="4..30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->The meaning of the verbal root ad is &ldquo;to eat&rdquo;. Atta&#x301; means &ldquo;eater&rdquo;. In the Vedas it is said: Atta&#x301; vishvasya satpatih. We get the word anna from the root ad. Ad + na = anna. If hasanta da [where the a after the d is omitted] is followed by na, then na is inserted in place of d. The etymological meaning of anna is &ldquo;that which is eaten&rdquo; or &ldquo;that which can be eaten&rdquo;. The colloquial meaning of anna is &ldquo;the chief food of any area&rdquo; &ndash; in some places rice, in others bread, or potato or porridge. Just as a Bengalee is correct to call rice anna, so would an Irishman be correct to call potato anna. A&#x301;luka &rarr; a&#x301;lua &rarr; a&#x301;lu [potato]. What we call a&#x301;lu came to India from abroad about 400, 450 years ago. Thus it has no separate name in Sanskrit. A&#x301;luka used to be used for sweet potato. (Shakarakanda: Sharkara&#x301;kanda &rarr; shakkarakanda &rarr; shakarakanda) In some parts of India this sweet potato or shakarakanda is anna for the poor people. Although it is tasty, it has little nutritive value.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..31"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->Apa<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->Apa is a prefix. It denotes opposition. That which goes against karma [deed] is apakarma [misdeed]. When we say devata&#x301; we mean &ldquo;one who has many kinds of good qualities&rdquo;. One who does not have good qualities is called apadevata&#x301;. Imaginary ghosts are thus called apadevata&#x301;. The antonym of utkrs&#x301;t&#x301;a [excellent] is apakrs&#x301;t&#x301;a [inferior]. The antonym of sain&#x32D;caya [accumulation] (sam &ndash; ci + al = sain&#x32D;caya) is apacaya [squandering] (apa &ndash; ci + al = apacaya). Caya is created by adding the suffix al to the root ci. But if ghain&#x32D; is the suffix, then in place of the letter ca, ka is inserted, that is, ci + ghain&#x32D; = ka&#x301;ya, not ca&#x301;ya (the spelling ka&#x301;ya&#x301; is incorrect). Apakrti can be used as the antonym of sam&#x301;skrti [culture] but apa-sam&#x301;skrti cannot because sam&#x301;skrti means &ldquo;that which has ascended to an advanced level of krti [deed]&rdquo;. Apa means a degraded condition. How can the two then go together? Can a stone bowl be made of gold? Furthermore, apakrti also means &ldquo;misdeed&rdquo;. Thus asam&#x301;skrti, rather, should be used as the antonym of sam&#x301;skrti.<!-- /block --></p>

The etymological meaning of apa&#x301;na is &ldquo;that which does not help in increasing fluidity&rdquo;. According to the yogic scriptures, apa&#x301;na is one of the five internal va&#x301;yus [vital forces]. There are ten different internal and external va&#x301;yus. The internal va&#x301;yus are pra&#x301;n&#x301;a, apa&#x301;na, sama&#x301;na, uda&#x301;na, and vya&#x301;na.<!-- /block --></p>

Ku&#x301;rma va&#x301;yu helps with the action of contraction. The way a turtle contracts by withdrawing its limbs into its body is called ku&#x301;rmabha&#x301;va. Since this va&#x301;yu helps in effecting ku&#x301;rmabha&#x301;va, it is called ku&#x301;rma va&#x301;yu. One should keep in mind that ku&#x301;rmabha&#x301;va and ku&#x301;rmana&#x301;d&#x301;ii are not the same thing. Ku&#x301;rmana&#x301;d&#x301;ii is a point in the throat at the bottom-most portion of the periphery of Vishuddha cakra. If mental equipoise is brought about in the ku&#x301;rmana&#x301;d&#x301;ii then the body&#146;s vibrations can be temporarily stopped. (According to yogis, bulls have the capacity to fix their mind in the ku&#x301;rmana&#x301;d&#x301;ii, thereby achieving a state where they can go without moving for a long time. To see them, it would appear as if they were not a living being but a statue chiselled out of stone.)<!-- /block --></p>

It expresses itself in the increase or decrease of air pressure. Krkara va&#x301;yu helps in yawning and stretching. Ordinarily, yawning happens right before falling asleep, and stretching, right after waking up. In the spoken languages of north India, yawning is called jemna&#x301; and stretching is called a&#x301;m&#x301;d&#x301;e lena&#x301; &ndash; in Bengali we say a&#x301;d&#x301;mor&#x301;a&#x301; bha&#x301;un&#x32D;ga&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>

In this unnatural condition it strikes against the sama&#x301;na va&#x301;yu causing the sama&#x301;na va&#x301;yu to lose its equilibrium. As a result, the navelly-situated sama&#x301;na va&#x301;yu and the upper body pra&#x301;n&#x301;a va&#x301;yu quit their respective areas and merge; the two then create pressure on apa&#x301;na va&#x301;yu.

This condition we call &ldquo;navel breathing&rdquo;. As a result of the uda&#x301;na va&#x301;yu losing its normal functioning, a rattling sound is produced in the throat.

These five vital forces, having become one, leave the body and join the aerial factor or merge in Maha&#x301;pra&#x301;n&#x301;a [Cosmic Life].

The process by which we try to bring the vital forces under control is called pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;ya&#x301;ma in the yogic scriptures. Pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;n yamayatyes&#x301;a pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;ya&#x301;mah.

Its meaning also ends up being essentially the same, that is, the special effort whereby the normal flow of inhalation and respiration is altered and a temporary cessation of respiration is introduced by special means, is called pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;ya&#x301;ma.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..50"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=50 type=paragraph -->It sometimes happens that due to sudden accident or the attack of a deadly disease, the body is so disturbed that its vital force becomes paralysed. This can happen with cholera (visu&#x301;cika&#x301; in Sanskrit), pox (ma&#x301;riigut&#x301;ika&#x301; in Sanskrit), snakebite, death by poisoning, and death by hanging.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..51"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=51 type=paragraph -->Suddenly, there is an accidental death, but the body is not broken into pieces. Since the vital energy is paralysed, there is no opportunity for navel breathing or only very little. When the vital energy has been paralysed, it seems apparently as if death has occurred while actually it has not &ndash; that comes a little later. During this condition, if the respiration can be reestablished by an artificial process, the vital energy wakes up and becomes active or can do so.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..52"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=52 type=paragraph -->As long as the vital energy is paralysed, there will be no sign of decay in the body. In olden days, whenever a person&#146;s vital energy became paralysed for one of these reasons, the people, rather than cremating or interring the so-called dead body, used to attach it to a raft and float it in water. In the open environment or atmosphere of the river, the vital energy, in some cases, used to become fully active again. Thus, in those days, especially in cases of cholera, pox or snakebite, the people used to float the dead patient in water out of a spirit of welfare. In such cases, where the vital energy is paralysed, there is absolutely no chance of it returning if the body is cremated. If the body is interred underground it becomes even more grievous because that vital energy may reawaken for some time in the grave. After a short struggle the person falls again into eternal sleep in the darkness of the tomb. Thus, after these types of death it is better not to burn or bury the deceased until they have been examined by a competent physician.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..53"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=53 type=paragraph -->I remember a story now about paralysed vital energy that I have not thought about for many years. I was going from Biharshariif to Ranchi via Gaya.

It was late in the evening when I arrived in Gaya, about a quarter past eight. After finishing my work, I decided that if I spent the night in Gaya I would be late when I got to Ranchi the next morning. Instead, why not go on ahead as far as I could? I could stay at some resthouse along the way. Then I could start at dawn the next morning and arrive early in Ranchi.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..54"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=54 type=paragraph -->So that is what I did.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..55"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=55 type=paragraph -->Around 10:00 at night I reached the Gobhi dak-bungalow. After a few shouts, the caretaker woke up. I told him I wanted to spend the night there and leave at dawn. He seemed like a good man but he replied, &ldquo;Look, Sahib, no one stays in this resthouse at night. As you can see, the jungle is not far from here. There are ferocious animals in the jungle, bears and some tigers also. After a little while you&#146;ll hear the tigers roar. Four or five years ago the bathroom was broken; no one uses it. The authorities don&#146;t want to repair it either so it&#146;s really not possible for you to sleep in the room tonight. As you can see, we still haven&#146;t gotten electricity in our rest house. We have the old-fashioned pull-fan<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.4.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#4.fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> but we haven&#146;t had a fan-puller for two years.

<a name="4..56"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=56 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Now it&#146;s cold season,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;What&#146;s the harm if there is no fan-puller?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..57"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=57 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;What can I say, sir,&rdquo; replied the caretaker. &ldquo;Until now, I haven&#146;t seen anyone who has been able to remain in any of the rooms of this house.

<a name="4..58"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=58 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;I&#146;ll sleep outside in the garden,&rdquo; I said.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..59"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=59 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Like I told you,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;There&#146;s the danger of bears and tigers.

<a name="4..60"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=60 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;I&#146;ll sleep under a mosquito net,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Bears and tigers won&#146;t come through the net. You don&#146;t have to worry.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..61"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=61 type=paragraph -->The man reluctantly agreed. He arranged a cot, some bedding and a mosquito net for me. When I laid down for the night I saw something white a little distance from the bungalow in the soft light of the waxing moon. I asked the caretaker if he knew what it was.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..62"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=62 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Sir, I don&#146;t see very well at night,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I&#146;ll tell you in the morning.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..63"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=63 type=paragraph -->I had some fruits with me, so I ate something and lay down. The caretaker started heading home.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..64"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=64 type=paragraph -->At that time British rule had just ended. The pressure of British domination was felt everywhere. But in this Gobhi area there was virtually no sign of the civilized world. It was completely jungle, and in the middle of it this little dak-bungalow. There were no houses, no market, no din and bustle nearby. If you shouted there would be very little hope that anyone would hear you. The caretaker said he would come at five in the morning. Until then I would be completely alone.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..65"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=65 type=paragraph -->Anyhow, feeling tired, I laid my torch next to my pillow and went to bed. After a few minutes my eyelids grew heavy and I dropped off to sleep. Some time later I was roused by a rustling sound. What do I see? At the foot of the bed two hands were lifting up the mosquito net and coming in, human hands. There was no need of the torch because there was enough moonlight to see by.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..66"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=66 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Who&#8230; who&#8230; who,&rdquo; I said. Slowly the mosquito net rose up and the upper portion of a human body entered along with the two hands.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..67"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=67 type=paragraph -->Was it a man? The image of a man created by the play of light and shadow? The glorious treasure of a human being vibrant with life? But why was it so silent? I could feel the touch of the cold air coming in from the forest at the foot of my bed. Was this heaven or hell? Or some other place, beyond either one?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..68"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=68 type=paragraph -->The fellow stood there like a statue chiselled out of monolithic rock. I became very annoyed and turned over on my other side. From the forest I could hear the constant drone of crickets, ghostly owl cries, and the occasional sound of a va&#x301;rshim&#x301;ha deer. One sound in particular, I assumed, was the call of a deer. I could also hear the strange cries of hyenas. I had heard that there were bears, pythons, wild boars and a few man-eating tigers in this forest, but I didn&#146;t hear any. Hunters say that the calls of deers and tigers never come from the same part of the jungle at the same time because deer won&#146;t go anywhere near an area where a tiger is roaring, so if you hear the call of a deer you can be sure that there are no tigers nearby.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..69"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=69 type=paragraph -->I tried to sleep a little. But who can sleep through misfortune? At the foot of the bed cold air was still coming in from the forest so I knew that the figure was still standing there lifting up the mosquito net. I got more and more annoyed. I decided to ignore him for a little while, but if he still didn&#146;t go away I would scold him mercilessly and compel him to leave.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..70"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=70 type=paragraph -->Two or three minutes passed. He continued to stand there, holding up the mosquito net and staring at me. Then I rebuked him severely in the local Magahii language: &ldquo;What are you doing here? Whom do you want? If you&#146;ve got no business here, well I have! I&#146;m trying to sleep.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..71"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=71 type=paragraph -->He started to tremble and I could see that he was embarrassed. Then he started speaking in a very sweet, soft voice: &ldquo;I came to make sure that you could sleep properly.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..72"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=72 type=paragraph -->He had answered me in Bengali. Seeing his gentlemanly behaviour, my mind softened. Looking closely, I could see that my visitor was a young man about twenty-two or twenty-three years old, wearing winter clothes.

<a name="4..73"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=73 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;Where do you live?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..74"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=74 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;My name is Niila&#x301;in&#x32D;jana Bhain&#x32D;ja. My home is in Hazaribag. But it seems I am bound here by my strong attachment to the place.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..75"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=75 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;I saw how late you arrived and I knew the night would be troublesome for you. The caretaker of this place is a very good man. He was right to try to get you to stay in the next dak-bungalow at Caopa&#x301;ran&#x301; instead of staying here. That&#146;s a very good dak-bungalow. Everything he said was quite correct. It&#146;s his duty to stay here at night, but he doesn&#146;t do so out of fear. He leaves at 10:00 every night and comes back around five in the morning. His village is about a mile from here. Whenever he goes and whenever he comes he gets eerie feelings and becomes afraid. It&#146;s like that. If I had to come then I&#146;d also feel the same way.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..76"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=76 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;I saw that you had bananas and guavas for dinner. Imagine how I felt. You wanted to take a bath but the water from the well here is not fit for use. Even though the caretaker left a bucket of water before he left, thinking you might need it, still you didn&#146;t use it to bathe. Imagine how we felt. Finally you went to bed on a cot in the garden and fell asleep. I didn&#146;t get any chance to speak with you. Then I thought, let me lift up the mosquito net and tickle the bottom of your feet a little. If you woke up, then I would ask you if you wanted to come to my house.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

It&#146;ll get even colder as the night goes on. All you have is an endi [rough silk] shawl to cover yourself. You&#146;ll be very uncomfortable. Secondly, the wild animals from the forest make noise all night long and they&#146;ll keep waking you up. You see how much trouble it is? So we want to make the best of a bad situation and give you the best room in the bungalow. We&#146;ve cleaned the room and arranged everything. You won&#146;t have any problems there.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..79"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=79 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;The keys are underneath my pillow,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Where did you get the keys from?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..80"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=80 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;I have a duplicate set of keys,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;We often go back and forth to the bungalow at night.

Va&#x301;savii has been doing long-term research on Magdha&#146;s gods and goddesses during the Maha&#x301;ya&#x301;na Buddhist era. Once she visited with you the rocky land that is in front of Sha&#x301;masuddin Miyan&#146;s house in Pa&#x301;ha&#x301;d&#x301;iya&#x301; village. In that rocky land there were different figures of gods and goddesses from Magadha&#146;s Buddhist era, some broken or half-broken, and others still intact. Va&#x301;savii said that you helped her in many ways. So I can&#146;t let you remain in such a troublesome situation. Please heed what I am saying and come to the room.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="4..84"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=84 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;I&#146;ve done a little research on the river civilizations of Rarh and Jharkhanda. But you can hardly find a single book on the subject so I haven&#146;t been able to go very far in my research.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="4..90"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=90 type=paragraph -->Niila&#x301;in&#x32D;jana started for the room and I followed after him. By the way, there is one thing I should mention about our walk over. My shoes were squeaking as I walked but Niila&#x301;in&#x32D;jana&#146;s were absolutely silent. It was as if his feet weren&#146;t touching the ground at all, or if they were, they were touching it so lightly that no sound was coming. It was quite strange. Like being in a spectral world. There was some moonlight so there were very few fireflies. Those few that were there moved aside when they saw me, but when they saw Niila&#x301;in&#x32D;jana they did not move at all, as if they did not acknowledge his existence. Such a thing! As if he was a phantom moving in a phantom world, lost in a magical inner realm.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..91"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=91 type=paragraph -->I arrived at a large room. Niila&#x301;in&#x32D;jana really did have a duplicate set of keys. Otherwise how could they have opened the room? I could see from the decaying condition of the earth and brick walls that the house had been built either at the beginning of the British era or at the end of the Mughal era. It was along this road that they used to send the mail from Bengal to Delhi with mounted postal bearers. At points along the way there were arrangements for food and lodging for the riders and their horses.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..92"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=92 type=paragraph -->As I entered the room I was keenly aware of the strangeness of the situation. There was no light on in the caretaker&#146;s room but here they had lit a wall-lamp. Although one could more or less make things out in its dim light, one couldn&#146;t see very well. From the open door that white apparition from the forest could still be seen indistinctly, the same white apparition that the caretaker had told me he couldn&#146;t see clearly at night and would inform me about in the morning.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..93"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=93 type=paragraph -->The bed was laid out. I lay down and covered myself with my en&#x301;di shawl. The room was fairly warm. Niila&#x301;in&#x32D;jana pulled up a stool and began fanning me.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="4..101"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=101 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;This was during the time before the breath of man had warmed the earth&#146;s air. All the way south, in the area near Meghasini peak, the mountains ran more or less southeast. The rest of the mountains ran from west to east and their last lofty peak was Sametashikhar, that today is known by the name of Pareshna&#x301;th. To the east of this Pareshna&#x301;th was the ancient land of Rarh and to the west was Jharkhanda. Of course this was before human beings came to the earth.<!-- /block --></p>

When human beings came and made the ancient soil of Rarh holy with the touch of their feet, they built their dwellings on the banks of these rivers. Not only humans &ndash; those prehistoric creatures who came hundreds of thousands of years before the advent of men also used to live on the banks of these rivers because all living beings need water.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..103"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=103 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Do you know why I&#146;m only talking about Rarh and not about any other part of Gondwanaland? Elsewhere it was extremely cold and full of snowstorms. There was no proper environment there for human beings to evolve. Rarh had the living touch of warmth so humans came there first. They founded the world&#146;s most ancient civilization and culture, which we can call the original Rarh culture.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..104"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=104 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Nothing stops in this world, neither animate nor inanimate. It is not only that these rivers carried vital force for existence. They also led the irresistible attainment of civilization and culture swiftly toward union with the sea. That civilization that is founded upstream in the river reaches its fullness downstream. No two rivers carry identical civilizations. Thus, after two rivers merge, their combined flow carries yet a third civilization.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..105"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=105 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Take, for instance, a small example. In our Birbhum there are two very small rivers: the Kopa&#x301;i and the Vakreshvara. The flow of these two civilizations and cultures is nearly the same. The spoken language of the people who live on their banks is also almost the same. But notice, I say &lsquo;almost&rsquo; rather than &lsquo;the same&rsquo; because they are not identical. Afterwards, when they join each other in Mela&#x301;npur near Inda&#x301;sa village (the famous Indraha&#x301;sa from the Jain era) and become the Kuye river, then its accompanying civilization and culture becomes a little altered. The people who live on the banks of the Kuye river enjoy the blessings of both the Kopa&#x301;i and Vakreshvara rivers.<!-- /block --></p>

Their customs, behaviour, mode of living, and spoken language are the same but the Mandar hill, which is very near Dumka&#x301;, is situated on the Chandan river and thus the customs, comportment and language there is different than Dumka&#x301;&#146;s. Kandi is quite far from Dumka&#x301; but they are alike in all ways. Moreover, Ka&#x301;ndi is very close to Jangipur but Jangipur&#146;s culture is different; its spoken language is Shershahabad Bengali. You will find this kind of history with all rivers. The rivers of Rarh did not simply carry sand and alluvium to the sea, thereby making the Bengali plains, they also brought the verdant riches of civilization and culture to Bengal.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..107"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=107 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;After the rise of the Himalayas from the ocean, the Ganges and the Brahmaputra rivers brought the flow of civilization and culture with the current of their waters. The Ganges brought the Indo-Aryan culture, but near Sahebganj, where the Ganges turns south, the Gaorhiya [a portion of Bengal] influence over the cultural life increased. Similarly, as the Brahmaputra reached the Assam valley near Sadiya there was a mixture of the Tibetan and Burmese civilizations. The triple mixture of these two with the Indo-Aryan gave rise to the Kamarupa civilization which a little downriver became transformed into the Bengali culture.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="4..113"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=113 type=paragraph -->I looked and saw Niila&#x301;in&#x32D;jana&#146;s pen glittering on the table.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..114"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=114 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;I also left my wristwatch beside it,&rdquo; said Mainjula&#x301;. What&#146;s the use of a wristwatch in this pitch darkness. Indeed, our life is pitch dark in this forested area, isn&#146;t it? Better these things be free from the darkness of Hades and enjoy the light and air of the free world in your museum.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..115"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=115 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;I hope you&#146;re not feeling any inconvenience. If you do, you must let me know. A little while ago I changed the bedsheet. The mattress is very stiff. It wasn&#146;t possible to change it so late at night. All this time I&#146;ve been busy trying to think of what might help you fall asleep quicker. You didn&#146;t really have a chance to eat, but it wasn&#146;t the right time to bring you food. After my duty is finished, I&#146;ll make you some breakfast and leave it in the car. You certainly have to eat on your way to Caopa&#x301;ran&#x301;.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..116"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=116 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Of course, I have a strong attraction to the terrain of Gondwanaland,&rdquo; continued Mainjula&#x301;. &ldquo;But I feel more attraction for the different plants and wild animals of this area, in a word, the flora and fauna. In the laterite soil of this land you find mostly piya&#x301;l (piya&#x301;sha&#x301;l), pala&#x301;sh, kus&#x301;um, sha&#x301;l, and kendu trees. You also come across wild jackfruit, wild mango and custard-apple trees. Was the tree-life and different birds and beasts of this area the same during the end of the Pleiocene or beginning of the Meoiscene ages when ape-men first appeared?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..117"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=117 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Well keep in mind,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;that the custard-apple trees you find here in the wild were brought by the Portuguese about 450 years ago. What do you know about pala&#x301;sh?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..118"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=118 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Well, looking at the colour of the flower and its qualities, it seems to me that rather than the three varieties we have nowadays, white, red and yellow, there was only the red variety. The tree was ten times taller than the pala&#x301;sh trees of today. The flowers were bright red but very big in size, and the fruits were quite small but sweet and juicy.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..119"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=119 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Your thinking is correct,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;because there are more pala&#x301;sh trees in the eastern portion of Gondwanaland. Where rivers have more or less level land on both sides you get this red soil that the pala&#x301;sh tree favours. The interesting thing is that in all the river basins of that area, especially the Damodar, Ajaya, Ushri, Konar, Barakar, and the Mahanadii&#146;s central river basin, you get ample amounts of coal &ndash; high quality coal. The primary source of material for this coal is decomposed pala&#x301;sh trees. Those pala&#x301;sh trees were not like the pala&#x301;sh trees of today but they were the forefathers of today&#146;s pala&#x301;sh trees.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..120"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=120 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;The part of Gondwanaland in which we are now is more or less divided into east and west by the Koyel river. The difference between east and west is not only evidenced in the terrain, but also in the flora and fauna. I would guess that the western mountains that we now call the Vindhya and Sa&#x301;tpura&#x301; mountains were once much higher. They had peaks higher than the Himalayas. Flora and fauna could not evolve there in the ancient past due to excessive snowfall, but the eastern mountains, although very high and snow-capped, were not as high as the western mountains. It is likely that the first appearance in the world of both flora and fauna was here, in this area where we find our ancient Rarh and Jharkhanda. In the west, the melted ice ran into the Arabian Sea. Although there was water, the soil was unfertile, so there was little flora and naturally little fauna as well. But in the east, where the water from the melted snows became rivers, the cold was not so severe. So the first expression of developed life was in the land of Rarh &ndash; this we can be certain of.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..121"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=121 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Thus we find an abundance of prehistoric fossils in the eastern portion of the Ramgarh Hills, the Dalma&#x301; Hills, the Megha&#x301;sinii belt, and the southeast portion of the Rajmahal Hills (Pa&#x301;kud&#x301;a and Rajmahal sub-divisions). The small hills of Bankura District, especially the Shushuniya&#x301; Hills, are also an extension of this Ramgarh range. Fossils of various types of ancient animals have been found near these hills. Still, the greatest amount of fossils are lying in the areas closest to the Suvarn&#x301;arehka&#x301;, Kam&#x301;sa&#x301;vatii, and Damodara rivers. It is quite clear that the brontosaurus and other dinosaurs lived in this region. Rhinoceroses also used to roam the extremely high grasses of this area. Just two hundred years ago rhinoceroses were living in Birbhum and Kandi sub-division. Only 125 years ago rhinoceroses were spotted in Rajmahal and Pa&#x301;kurh.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..122"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=122 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;There were also huge birds of the phinge variety with loose, hanging tails. I would guess that the size of a single bird was about five or six feet. Their tales used to trail on the ground and the sabre-toothed tigers of that day used to catch them easily by stepping on their tails with their paws. But when the sabre-toothed tiger disappeared from Rarh about 700,000 years ago, these large-bodied birds also became extinct. The descendants of these huge birds, the phinge and doyel birds of today, are much smaller in size. The hyena (gova&#x301;gha&#x301;, hud&#x301;a&#x301;l, hud&#x301;a&#x301;r, or hun&#x301;da&#x301;r in rural Bengali; in Madhya Pradesh vighava&#x301;) of today is the descendant of this sabre-toothed tiger.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..123"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=123 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Ape-men or man-apes first took birth in this part of the earth. There were some differences between the humans that evolved on either side of the Koyel river in terms of intelligence and other qualities. Such differences still exist today among their descendants. On the eastern side was the dwelling place of the Munda clan<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.4.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#4.fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> of that primitive age, and on the western side lived the Ora&#x301;no clan. The former belongs to the Austric group &ndash; their language also. Many Austric-family words are still used in modern Bengali, such as kurhi [twenty], dula&#x301;l (from dula&#x301;r [darling child]) and gha&#x301;d&#x301;a [neck], among others.<!-- /block --></p>

Later they were subdued by others and forced to take shelter in the forest at the far edge of the Rajmahal Hills.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..126"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=126 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;In those ancient days there was a great deal of fighting between the ape-men and man-apes. The apes did not know the use of fire so they could not use it to burn their enemies. When men learned the use of fire, they started to burn to death their main enemies, the apes, and eat them. During the British era also, the Biirhorhs used to burn apes to death and eat them. They also had some attraction to cannibalism, however, there is no proof that they ever ate human beings. One can deduce from this that they used to kill the apes for the purpose of eating their enemies.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="4..130"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=130 type=paragraph -->I continued. &ldquo;Near the high mountains of this Gondwanaland there were many huge pits. With the passage of time the mountains eroded and became large hills, then smaller hills, knolls and mounds. Today also, Rarh and Jharkhanda are full of these hills, hillocks and knolls. Thus the land is undulating. What is today the lowest portion of this undulating land was at one time deep pits. And the upper portions were very tall mountains. Although many large pits have filled up, not all of them have. In Rarhii Bengali they are called ka&#x301;ndar (from kandara in Sanskrit). Still there are a few very large pits.

As we were approaching Gobhi our car had to swerve to avoid getting hit by a truck and it fell in a huge gorge. Oh! If I think about it, even today, I lose consciousness. The last thing I heard was Niila&#x301;in&#x32D;jana crying &lsquo;Didi&rsquo;. I can still hear him. He was driving the car. We all fell in the gorge and were severely hurt but no one died.

At one time, the river had a very sharp (ks&#x301;uradha&#x301;ra&#x301;vat), strong current. Thus in Sanskrit its name became ks&#x301;urika&#x301;. Later that became ks&#x301;uri in Bengali.

Anashana means &ldquo;not to eat&rdquo; in the sense of not being able to eat. A&#x301;ha&#x301;ra also means &ldquo;to eat&rdquo; but a&#x301;ha&#x301;ra means &ldquo;to eat something that has been carefully selected&rdquo;. Thus ana&#x301;ha&#x301;ra means &ldquo;not eating carefully selected items&rdquo; &ndash; filling the stomach with worthless edibles. Hence ana&#x301;ha&#x301;ra and anashana are not identical. The meaning of upava&#x301;sa is completely opposite. Upa means &ldquo;near&rdquo;. Upava&#x301;sa means &ldquo;to stay in close proximity&rdquo;. Most of the year people are busy with matter. If one fixes a specific day to suspend one&#146;s worldly activities and remain near God or live near God then it is called upava&#x301;sa. When all other worldly activities have been suspended, then on that day one should also refrain from eating. Therefore eating is discontinued on that day. Thus these three words, anashana, ana&#x301;ha&#x301;ra and upava&#x301;sa are quite different from each other.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="4..213"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=213 type=paragraph -->The first and chief meaning of aks&#x301;a is &ldquo;to mark off&rdquo; or &ldquo;to draw a line&rdquo;. The line which is marked off in the middle of the earth is the equator (vis&#x301;uvarekha&#x301;); its ancient name is maha&#x301;vis&#x301;uva&#x301;ks&#x301;a. If we mark off another line parallel to the equator, then that line is also called aks&#x301;a or aks&#x301;a&#x301;m&#x301;sha [latitude]. The difference between the seasons is determined according to the dispersion of the visible and non-visible rays based on the proximity or distance of the sun relative to the equator or the lines of latitude.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..214"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=214 type=paragraph -->The meaning of the word aks&#x301;i is &ldquo;eye&rdquo;. Aks&#x301;a is also used to mean &ldquo;to have eyes&rdquo;. For example, one who has eyes like a lotus (kamala) is called kamala&#x301;ks&#x301;a; one who has eyes like a dove (kapota) is called kapota&#x301;ks&#x301;a; one who has eyes like the early morning blue sky is called navaniila&#x301;ks&#x301;a. When the word aks&#x301;a is used in feminine gender it becomes aks&#x301;ii. For example, one who has eyes like a peacock (mayu&#x301;ra) is mayu&#x301;ra&#x301;ks&#x301;a in masculine gender and mayu&#x301;ra&#x301;ks&#x301;ii in feminine gender.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..215"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=215 type=paragraph -->Another meaning of the word aks&#x301;a is alphabet &ndash; fifty letters (aks&#x301;ara) whose first letter is a and last letter is ks&#x301;a. One should keep in mind that the aks&#x301;ama&#x301;la&#x301; [alphabet] means the fifty letters from a to ks&#x301;a &ndash; the extra letters (qua, qhua, za) are not included within it.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..216"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=216 type=paragraph -->The word rudra&#x301;ks&#x301;a can be derived in two ways. Those eyes in which there is raodrabha&#x301;va (rudrata&#x301;) [fierceness] are rudra&#x301;ks&#x301;a. Rudraks&#x301;a can also be derived to mean &ldquo;where the dispersive power of the alphabet is full of rudrata&#x301;&rdquo;. Its colloquial meaning is a special type of wildflower which grows in south and southeast Asia and is used to make garlands.<!-- /block --></p>

<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="4.fn1"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.4.fn1">1</a></b>)  It has now come to mean &ldquo;beautiful woman&rdquo; or simply &ldquo;woman&rdquo;. &ndash; Trans.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="4.fn2"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.4.fn2">2</a></b>)  Some people use the word sa&#x301;ma&#x301;nya when they mean alpa [a little, some]. It is better not to do this. Sa&#x301;ma&#x301;nya does not mean &ldquo;a little&rdquo;. It means &ldquo;common&rdquo; or &ldquo;general&rdquo;. For example, if we say that Bengali is the sa&#x301;ma&#x301;nya language of this country we mean that is the language of the common people. This word comes from sama&#x301;na [equal]. By what logic, then, can it mean &ldquo;a little&rdquo;?</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="4.fn3"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.4.fn3">3</a></b>)  Until the beginning of British rule, there used to be a pull-fan system in the houses of zamindars and foreigners and the person employed to pull the rope used to be called the pa&#x301;m&#x301;kha&#x301;barda&#x301;r. This pa&#x301;m&#x301;kha&#x301;barda&#x301;r used to sit in the little room at the end of the veranda, next to the bedroom in dak-bungalows, and pull the rope; inside the room the aristocrats would enjoy the breeze from the fan. If there was ever any slackness in the motion of the fan you could know that the pa&#x301;m&#x301;kha&#x301;barda&#x301;r was dozing off. A little scolding and the fan used to start again.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="4.fn4"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.4.fn4">4</a></b>)  Sim&#x301; Mun&#x301;d&#x301;a&#x301;, Kha&#x301;nga&#x301;r Mun&#x301;d&#x301;a&#x301;, Ho-Mun&#x301;d&#x301;a&#x301;, Kherhiya&#x301; Mun&#x301;d&#x301;a&#x301; (shavar), Va&#x301;orii, etc. The Sim&#x301;mun&#x301;d&#x301;a&#x301;s and Va&#x301;oriis use Bengali for both formal and ordinary occasions, while the rest, although their common language is of the Austric group, use Bengali for formal occasions in some places and in others Sa&#x301;da&#x301;nii. <br> Another name for the Na&#x301;gpurii language is Sa&#x301;da&#x301;nii or Sadarii. This language belongs to the Occidental Demi-Magadhii family. The other languages of this Occidental Demi-Magadhii group are Magahii, Bhojpurii and Chatrishgarhii. The Oriental Demi-Magadhii-derived languages are Maethilii, Angika&#x301;, Bengali, Assamese, and Oriya. These are the nine chief languages derived from Ma&#x301;gadhii Pra&#x301;krta that are spoken today.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="4.fn5"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.4.fn5">5</a></b>)  Kuruka and the Muriya&#x301; and Ma&#x301;riya&#x301; languages in the southwestern portion of the Ora&#x301;no area of Gondwanaland, are part of the Dravidian group, although they still show significant Austric influence. There is, moreover, a clear influence of Bengali in their very close neighbour, the Ha&#x301;lavi language. In these languages the Dravidian influence is also quite clear, but by comparison, the Austric influence is much greater.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="4.fn6"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.4.fn6">6</a></b>)   Biir means &ldquo;forest&rdquo;. Hor&#x301; means &ldquo;man&rdquo;. Biirhor&#x301; means &ldquo;forest-man&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="4.fn7"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.4.fn7">7</a></b>)  Many people mistakenly say ra&#x301;jagrha. This is incorrect. If the word had been ra&#x301;jagrha then in modern Magahii its name would have become ra&#x301;jaghara. Rather the word is ra&#x301;jagiri or &ldquo;royal mountain&rdquo;. Ra&#x301;jagira was not only the ancient capital of Magadha, it was its cultural centre as well, the crown jewel of Magadha civilization. For that reason I have said many times that the spoken language of Ra&#x301;jagira should be accepted as standard Magahii.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="4.fn8"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.4.fn8">8</a></b>)   The river flows just past Nawada station.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="4.fn9"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.4.fn9">9</a></b>)  Near Sametashikhara is the combined border of Rarh, Magadha, and Jharkhanda. Of course, in the &ldquo;Jha&#x301;d&#x301;akhan&#x301;d&#x301;e Vaedyana&#x301;thah&rdquo; Shloka a slightly different opinion is expressed but there is no historical evidence to support that opinion; both Grdhraku&#x301;t&#x301;a Mountain and Cakravartii Mountain are historically in Magadha.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="4.fn10"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.4.fn10">10</a></b>)  In those days a lamp was hung on the wall which was used both in the cities and in the villages during British rule. They used to spill less oil than the hurricane lanterns but they were inconvenient to move from one place to another. Some people used to call them deya&#x301;lgiis.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="4.fn11"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.4.fn11">11</a></b>)  During British rule the house-servants used to address the daughters of the house as mishiba&#x301;ba&#x301;. Most probably the word was created by joining the word &ldquo;miss&rdquo; to the respectful word ba&#x301;ba&#x301;.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="4.fn12"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.4.fn12">12</a></b>)  In the Magahii language, the banyan tree is called bar&#x301;ke rukh. At one time yaks&#x301;a [a mythological race of demons] worship used to be performed at the foot of the banyan tree. The people used to have both devotion and fear for that place. Even today people do not go there alone after dark. That place is called &ldquo;the abode of Brahma&rdquo;.</p>

<a name="5..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->According to linguistic science a + a = a&#x301;. Hence it is considered a double vowel. But despite being a double vowel its pronunciation is only slightly more difficult than that of the single letter a. In the opinion of some scholars, there was an amphibious creature by the name of aproposthiumas who, after spending some time moving about on wet, warm land, would afterwards dive back into the cool water, lift its head above the water and make the sound a&#x301;, a&#x301;, a&#x301; [ah, ah, ah] as an expression of its sense of relaxation. This was, perhaps, the first sound made by a living creature, the first a&#x301; sound. Even today we say &ldquo;uh&rdquo;, &ldquo;oh&rdquo;, or &ldquo;eeh&rdquo; to express some hardship, but when we relax we make the sound a&#x301;. In Roman script we add a diacritical mark above the letter a to denote the sound a&#x301; or else we write a second a next to it. In the Semitic languages we add a mark next to the head of the letter &ldquo;aliph&rdquo; to denote a&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="5..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->By adding the suffix ka to the verbal root anc we get the word aun&#x32D;ka. The root anc means &ldquo;to point something out by using one&#146;s finger&rdquo;. In certain limited cases the root anc is also used for movement. By using the ka varga instead of the ca varga we get anka from the verbal root anc. Specifically, in the etymological sense we use kola (in Sanskrit both kola and krod&#x301;a can be used) and in the colloquial sense we use the word aun&#x32D;ka.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->In the sense of being the expression of a fixed part or a fixed idea, we use the word aun&#x32D;ka [act] to denote any one of the main portions of a drama. Any drama which is composed based on one fixed idea is called eka&#x301;nkika&#x301; [one-act play].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Numerology has no borders, no limits. It is bottomless, unfathomable, endless. However, whenever we limit it to a certain idea then we call it am&#x301;ka [number]. Thus one, two, five, seven are aun&#x32D;ka. The science [sha&#x301;stra] which consists of the negotiation of these numbers is called aun&#x32D;kasha&#x301;stra [mathematics]. Arithmetic, algebra, geometry, trigonometry, numeration tables, astronomy, and surveying are all branches of mathematics. To fix something by the use of lines is known as aun&#x32D;kana or a&#x301;nkana [drawing], and their derivative a&#x301;nka&#x301; is also used. The Bengali form of the word aun&#x32D;ka, which is a&#x301;nka, is also used both in the sense of &ldquo;number&rdquo; and &ldquo;mathematics&rdquo;. In our younger days we used to say a&#x301;nka kas&#x301;a&#x301; in rural Bengali for aun&#x32D;ka kara&#x301; or aun&#x32D;ka kasa&#x301; [to do sums, to count].<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="5..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->In the Vedic language the meaning of the verbal root iks&#x301; (the root iiks&#x301; is also used) is &ldquo;to see well&rdquo;, &ldquo;to observe&rdquo;, &ldquo;to find out in detail&rdquo;, &ldquo;to study&rdquo;. Iks&#x301;u (iks&#x301; + un) means &ldquo;that which is studied in detail&rdquo; or &ldquo;that which is seen with earnest attention&rdquo;. This is its etymological meaning. Its colloquial meaning is sugar cane [a&#x301;kha]. Iks&#x301;u &rarr; ikhu &rarr; ikh/a&#x301;kh. In Bengali a&#x301;kh is used. In standard Hindi it is ikh. In Urdu-Farsi it is called ganna&#x301;. In Bhojpuri ukh, in Magahii, Angika&#x301; and Na&#x301;gpuri keta&#x301;rii or keta&#x301;r&#x301;ii, in Maethilii kushiya&#x301;r. In Bengali also, the words kushiya&#x301;r, kusher, kushur, and kushul are used. The word kushiya&#x301;r has come from the Laokik Sanskrit word kusheruka&#x301; or kushakera&#x301;: kushakera&#x301; &rarr; kushaera&#x301; &rarr; kushia&#x301;r &rarr; kusher &rarr; kushur/kushul. The word kushiya&#x301;r was widely prevalent in Old Bengali. Since it is smaller, the word a&#x301;kh is more popular nowadays. As regards this meaning of the word a&#x301;kha, in Old Bengali people used to say a&#x301;kuya&#x301;, in modern Bengali ekho (ekho gur&#x301; [sugar-cane raw sugar]). Many villages and the chief rivers of some river valleys of those areas that were once renowned for the cultivation of sugar cane are known as kushiya&#x301;ra&#x301;. (Many know about the kushiya&#x301;r&#x301;a river in Shriihat&#x301;t&#x301;a District and the kushiya&#x301;ra&#x301; subdivision in Burdwan District. The Rarhii Brahman appellation kusha&#x301;ri comes from the name of this Burdwan subdivision.)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Among the grass family of plants (monocotyledonous), bamboo is the tallest and the durba&#x301; and dudhiya&#x301; varieties of grass are the shortest. Sugar cane lies in the middle. Since, in the grass family, different varieties grow according to differences in region and climate, sugar cane also differs according to time and place. Sugar cane prefers a wet, warm climate. The wetness and warmth help sugar cane achieve greater length and thickness. The best soils for sugar cane are loamy soil and sandy, clayey soil. Sugar cane is a one-year-crop &ndash; in India from the months of Ka&#x301;rttik to Ka&#x301;rttik, or Ma&#x301;gh to Ma&#x301;gh.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Sugar cane does not grow in cold climates. Even if planted, it will die when there is a frost. Thus, even with great efforts, it is not possible to cultivate sugar cane in predominately cold countries. Hot countries supply sugar cane sugar to the cold countries. During the time of the First World War, the supply of sugar from the hot countries (Fiji, Mauritius, India, Southeast Asia) was disturbed and so a lot of effort went into the cultivation of sugarbeets in Europe and into increasing the sugar content of ordinary beets, which brought about the development of today&#146;s sugarbeet. Since then the cold countries are no longer dependent on the hot countries for their sugar supply. However, though sugar is gotten from sugarbeets, molasses is not. The production of molasses still depends on sugar cane. Besides this, the leftover fibres from sugar cane can be used for the manufacture of paper and certain chemical substances, while sugarbeet fibres cannot serve as a base for any such commercial use. From the qualitative standpoint also, that is, from the standpoint of food value, sugar cane is superior to sugar beet.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->One can venture a guess that when people became familiar with molasses [gur&#x301;] during the Vedic era (gur&#x301; is a very ancient, pure Vedic Sanskrit word &ndash; madhvabha&#x301;ve gur&#x301;am&#x301; dadya&#x301;t), they were also familiar with sugar cane. It may be, however, that during the time that the Vedic Aryans lived in Central Asia, they were familiar with molasses but not with sugar cane, that is, they imported the sugar-cane molasses from hot countries. Still, it would not be wrong to guess that they had heard the word iks&#x301;u. Thus, considering people&#146;s attraction to sugar cane, even from a distance, they named the plant iks&#x301;u.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->In the past, in certain parts of the world, sugar-cane seeds were produced through artificial means but the cultivation of sugar cane from these seeds was not successful. Sugar cane is grown from the eyes on the knots of the cane. These eyes should be planted at least one yojana, that is to say, twelve miles, from their old place of origin. It is in no way desirable that the eyes be planted in the same land they come from because then they will be much more liable to be attacked by insects. This rule is also applicable to banana and radish. Because sugar cane ties up the land for a full year, its cultivation is becoming less popular nowadays.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Sugarbeets mature in three months. The drawback with sugarbeets is that they do not produce seeds in hot weather. Their seeds have to be brought from abroad, from cold countries. When sugar cane is still young, wheat, jute, barley and autumn rice can be grown alongside it according to the season, and spinach can also be planted. But once the sugar cane has become big, nothing else can be grown with it except for plants of the cha&#x301;ya&#x301;ja&#x301;ta [shadeborn or shadegrowing] tuber group such as ginger, tumeric, sweet potato, yam, and a&#x301;ma a&#x301;da&#x301; [esculent root having smell of green mango]. There needs to be proper scientific research done so that sugar cane be harvested in less time.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->If bees are fed off sugar-cane juice they can create a very high quality honey. Because there are not sufficient flowers throughout the year there is sometimes a lack of floral nectar. Thus, during this time very little honey collects in the hive. This problem can be easily solved by feeding domesticated bees sugar-cane juice.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="5..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->This word has come from the Sanskrit word agni (aj + ni). The etymological meaning of agni is &ldquo;that which grows quickly&rdquo;, or &ldquo;that which eats or devours quickly&rdquo;. The colloquial meaning of agni is a&#x301;guna [fire].

<a name="5..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->The first step forward in human civilization was the discovery of fire. The second step forward was the discovery of iron. The third step forward was the invention of the wheel. That human clan of the prehistoric era which first discovered fire was considered the most civilized and advanced clan of its time. Gradually the use of fire became prevalent in all human communities. Thereafter, that community which first learned the use of iron leapt over the boundary of the stone age, bone age and bronze age, and was considered to have the most advanced civilization. The use of iron brought a new unfolding to the movement of human history, a new radiance. At that time the wheel had not yet been invented, and thus there were no vehicles. Later, with the help of iron, human beings produced the wheel. They learned to wage war seated in vehicles mounted on wheels. By sharpening the edge of the wheel they invented a weapon called the discus. The boomerang is also a type of discus used by the Maoris of Australia. In India and Central Asia people learned the use of the wheel in very ancient times, but no matter how long ago they learned it, they learned it after they learned the use of iron. That is, first they invented the chariot wheel, then afterwards turned the wheel into a weapon.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->At one time, the ancient Mayan civilization of America was more advanced than many other civilizations, but because they lagged behind in the invention of the wheel, they were forced in subsequent times to acknowledge their defeat at the hands of other civilizations. The oldest existing artifacts of the Mayan civilization give evidence to advanced ways of life but no wheel. One should keep in mind that the Sanskrit name for America, Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;dviipa, came from the name of the Mayan civilization. During the Chola, Pa&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ya, and Pahlava dynasties of the Indian Middle Ages there was contact between America and India &ndash; this was before Columbus&#146;s discovery of America.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->For the use of iron and the wheel, fire is necessary. Thus, in ancient times, after discovering fire, people began to show it respect and worship it as a god. The Aryan gods of that ancient era were Indra, Agni, Varuna, etc. The Vedic scholars used to preserve fire in certain houses through the means of a special sacrificial pyre. They were known as Sa&#x301;gnika or Agnihotrii [priests charged with maintaining the sacred fire]. That sacrificial fire, which they would feed with offerings of sacred wood and special mantras, would be put into the mouth at the time of death; this became known as mukha&#x301;gnikriya&#x301;, although today it no longer has much signficance. Nowadays no one preserves the sacred fire in their home. Today fire is kept in a matchbox or in a lighter.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->In subsequent times, when the discovery of fire became old, the importance of the god Agni diminished. The different Vedic gods, Indra, Agni, Varuna, gradually disappeared. In the next era, the gods Brahma&#x301;, Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u and Maheshvara filled the void they had left. When the god Agni was still flourishing in the imaginary world of the people, they also gave him a wife and gave her the name Agna&#x301;yii (agni in feminine gender is agna&#x301;yii). In Hindi the word a&#x301;ga is feminine gender. Since there is no neuter gender in Hindi, nothing can be said if someone uses a&#x301;ga in feminine gender, but if agni is used in the feminine form then it is certainly an error. If agni is feminine gender then what gender will agna&#x301;yii be? Thus, even if I use a&#x301;ga in Hindi in feminine form, I use agni in masculine form. In feminine gender I use agna&#x301;yii.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="5..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Formerly in Bengal, as well as in eastern India, Agraha&#x301;yan&#x301;a was the first month of the year. Generally, in the lunar calendar, the lunar month is named after whatever constellation the end of the full moon night is in. For example, when the end of the full moon night is in the constellation Visha&#x301;kha&#x301; then the concerning lunar month is called Vaesha&#x301;kha; if the end of the full moon night is in Jyes&#x301;t&#x301;ha&#x301; then the concerning month is called Jyaes&#x301;t&#x301;ha; if the constellation is Bhadra&#x301; then the concerning month is called Bha&#x301;dra, and so forth. The sole exception to this is the month of Agraha&#x301;yan&#x301;a. Its full moon night finishes in the constellation mrgashira&#x301;. According to practice, the name of the lunar month should be ma&#x301;rgashirs&#x301;a or ma&#x301;rgashirya, but in Bengal the name ma&#x301;rgashirs&#x301;a or ma&#x301;rgashirya is not in vogue. The word agraha&#x301;yan&#x301;a is used meaning the first month of the year. Agraha&#x301;yan&#x301;a &rarr; aggaha&#x301;yan&#x301;a &rarr; aggha&#x301;na &rarr; a&#x301;ghana. Subsequently, it seems that, unlike the custom in the rest of India, Bengal did not accept the month of Caetra as the beginning of the year. The lexicographer, Amar Singh, accepted Caetra as the first month but there is no evidence that this was accepted in Bengal.

<a name="5..38"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=38 type=paragraph -->The meaning of the word aun&#x32D;ga&#x301;ra in Sanskrit is kayla&#x301; [coal]. The modern word kayla&#x301; has come from the word koilo which evolved from Ma&#x301;lavii Pra&#x301;krta. (The Guja&#x301;rati, Saora&#x301;s&#x301;trii, Kacchii, Ma&#x301;rava&#x301;r&#x301;ii, Meva&#x301;rii, Har&#x301;aotii, and Ma&#x301;lavii languages have come from Ma&#x301;lavii Pra&#x301;krta. The Kacchii language evolved from a mixture of Ma&#x301;lavii Pra&#x301;krta and Saendhavii Pra&#x301;krta. In this language there is the influence of both Guja&#x301;rati and Sindhii). The people of India and of Bengal have been long acquainted with mineral coal. The local people are well acquainted with open-pit or open-quarry coal but it was only during the time of the British administration that extracting coal from the earth by digging quarries was introduced. Since aun&#x32D;ga&#x301;ra or a&#x301;un&#x32D;ga&#x301;ra means both charcoal and mineral coal, one is called ka&#x301;t&#x301;hkayla&#x301; [charcoal] and the other pa&#x301;thure kayla&#x301;, in order to differentiate between the two.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..39"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=39 type=paragraph -->It is quite true that decomposed trees from hundreds of thousands of years ago became transformed into coal but not all trees are turned into coal. If there is insufficient thermal pressure within the earth&#146;s crust then dead trees will decay and become dirt. If there is the requisite pressure then ordinary coal will take the form of the highest quality coal or different forms of carbon such as graphite or diamond. As a result of an accelerated increase or decrease in atmospheric, environmental, or thermal conditions, trees (living or dead) which do not take on another form in the decomposed state, are turned into fossils. The river valleys of Rarh and Gondwanaland are among the best depositories of coal in the world. Because the Damodara river basin contains huge coal reserves, there have been fires since ancient times in the open pits along both of its banks. The local people are quite familiar with these events. Due to the abundance of coal many villages in Western Rarh are named A&#x301;un&#x32D;ga&#x301;rd&#x301;ihi, A&#x301;un&#x32D;ga&#x301;rd&#x301;iha&#x301;, A&#x301;un&#x32D;ga&#x301;rsuli, Hiira&#x301;pur, and so forth. Because there is a lot of combustible coal in the Damodara river basin, the river is called Da&#x301;modara (da&#x301;ma + udara = da&#x301;modara; that is, &ldquo;that which has da&#x301;ma in its belly&rdquo;. In laokik Sanskrit, the meaning of the word da&#x301;ma is &ldquo;fire&rdquo;).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..40"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=40 type=paragraph -->In ancient India a&#x301;un&#x32D;gara&#x301; used to be called ha&#x301;r&#x301; a&#x301;un&#x32D;gra&#x301; or &ldquo;bone charcoal&rdquo;. Because this bone charcoal was used to make sugar odourless and colourless, many widows in those days would not use it. While performing their worship also, they would use native sugar in place of this coal sugar.<!-- /block --></p>

The word calana is used in a general sense. Caran&#x301;a means &ldquo;where there is eating going on there is also movement&rdquo;; that is, that which is created by a certain person&#146;s way of eating, behaviour, and all other expressions in the external world is called a&#x301;caran&#x301;a. In English, the closest corresponding word is &ldquo;conduct&rdquo; but the word &ldquo;conduct&rdquo; is not completely synonymous with the word a&#x301;caran&#x301;a. In English, the word &ldquo;character&rdquo; can also be used to mean a&#x301;caran&#x301;a but the word &ldquo;character&rdquo; is closer to the Bengali word a&#x301;ca&#x301;ra. Thus, for the rules of a&#x301;caran&#x301;a, the expression &ldquo;conduct rules&rdquo; is nicely suited. Still a&#x301;caran&#x301;a does not comprise all of life. A&#x301;caran&#x301;a is the collective name of expression of a certain part of life.<!-- /block --></p>

A&#x301;ca&#x301;ra is the composite of eating, living, behaviour and all external expressions and their concerning mentalities. Thus we can say that a&#x301;ca&#x301;ra is the reflection of life in its totality. Just as one cannot comment on the conduct of a person if they do not know them very well, one is even less able to comment on their character. Although one may be able to say something about one aspect of a person, that is, about their conduct, one takes a greater risk if they want to say something about their character. By caritra is meant that part of a&#x301;caran&#x301;a which is externally well-manifest. If one has some rough knowledge then one can certainly make some comment about one&#146;s caritra provided one accepts the liability, but if one does not accept the liability or risk then there is nothing one can say. Dramatists, novelists and litterateurs portray the character of their own mentally-created entities. Thus they have the right to comment in this matter. But one will have to make sure that these entities are really their mental creations. It is not at all desirable to suddenly say or write something if one does not know something about the creations of the real world.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..45"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=45 type=paragraph -->Talking about a&#x301;caran&#x301;a and a&#x301;ca&#x301;ra brings to mind an old memory. At that time I used to go for a walk nearly every day in the mountains east of Jamalpur. I used to sit on the second mountain. One after another, several small and large mountains run parallel to each other. The summit of the second mountain was the highest place among them. I used to arrive there in the middle of the afternoon and stay there until about eight at night. Then I would climb through the ga&#x301;b (a large variety of kendu) forest that lay in the valley between two mountains. In this valley there was also a small lake. First I would cross the mountain, passing by the right side of the lake, and then I would take a shortcut back home. One day I was sitting on the peak. It was the bright lunar fortnight and I knew the path through the forest well so there was no need of a torch. Behind me, that is, to the east, there was a high plateau that was completely covered with woods. Most of the trees were sa&#x301;l, piya&#x301;l (piya&#x301;sa&#x301;l), and pala&#x301;sh. In front of me, that is, to the west, on the slope of the mountain, was a dense ga&#x301;b forest. After that, in the valley in front, was an old tamarind tree. Other than this, there was very little vegetation. The mountain in front was completely bare.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..46"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=46 type=paragraph -->It was the lunar fortnight, beautiful moonlight. I was probably the only person for several miles, completely alone. To my right was a dried-up spring. The spring would have water for three or four months during the rainy season when the water would rush down quickly from above into the valley below. From that mass of water the lake was formed and the overflow from the lake would flow through many small streams into the little Dakra river which emptied into the Ganges west of Monghyr, below the Monghyr-Patna road.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..47"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=47 type=paragraph -->Behind me, the jungle-covered plateau, though not plentiful with wildlife, still had some tigers, bears, hyenas, and the shambar and ba&#x301;rsinga&#x301; varieties of deer. That evening, however, I had not heard any sounds from them. Most likely they would not begin making sounds until after 10:00 or so at night. Beside the peak that I was seated on was a path that led down the mountain; they would take this path down to the lake to drink.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..48"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=48 type=paragraph -->That day there was a strong, sweet breeze coming from the forest behind me and blowing out towards the mountain in front. I started feeling a little drowsy, having worked more than normal that day.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..49"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=49 type=paragraph -->I started nodding off but after a time I heard what sounded like someone approaching me from behind. I turned around to look and saw a fair-skinned person wearing western clothes. I was somewhat surprised, for three reasons. First of all, it was extremely unlikely that anyone would be in that area after the sun went down. Secondly, though there was a lot of forest, even thieves would not dare come to cut wood for fear of wild animals. Thirdly, in those days western clothes were completely out of place there.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..50"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=50 type=paragraph -->Though this was the time of British rule, everyone knew that Westerners never came anywhere near such places. I asked him in English: &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; Looking at him, I could see that he was a real gentleman but he approached me without replying. He started looking around in all directions until his eyes came to rest on the valley in front of us. This time I asked him in Angika who he was and what he was doing there so late at night in such a deserted place. In those days such places were not completely safe. Then he answered me in a very soft and sweet, but unnatural, Bengali. &ldquo;As long as you are here I&#146;m not at all afraid.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..51"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=51 type=paragraph -->I was speechless. At any rate, his face bore the stamp of a gentle, courteous soul. As best as I could see in the moonlight he looked to be about twenty-three or twenty-four years old and from a good family. I invited him to sit down on the rock next to me. He thanked me politely and sat down. As he sat, I felt a change in the environment around me, as if someone had fashioned a dream world out of the power of ma&#x301;ya&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..52"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=52 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;I am very near and dear to you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You know me but perhaps nowadays you&#146;ve forgotten me.&rdquo; I gazed at him and noticed his unblinking eyes.

His body did not seem to be of this earth. Somehow it seemed to be made of light and shadow&#8230; as if I was watching a talking picture.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..53"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=53 type=paragraph -->Seating my guest near me, I asked him in Angika: &ldquo;Are you one of our Angadesh boys?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="5..58"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=58 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;If you&#146;ll give me a few moments of your time,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;there are a few things I&#146;d like to say. If I start bothering you, please let me know and I&#146;ll stop.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..59"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=59 type=paragraph -->Then my visitor continued speaking. &ldquo;This happened a long time ago, at the end of the Mughal Period when the kingdom was in disarray. At that time the capital of the Province of Bengal (Bengal, Bihar and Orissa) was Murshidabad, and there was a zamindar in Singur (Hoogly district &ndash; at that time Burdwan district) by the name of Virendravijay Va&#x301;sumallik. Although he was a small zamindar he was a man of strong and independent thought. While the other zamindars were indulging in addictions and luxuries, he was not. He was directing all sorts of efforts to preserve the freedom of Bengali culture, civilization, and way of life.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..60"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=60 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;He was quite dissatisfied with the character and comportment of weaker-minded men like Nawab Alivardii Kha&#x301;n.

While it is true that he was a man of good qualities, and his character, as such, was unstained, still, in matters of character and comportment he was prone to weakness at every step &ndash; something which his wife, Lady Sharf-Un-Nisa&#x301;, was unable to check or hold together despite much effort. He used to hide many things from his wife.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..61"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=61 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;At that time the Marathas of the Bhonsale family used to attack quite often. Those attacks, which were under the leadership of Bha&#x301;skar Pan&#x301;d&#x301;it, were extremely bloody. The nawab was unable to make any provisions to resist them. This conduct of his was completely unpardonable. Rather, in order to avoid war, he was somehow able to strike a truce with the Marathas by giving them one fourth of the collected state revenue. When the Marathas arrived in Katoya, throwing Rarh into complete disorder, Alivardii Khan became aware of the danger but the nawab was not able to mount any resistance from Por&#x301;aha&#x301;t (Seraikela&#x301;-Kharsoa&#x301;n) to any part of Katoya. This weak conduct of the nawab continued to afflict the mind of the Bengali people.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..62"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=62 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Many of those who were wealthy took shelter in Calcutta and in Angadesh out of fear of the attacks of the Marathas. While the Marathas were skilled in land battle they were not known for their naval skill. Thus, to save Calcutta from Maratha attack, a ditch was dug to the northeast of Calcutta &ndash; today it is known by the name &lsquo;Maratha ditch&rsquo;. Seeing that he was being routed by the Marathas, the nawab committed yet another blunder. He took four large districts, Burdwan (what is today Burdwan, Hoogli, Howrah, and Jamtara), Midnapur, Chittagong, and the 24 Paragana, formed from the the eastern portion of Nadia-Chakla, and delivered them into the hands of the East India Company with the condition that the East India Company would help the nawab turn back the Marathas.

Shobha&#x301; Singh was as brave in character as he was firm. Most of the people of Bengal wanted him to be king of all of Bengal. The British also secretly wanted this and thus supported him from behind the scenes. Shobha&#x301; Singh saw that the British had come to his country to do business and realized that if they were afforded convenient business opportunities their friendship could be won, but two people were thorns in Shobha Singh&#146;s path.

This mental attitude kept them quite removed from the common people.<!-- /block --></p>

Because Siraj&#146;s character was not very expanded there is no scope for people to forget his worldly defects. It is true that most people accept that he was broad-hearted and generous, but this was not enough for him to gain a seat in the heart of the Bengali people. And he was the nawab for how long!<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..71"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=71 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Most of the people who supported the nawab were senior Hindu officers. The East India Company put forth their best efforts to try to please the Hindus so that they would withdraw their support from Siraj.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..72"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=72 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Virendravijay died shortly after the battle of Plassey. At the time of his death he told his only son, Vireshvijay, that he should dedicate himself wholeheartedly to the task of strengthening Bengal&#146;s culture, unity and economic situation, and asked him to use both his intellect and his courage rightly in this matter. At the time Vireshvijay was a boy of eighteen or nineteen. Vireshvijay carried out the instructions of his father and became well-versed in the martial treatises.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..73"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=73 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Neither Virendravijay nor Vireshvijay could support Mirzafar. Mirzafar was an indisciplined, power-hungry, spineless drunkard. His main preoccupation was to keep his nawabship intact by whatever means possible. For some time after his death the throne of Bengal was thrown into confusion. Thereafter Miirkashim became the nawab. His conduct was spirited, his behaviour showed individuality, and he was a man of strong character. Vireshvijay came into contact with him and Miirkashim befriended him, touched by his sincerity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..74"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=74 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;In those days the throne was the nawab&#146;s in name only. The power was in the hands of the East India Company; the administration was in the hands of the nawab but the economic power was not. Moreover, if one was to repel the East India Company, it would not be possible to accumulate power by sitting in Murshidabad because Murshidabad was right next to the East India Company&#146;s chief outpost. Vireshvijay advised Miirkashim to shift his capital from Murshidabad to Monghyr. He did not advise him to remove his capital to Azimabad (Patna) because Azimabad was, to some extent, a centre for the East India Company.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..75"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=75 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;There were one or two other reasons for making Monghyr the capital of Bengal. During the time of the Mahabharata, when Angadesh was first accepted as an independent kingdom, Duryodhana made Karna the king of Angadesh and rather than consider him a vassal, he allowed him to wear the crown of a sovereign king. Since ancient times the Anga region was not considered part of northern India. Neither Anga, Vanga, nor Kalinga were considered part of northern India. Starting from this time, Anga was declared an appendix or aun&#x32D;ga of northern India and hence its name became Angadesh. Vanga remained outside of northern India. Kalinga gained acceptance as a part of southern India. Thus, even today, Oriya Brahmins are sometimes known as Daks&#x301;in&#x301;a&#x301;tya Vedic Brahmins in Bengal. At the time of Karna the capital of Angadesh was Champakanagar.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.5.fn10"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#5.fn10">10</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> Karna also founded an auxiliary capital in Mudgagiri, on the western border of the kingdom of Anga. Hence Monghyr has a tradition as a capital.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.5.fn11"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#5.fn11">11</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> <!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..76"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=76 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;When Gujarat&#146;s Rastrakuts [a royal dynasty] defeated eastern India then Angadesh came under their jurisdiction. The Khirkhiriya Hills that we are sitting on were the eastern boundary of the Rastrakut kingdom. Thus they established a capital in their border city of Mungagiri. So we see that Monghyr became a capital more than once. At that time the road system of Bengal, as well as India, was not at all developed. The long highway Shershah built that extended from Suvarnagram in Dhaka District to the city of A&#x301;t&#x301;ak in western Punjab via Teota (Man&#x301;ikganj subdivision) and Howrah-Burdwan, and passing by Calcutta, did not afford much convenience to Murshidabad, Monghyr or Patna but Monghyr&#146;s water-route transport system was good. The waterway worked well all the way from Dhaka to Benares/Allahabad passing via Narayanganj, Teota, Rampur, Boyaliya (Rajsahii), Lalagola Ghat, Godagarii Ghat, Chapaghati, Rajmahal (At one time Rajmahal was the capital of Bengal), Bhagalpur, Monghyr, and Azimabad. Benares and Allahabad used to be helped out by the Shershah-built Badshahii road. Thus, since Monghyr was marked as an important centre of water transport, the capital could be established there without there being any communication problems as such.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..77"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=77 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Miirkashim accepted Vireshvijay&#146;s reasoning and moved the capital to Monghyr. On Vireshvijay&#146;s advice, the nawab set out preparing the capital in Monghyr with great speed and began constructing his armoury. A great fortress was built in Monghyr as well as a munitions factory, heavy-weapons arsenal, huge parade grounds (Karheya Maidan or Kora Maidan), and a new cultural centre, Kasimbazar. The East India Company recognized the danger. Seizing on various small pretexts they declared war against Miirkashim. They had economic power and were prepared for war &ndash; the nawab had nothing. He had just begun organizing. On the other side, the East India Company had concentrated their power at Fort William in Calcutta and in Alinagar (present-day Alipur, now a part of Calcutta).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..78"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=78 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;The first battle was a trifling affair; it took place in Katoya and the nawab was defeated. The second battle took place in Gheriya and there also the nawab was defeated. The third took place in Udhuya or in the Udhuyanala. The East India Company advanced along the Ganges in the direction of Monghyr. A great battle took place in the Dakra canal. With his finger my visitor pointed out to me the Dakra canal which originated on the western border of the Khirkhiriya Hills and joined the Ganges a little to the west of Monghyr. In reality, the Dakra was not a canal but a river. In the East India Company records it is mistakenly called a canal. At the time of the monsoon deluge, the water of the Ganges goes upstream through the Dakra River and floods a wide area in Monghyr District. At the time my visitor pointed out the Dakra canal there was heavy flooding.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..79"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=79 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;When the nawab was defeated in the battle of Dakra canal he started heading by water for Azimabad. The map and plans of the next battle site remained in the hands of Vireshvijay. The planning of how the next battle in Buxar and on the banks of the nearby Karmanasha river could be fought was not in the hands of the nawab. All he knew was that there would be a battle fought in those places. Vireshvijay got separated during the fighting and fell back a little south. He was not able to reach the banks of the Ganges and go upriver to Azimabad. But the warplans and maps were in his hands so he took shelter in the jungle of the Khirkhiriya Hills.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..80"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=80 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Another of the nawab&#146;s chief difficulties was his severe lack of economic resources. Vireshvijay knew that King Karna&#146;s huge treasury was secretly preserved in a cave in the Khirkhiriya Hills. He set about searching for that treasure thinking that if it came into his hands he would much better be able to help the nawab.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..81"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=81 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;At this point I should say something about the history of Angadesh&#146;s terrain. In Karna&#146;s time the north of Angadesh bordered on the Himalayas.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.5.fn12"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#5.fn12">12</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> The southern border was the source of the Chandan river, a little to the north of Deoghar. On the western border was Ramdiri and Shamhodira (Samidha), near Beguserai, and the eastern border was the Rajmahal Hills near Sahebganj where they approach the Ganges. The Rajmahal Hills range occupy a large area in eastern Angadesh. Their eastern branch stops abruptly near Sahebganj and the Ganges; its western branch ends near Monghyr by the side of the Ganges. The western branch&#146;s Sanskrit name is the Ks&#x301;iraks&#x301;irika Hills. In Angika they are called Khirkhiriya Hills and in English the Kharagpur Hills. These Kharagpur Hills are a branch of the Rajmahal Hills.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..82"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=82 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Southern Anga&#146;s chief river is the Chandan which has two companions, the Baruya and the Chiir. In this Chandan-Baruya-Chiir river basin<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.5.fn13"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#5.fn13">13</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  one finds the Kalhan Hills (near Kahalgaon, named after Maharsi Kalhan), Ajagavii Hills (near Sulatanganj), Mandar Hills<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.5.fn14"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#5.fn14">14</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  (a little north of the railway station), and these Khirkhiriya Hills on the western border where one can find, scattered here and there, innumerable examples of the culture of ancient Angadesh. Like the Angika culture, the language also belongs to this place.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..83"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=83 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Those who think that the Khirkhiriya Hills are the western border of Angadesh, however, are mistaken. To the west of the Khirkhiriya Hills lies the Dakra river basin. This Dakra river basin is Anga&#146;s final western border. Beyond the Dakra river basin lies the Kiul river basin where one can find many examples of Magadha culture, that is, it belongs to the land of Magadha.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..84"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=84 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;The Angika language has three chief dialects: Dharamapuriya, Champanagarii or Chekachekii, and Mangeriya. The Dharamapuriya dialect is spoken on the north bank of the Ganges. The Chekachekii dialect is spoken in far eastern region where the Rajmahal Hills approach the Ganges near Sahebganj, and in the western border area where the Khirkhiriya Hills stop near the Ganges. Miirzachauki, near Sahebganj, was at the border of the provinces of Bengal and Bihar during the time of Akbar. Miirzachauki was a busy checkpost. It occupied a narrow strip of land between the Ganges and the mountains and thus was an ideal spot for a checkpost. The Mungeriya dialect is prevalent to the west of the Khirkhiriya Hills in the Dakra River basin.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..85"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=85 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Besides these, there are also two mixed sub-dialects of Angika: The first is the Shriipuriya sub-dialect which is used in the region lying between Purnia and Kisanganj. Purnia&#146;s language is Angika, and Bengali is the language of Kisanganj. The Shriipuriya language that is spoken in the interlying areas is a mixture of Angika and Raunapurii Bengali (Su&#x301;ryapurii). The second sub-dialect is the Northern Khotta dialect which is used in the region between Katihar and Maldah. The language of Katihar is Angika, and in Maldah, Bengali. In certain places between the two one can find this Northern Khotta sub-dialect. It is a mixture of Angika and Shershahabad Bengali. In Mungeriya Angika one can find some influence of Magahii. Similarly, in the Magahii of the Kiul River basin there is some influence of Angika.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="5..93"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=93 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;After a few days&#146; search, Vireshvijay came across one of his faithful followers. He entrusted him with the secret plans and maps as well as various urgent matters and sent him to the nawab in Buxar. It was impossible for him to go himself. It would not have been so bad if he himself were caught, but it was essential that the war documents not fall into the hands of the Company. But to the good fortune of the East India Company and the misfortune of Bengal, his follower was caught by the Company near Surajgara. He was killed and the Company learned of the movements of both Vireshvijay and the nawab.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..94"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=94 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;The Company dispatched a large advance army to Buxar and the bank of the Karmanasha River where they laid in ambush waiting to draw up battle formation. Needless to say, Miirkashim lost the battle of Buxar and was completely routed in the battle of the Karmanasha. He had neither manpower nor economic resources. Disheartened, he went first to Zamaniya, then later to Gazipur. At the time Gazipur was under the control of Agra Province. The East India Company&#146;s direct rule had not yet been established there. In poor health and with a broken spirit, Miirkashim breathed his last in Gazipur. The nawab of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa, Miirkashim, died like an ordinary man, or not even, since no one dared to give him a proper burial for fear of the East India Company. Simply a hole was dug and he was thrown in. Even this was washed away and vanished when the Ganges flooded.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="5..96"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=96 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;In fact,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;Vireshvijay was sitting and thinking in the very spot where you are sitting now, thinking and thinking.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..97"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=97 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;I was telling you about Gazipur City. Lord Cornwallis introduced a permanent land settlement for the landed property of Bengal Presidency. Before introducing the land settlement in Bengal, he went first to Gazipur District to make the same arrangements for the province of Agra.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.5.fn15"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#5.fn15">15</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> Gazipur was at that time a huge district. Later, the eastern portion of this district was separated and a new district was formed called Baliya&#x301; (Bahlik). When Cornwallis arrived in Gazipur city he fell ill and died there.

<a name="5..98"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=98 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Yes, since Mughal times, the city of Gazipur has been famous for rosewater and attar.

<a name="5..99"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=99 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Talking about Gazipur reminds me again of Monghyr. Shahjahan&#146;s son, Suja, had the same kind of relationship with Monghyr that Miirkashim had with Gazipur. He fled the country from Monghyr for fear of his life during the Aurangzeb&#146;s invasion. People today still call the wharf that his barge left from, Sujiighat (Suja&#x301;-i-gha&#x301;t&#x301;). Of course, Suja stopped for one night while passing through the city of Bhagalpur in order to draw up his next plans. After that he went to Akiyab, the capital of Arakan, to take shelter with its king.

During Miirka&#x301;shim&#146;s time the Khirkhiriya region was controlled by the king of Dvarabhaun&#x32D;ga from his residential offices in Khar&#x301;agpur.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.5.fn16"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#5.fn16">16</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>

Someone, it seemed, had emptied the cave of all its wealth after King Karna had left. Vireshvijay was only able to get a hold of three Siinaks [a gold coin].&rdquo; Then my visitor pointed out the cave to me with his finger.

Nowadays people have forgotten its history, so they say that it is the ashram of the Rs&#x301;yashrnga Muni mentioned in the Ramayana. Actually there was Buddhist monastery here during the Buddhist era. On the western edge of these mountains you will find the grave of Jamal Minya. Jamal Minya came here from Rajnagar in Birbhum and was the first to propagate Islam in this area. This place was named Jamalpur after him.<!-- /block --></p>

In many districts the district administrator was called the Jila&#x301; Ha&#x301;kim but in Birbhum and Purnia he was called the Bar&#x301;a&#x301; Hakim or governor.

One cannot bear to think about it. What kind of a future would Bengal have? Would Mother Bengal pass her days crying? Would the time he had spent on the earth go in vain? This is what Vireshvijay was thinking that night, seated in this very spot around 8:30 in the evening. Perhaps the next morning the Company would catch up with him. Vireshvijay slowly made his way down to the rain-swollen falls and plunged into its waters. Within moments his body was swept up in the current and carried down into a deep cavern, from there to a lake, then to the Dakra river and finally to the Ganges.

The rapids flung his body around violently and carried him off towards a deep cavern. After that his body sank and disappeared from sight. A sudden strong gust of wind blew at my back from the direction of the forest. Then the gust of wind started blowing towards the mountain in front of me. All around me I could hear the sound <i>son&#x32D;, son&#x32D;, son&#x32D;</i> [[sound of the wind]]. If someone else had been there they would not have heard anything else, but in the middle of this <i>son&#x32D;-son&#x32D;</i> sound I could hear Vireshvijay&#146;s last words <i>ma&#x301;-ma&#x301;-ma&#x301; go</i> [&ldquo;mother, mother, oh my dear mother&rdquo;].

<p class=footnotes_title>Footnotes</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="5.fn1"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.5.fn1">1</a></b>)  At that time in Bengal there used to be three subedars. One was in the capital Murshidabad, the second was in Dacca, and the third was in Azimabad (the name of the railway station in Patna city that has recently been changed to Patna Sahib).)</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="5.fn2"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.5.fn2">2</a></b>)  He also had a few army leaders. He had forts in Sha&#x301;ktigarh (people mistakenly say Sha&#x301;ktigarh), Ta&#x301;litgarh, Pa&#x301;na&#x301;garh, and so forth.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="5.fn3"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.5.fn3">3</a></b>)  Lalbai did not have any kinsmen in India. A distantly related paternal aunt lived in the capital, Agra.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="5.fn4"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.5.fn4">4</a></b>)   The extremely large pond that the king had dug in the name of Lalbai is called Lalbandh. Later the corpse of Lalbai appeared floating in the waters of Lalbandh. In some people&#146;s opinion, the body of Lalbai was not found floating in the waters of Lalbandh but rather her rock-bound skeleton stayed at the bottom.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="5.fn5"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.5.fn5">5</a></b>)   There is a difference of opinion in this matter; in some people&#146;s opinion poison was used.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="5.fn6"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.5.fn6">6</a></b>)   The son of his daughter Amina. She was married to his nephew, Jain-Ud-Diin. Mirza Mohamed was the son of this Amina.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="5.fn7"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.5.fn7">7</a></b>)  A&#x301;mirchand or A&#x301;miinchand. This man, who came from the Punjab, did various kinds of work in the service of the nawab but the majority of his time was spent in Hoogly working for the nawab&#146;s treasury.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="5.fn8"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.5.fn8">8</a></b>)  The majority of Bengali Muslims belong to the Sunni sect &ndash; the Shiahs are nearly all immigrants; in conduct, behaviour, character, language and physical makeup they are distinct from the Bengali people. Practically speaking, there is no intermarriage. They live in small numbers in the urban areas of Murshidabad district. The Muslim rustics are the Bengali people.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="5.fn9"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.5.fn9">9</a></b>)   Generally these &ldquo;Muslim rustics&rdquo; live in those areas where the Shersha&#x301;ha&#x301;ba&#x301;diiya&#x301; dialect is prevalent, that is, they stay chiefly in Murshidabad district, Maldah district, the Bhola&#x301;ha&#x301;t&#x301;, Gomasta&#x301;pur, Na&#x301;col, Shivaganj and Nava&#x301;bganj areas of Ra&#x301;jsha&#x301;hii district, the Nalha&#x301;t&#x301;ii and Mura&#x301;rai areas of Birbhum district, Pa&#x301;kur&#x301;-Ra&#x301;jmahal subdivision and certain parts of Sahebganj and Katihar. They also make their home in the river basins adjacent to Sahebganj. Everywhere they speak Shersha&#x301;ha&#x301;ba&#x301;diiya&#x301; Bengali. They are original Bengalees, extremely straightforward, hardworking, and they keep away from all kinds of falsehood or crookedness. I have seen that many people take advantage of any opportunity to cheat them. Something should be done for them.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="5.fn10"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.5.fn10">10</a></b>)  It may be at this time that Angadesh got its first capital. Today Campanagar is located a little to the west of Bhagalpur, near the Nathanagar railway station.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="5.fn11"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.5.fn11">11</a></b>)   The Karnacaora palace of present-day Monghyr bears no relation to the Karna of the Mahabharata. The palace was built at the very end of the Pathan era or at the beginning of the Mughal era. Karnacaora is not actually the name of the palace but the name of the place. Karna, it seems, had his residence in this place.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="5.fn12"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.5.fn12">12</a></b>)  The present-day Mora&#x301;m&#x301; district of Nepal and bordering area (Viratnagar) belonged then to Angadesh.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="5.fn13"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.5.fn13">13</a></b>)   Chiir-Chandan-Baruya/A&#x301;or sab bhar&#x301;u&#x301;ya&#x301; &ndash; These Chiir, Chandan, and Baruya are the main rivers; the rest don&#146;t deserve to be called rivers.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="5.fn14"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.5.fn14">14</a></b>)   Ciiracandanayormadhye manda&#x301;ra na&#x301;ma parvatah. [The Manda&#x301;r is the name of the mountain between the Chiir and the Chandan.]</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="5.fn15"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.5.fn15">15</a></b>)  At that time Agra and Ayodhya were separate provinces. Subsequently, when the East India Company conquered the two regions they joined them and gave them the name: United Provinces of Agra and Oudh (abbreviated UP) The name UP is still prevalent today in India, however, now its name has become Uttar Pradesh [Northern Province].</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="5.fn16"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.5.fn16">16</a></b>)  In those days there were two well-known Kharagpurs in Bengal. One was Ha&#x301;belii Khar&#x301;agpur in Monghyr (Ha&#x301;belii means a city which is surrounded by a wall) and the other was Hijlii Karagpur in Hijlii district. Later the name of Hijlii district was changed to Midnapore district. The city is still in good shape today. It takes its name from the Jain God, Khar&#x301;geshvar Shiva. At that time the Kam&#x301;sa&#x301;vatii River basin was one of the centres of Digambar Jain Tantra (a mendicant Jain sect that goes naked).</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="5.fn17"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.5.fn17">17</a></b>)  Shaokatjang was Nawab Siraj-ud-Daloa&#146;s uncle [mother&#146;s sister&#146;s husband] &ndash; there is some difference of opinion here.</p>

At the time I was working in the hilly wilds around Gaya searching for the deep, hidden similarities between the pre-Buddhist Magadha civilization and the ancient civilization of Rarh. I had found a striking similarity between the two and had never before felt such excitement and enthusiasm in my research. In terms of my river valley research I was concentrating then on the Naerain&#x32D;jana&#x301;-Mohaniya&#x301;-Phalgu River basin.<!-- /block --></p>

Sleep came on quickly. Ah yes, before sleeping I noticed a white stone iitr-pot in one corner of the dressing table, a Gayan artifact of ancient Ma&#x301;gadhii culture.

<a name="6..32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;I am a child of Magadha. History has never done full justice to this land of Magadha. Every dust particle of its villages and markets is mixed with the gold-dust of its heritage but no one has properly recognized it or recorded it. The little that has been written about it has been written by foreign historians &ndash; some out of sport, some out of merriment. The shrivelled Phalgu that you see today was not always in this condition. The hills of southern Magadha were once covered with dense forests. Beyond the mountains, from the north to the south, the Ma&#x301;gadhii river valley was also covered with thick forests. Even a portion of the plains and the banks of the river were also forested. This heavily-forested Magadha used to enjoy an abundance of rainfall and thus the rivers were full of water twelve months out of the year. Because of the abundance of forests there was no problem of soil erosion, and because the forests contained the water there was very little severe flooding. Seeing the Magadha of today, it is difficult to imagine the lush green Magadha that once was.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;You are certainly aware of the fact that Magadha was once a vast empire. At the time of Ashoka and Samudragupta it was probably the largest empire in the world but nothing lasts forever. Those glorious days came to an end and a cimmerian darkness descended over Magadha. The most difficult days in Magadha&#146;s history drew nigh during the reign of Skandagupta.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Tell me a little more, in brief.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->He went on. &ldquo;Skandagupta was one in a string of unworthy sovereigns to occupy the throne of Magadha. At that time the empire had disintegrated and the kingdom was on the point of collapse, confined to its ancient borders. To the north was the Ganges and north of that Mithila, which was at one time part of the empire of Magadha and which Rarh&#146;s King Shasha&#x301;un&#x32D;ka had wrested from the hands of Magadha. To the east were the Grdhraku&#x301;t&#x301;a and Cakravarttii mountains. In the eastern region of the Grdhraku&#x301;t&#x301;a Mountains was Angadesh and the Magadha Empire. King Shasha&#x301;un&#x32D;ka of Rarh also took possession of these areas. In the eastern regions of the Cakravarttii Mountains was the land of Rarh, which came under Shasha&#x301;un&#x32D;ka&#146;s direct rule. The southeast corner&#146;s border was Sametashikhar. After that was ancient Rarh, which the king of Rarh had conquered. The southern portion of the Ramgarh Mountains to the south and the western portion of the Shon&#x301;a River to the west were first controlled by the king of Kashii, Citrasena. After his fall, this entire area was controlled by the royal house of Tha&#x301;niishvar. Magadha did not have a direct struggle with Prabha&#x301;karavarddhana but rather with Ra&#x301;jyavarddhana and Hars&#x301;avarddhana.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..36"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph -->&ldquo; I&#146;ve gone on quite a bit about the borders of Magadha at that time. I hope you didn&#146;t mind. Without it the picture would not be complete.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="6..39"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=39 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Of course, nothing in this world is completely one-sided. No matter how much historians blame him, Skandagupta did some good also. This city of Gaya, which we are standing in the heart of, was designed by him. He founded Sanskrit schools and training centres in various parts of Magadha, such as Dva&#x301;dashavarddhaka&#x301; (Va&#x301;ravigha), Brhaddhika&#x301; (Var&#x301;ahiya&#x301;), Madhukamadha&#x301; (Moka&#x301;ma&#x301;), Urubilva (Araba&#x301;l), Grdhraku&#x301;t&#x301;a (Gidhaor&#x301;), and so forth, which endured for quite some time. He was the first to introduce the use of the Ma&#x301;gadhii language of that time (Western Demi-Ma&#x301;gadhii) in government service alongside Sanskrit. Still, he watched the Magadha Empire crumble in front of his eyes. He died watching an entire empire fall apart due to his own incompetence.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..40"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=40 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;At that time there was a fierce struggle going on for the capture of Magadha between King Ra&#x301;jyavarddhana of the royal house of Tha&#x301;niisvar and Rarh&#146;s King Shasha&#x301;un&#x32D;ka. Tha&#x301;nisvara&#146;s kings used to repeatedly move their capital from place to place, but Shasha&#x301;un&#x32D;ka did not. Rather, he would enlarge his capital according to necessity and befitting the times. He founded Pain&#x32D;cagaorh [the five ancient parts of Bengal] after capturing Anga and Mithila&#x301; and then North Bengal (Barendra), Central Bengal (Samatat&#x301;) and East Bengal (Vaun&#x32D;ga).

Although Ra&#x301;jyavarddhana put on a show of liberality he was really narrow-minded. In actual fact, he never treated the Shaivite religion as equal to the Buddhist religion. Shasha&#x301;un&#x32D;ka was a staunch follower of Shaivism and completely against Buddhism. He openly declared that as long as one drop of blood remained in his body, he would not allow Buddhism the right to enter either Rarh nor Pain&#x32D;cagaor&#x301;a,<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.6.fn8"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#6.fn8">8</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  or Bengal.<!-- /block --></p>

There was no other region in all of India which was as fertile and as affluent at that time. Thus everyone had their greedy eyes set on Ambabhu&#x301;mi. Ra&#x301;jyavarddhana and Shasha&#x301;un&#x32D;ka were no exceptions.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..43"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=43 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Their style of attack, however, differed.

Shasha&#x301;un&#x32D;ka&#146;s aim was to destroy Buddhist monasteries (what are now called gar&#x301;a in modern Magahii) and Mahayana Buddhist images and idols. You are certainly aware of the fact that, according to social and religious regulations, idols can no longer be used for worship once there is any defect or deformation in them.

Ra&#x301;jyashrii returned to her father&#146;s house and instigated her brothers, Ra&#x301;jyavarddhana and Hars&#x301;avarddhana, to turn against Rarh.

Just as the geography of Magadha slopes downwards from north to south and the rivers flow from north to south, similarly the culture and civilization flowed from south to north. Thus the people of Rarh and Magadha are fundamentally one. Like the people of Rarh, the common people of Magadha are dark-skinned. Magadha borders Rarh along its south-east border. The skin and bodily structure of the people of Rarh and Magadha are identical. There is also a noticeable similarity between their languages.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..53"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=53 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Earlier I told you that in those days Magadha was full of forests and had abundant rainfall so there was no need of irrigation. The pre-Aryan people of Magadha used to believe that their land received rainfall due to the grace of the sun-god. Thus they used to worship the sun-god according to their ancient local customs, once during the autumn paddy harvest and again during the spring sun harvest (chaetii harvest). This sun-worship of pre-Aryan Magadha is known today as chat&#x301; pu&#x301;ja&#x301;. This worship was not performed according to Aryan rules. It was a completely local Magadha practice. The people of Magadha did not bow their heads and submissively accept any of the Aryan practices. For that reason the Aryans called the land magadha. They were afraid of Magadha and used to pay it respect. Thus, to satisfy their grudge and vent their spite, they declared Magadha an unholy land. They said that if a man died there he would not go to heaven and they made efforts to forcibly impose their language, culture and civilization on Magadha. It is up to the historians and social scientists to consider just how successful they were in their efforts.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..54"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=54 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Magadha did not accept the Aryan civilization. In ancient Magadha there was no custom of racial or caste divisions. The caste system in Magadha came much later due to the influence of the Aryans. Even after the advent of the caste system, the Kraoin&#x32D;cadviipii and Magadha&#146;s Shrotriya Brahmins did not like the severity of caste divisions. For this reason the Kraoin&#x32D;cadviipii and Magadha&#146;s Shrotriya Brahmins were not recognized by the Brahmins of northern India.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="6..58"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=58 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;It was an unbelievable and unforgettable happening. Nearly two and a half thousand years ago two great spiritual leaders appeared on the earth at about the same time on the soil of Magadha to sow there the seeds of their spiritual teachings. One was Vardhama&#x301;na Maha&#x301;viira and the other was Gaotama Buddha. Gaotama Buddha was the son of the feudal king of the central terai, Shuddhodana (Malla dynasty, Sha&#x301;kya branch of the Ks&#x301;atriyas), and his wife Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;devii. He practised austerities for a long time in Magadha in the areas of the Bara&#x301;bar, Brahmayoni and Grdhraku&#x301;t&#x301; mountains. His Guru in Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya philosophy, A&#x301;ca&#x301;rya Sain&#x32D;jaya (Nawada district), was also from Magadha. Although what is called avidya in his philosophy is not the same as pradha&#x301;na or prakrti in Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya, there is some similarity between the Buddha&#146;s concept of avidya and the Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya concept of pradha&#x301;na.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..59"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=59 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;The Buddha attained enlightenment in the village of Urubilva, located on the bank of the river Naerain&#x32D;jana&#x301; (Urubilva is called Bodhgaya today). That Suja&#x301;ta&#x301; who fed him ks&#x301;iira [rice pudding] and saved his life at that moment when the period of his radiant austerities had brought him to the point of death, was Buddha&#146;s cousin and the wife of a certain feudal king of Magadha. One should remember here that at that time the Naerain&#x32D;jana&#x301; river coming from the south joined the Mohanika&#x301; (Mohaniya&#x301;) river near Urubilva and flowed together as the Phalgu river from there, later joining the Ganges near Modhukamadha&#x301; (Moka&#x301;ma&#x301;). About 2000 years ago the two rivers underwent some physical changes due to a huge earthquake and for that reason the Phalgu river of today is much smaller than it was.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..60"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=60 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;At any rate the prince of the Shakyas, Gaotama, attained enlightenment on Magadha soil. Many say that Buddha first introduced the Buddhist dharmacakra [wheel of dharma] and initiated his first disciple near Benares in the Is&#x301;ipattana Migada&#x301;ba (Rs&#x301;ipattana deer grove, alias Sa&#x301;rangana&#x301;th or Sa&#x301;rana&#x301;th). Although this is partially correct, it is not the complete truth. It is certainly true that he introduced the dharmacakra in the Is&#x301;ipattana deer grove and that his five disciples, Kaon&#x301;d&#x301;inya (Kaon&#x301;dilya), Bappa (Vapra), Bhaddiiya (Bhadreya), Moha&#x301;na&#x301;ma, and Ashsha&#x301;ji (Ashvajit), were present there. But he gave his first initiations on Magadha soil &ndash; to Sa&#x301;riputta, the son of Ru&#x301;pasa&#x301;ri, and Maha&#x301;moggallan Arhan, the son of Maha&#x301;moggalii.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..61"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=61 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;In those days Magadha&#146;s matriarchal system still retained some influence alongside the patriarchal system. So Buddha&#146;s first two disciples in Magadha were known by their mother&#146;s names. The merchant that the city of Pa&#x301;t&#x301;aliiputra was named after due to his philanthropy also carried his mother&#146;s name in accordance with the matriarchal system.

Like the Buddha, however, he did not propagate his teachings first in his native land but came to Magadha to do so.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..63"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=63 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;One does not have to go far to find the reason why both of them selected Magadha as the proper place for their work. Magadha was not bound hand and foot with the bonds of the Vedic religion. Their natural liberal mentality gushed forth in all aspects of their lives. Buddha was successful in spreading his spiritual teachings there because they were based more on logic than on superstition and belief. Of course, the spirit of revolt against conventionality was present in Varddhanama&#x301;na Maha&#x301;viira&#146;s teachings also, but in the opinion of the Magahii people his doctrine of ahim&#x301;sa&#x301; [non-violence] did not accord well with reality so they were not able to accept it easily. Of course, some people did accept it, but others considered him an unrealistic theoretician and tried to bring him down to earth by using occult powers. Thus he felt the need to go elsewhere to propagate his new religion.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..64"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=64 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;At that time the most famous city for progressive thinking, education and culture was A&#x301;stikanagar (Atthinagar), the capital of Rarh. Varddhama&#x301;n Maha&#x301;viira went there and stayed nearly eight years. There he managed to fit his doctrine of ahim&#x301;sa&#x301; into a somewhat realistic framework. Some prominent merchants of A&#x301;stikanagar accepted his doctrine and they renamed the city Varddhama&#x301;n [Burdwan] after him. Thus it is said that the Jain religion was first established in Rarh.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..65"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=65 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Thereafter he took the road back to Magadha from Burdwan and stopped for a short time in a small village named Sva&#x301;miistha&#x301;na (Sva&#x301;miistha&#x301;n &rarr; Sa&#x301;inchittha&#x301;n &rarr; Sa&#x301;inchithiincha&#x301; &rarr; Sainthiya&#x301;) on the banks of the Mayu&#x301;ra&#x301;ks&#x301;ii River to preach his gospels.

<a name="6..74"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=74 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;This Ma&#x301;gadhii Pra&#x301;krta had two daughters &ndash; Eastern Demi-Ma&#x301;gadhii and Western Demi-Ma&#x301;gadhii. Western Demi-Ma&#x301;gadhii later gave birth to the Magahii language. At one time Ma&#x301;gadhii Pra&#x301;krta was used not only in eastern India, but in central India as well among the educated community for the exchange of thoughts. Educated people used to show the same zeal for learning Ma&#x301;gadhii Pra&#x301;krta as they showed for learning Sanskrit. The structure of the Ma&#x301;gadhii Pra&#x301;krta language is both straighforward and easy. The grammar is also not complex. Both Maha&#x301;viira and Buddha gave their teachings in the Ma&#x301;gadhii Pra&#x301;krta of that time which many people today call Pa&#x301;li. A great deal of literature was composed in the Pa&#x301;li language and its successor Occidental Demi-Ma&#x301;gadhii. Magadha also had its own script. Inscriptions in that ancient Ma&#x301;gadhii script can still be found in certain places in Bodhgaya.

Shasha&#x301;un&#x32D;ka was an intelligent and courageous man. He built a large army through whatever means he had at his disposal and took Ra&#x301;jyavarddhana by surprise when his adversary was temporarily absent from his capital, taking possession of the city. After this he waged a fierce war against Ra&#x301;jyavarddhana in which Ra&#x301;jyavarddhana was defeated and slain. Some people claim that under the pretence of a truce, Shasha&#x301;un&#x32D;ka extended an invitation to Ra&#x301;jyavarddhana, and then either stabbed or poisoned him when he came. One can say what one wants in this matter but there is no sound historical evidence that Shasha&#x301;un&#x32D;ka killed Ra&#x301;jyavarddhana unfairly.<!-- /block --></p>

Har&#x301;savarddhana did not let this opportunity go by and struck a powerful blow against Rarh. War ensued and after two sanguinary battles at Nalha&#x301;t&#x301;i and Parkat&#x301;iipur (Pa&#x301;kur&#x301;), Rarh fell under Hars&#x301;avarddhana&#146;s control. The same Hars&#x301;avarddhana who has achieved everlasting fame in India, who, as legend has it, was known for his generosity and who, in some people&#146;s opinion, was the founder of the Kumbhamela&#x301; and the Ma&#x301;ghamela&#x301;, also killed Rarh&#146;s Queen Jayashankarii and her under-age son, Mrga&#x301;nkashekhara, with his own hand,  and utterly exploited Magadha, tossing it aside like a worn-out banana peel. According to the scriptures, the elderly, women, the sick, the disabled, conscientious dissenters, under-age men, and emissaries must not be killed. Hars&#x301;avarddhana blatantly violated this scriptural injunction. Both the people of Bengal and the people of Magadha condemned and censured him for this.<!-- /block --></p>

In their hearts the people remained Shaivites but on the outside they became Buddhists. Later on, during the time of Shankaracharya, a small number of Rarh&#146;s Jains and large numbers of Buddhists throughout Bengal accepted the Puranic religion. This may have been because in Rarh there was some similarity between the traditions of the Puranic religion and the Digambar Jain doctrine of that time.

The name of Ra&#x301;ma&#146;s wife was Siita&#x301;. The word siita&#x301; means &ldquo;land which has been tilled with a plough&rdquo;. There is a story that Maharshi Janaka pulled Siita&#x301; from the bosom of the earth while he was ploughing his land. Thus he gave his foster daughter the name Siita&#x301;</p>

In the pre-Jain era the city&#146;s name was A&#x301;stikanagar or Atthinagar. Since the Jain era it has been called Vardhama&#x301;na [British spelling Burdwan] after Vardhama&#x301;na Maha&#x301;viira.</p>

<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="6.fn9"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.6.fn9">9</a></b>)   Even today, the Kayasthas of Ambabhu&#x301;mi still use Ambas&#x301;t&#x301;ha as a surname.</p>

The collective name of cows and buffaloes, or milk-giving animals, is cattle. The place where they stay is called ba&#x301;tha&#x301;n in colloquial language and gos&#x301;t&#x301;ha in Sanskrit.</p>

<a name="7..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->At any rate, when the Europeans came to India at the end of the Mughal Era they brought with them their palanquin which in Bengali was called pa&#x301;lki. The British introduced it in Calcutta. The bearers were mostly from Orissa. The fare was one paisa per mile.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.7.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#7.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  They petitioned to have the fare increased to one and a half per mile. When their petition was not approved they held a strike for several days. Then the English with their inventive intellect designed the pa&#x301;lki ga&#x301;r&#x301;ii or bagi [bogey] ga&#x301;r&#x301;ii  and provided for it to be drawn by horses. In this way we got today&#146;s horse-drawn carriage. A single carriage is called a &ldquo;bogey&rdquo; in English. The pa&#x301;lki carriage had the convenience of the pa&#x301;lki and because it was horse-drawn it could go faster as well. As a result, after a short time the horse-drawn carriage became favoured by the people over the traditional palanquin. So the palanquin&#146;s days slowly came to a close; its fares also decreased. However, it managed to survive in villages where there were no proper roads that the horse-drawn carriages could travel.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Similar to the ekka&#x301;-t&#x301;omt&#x301;om carriage in India was the phaeton carriage in Europe. The gentlemen of Calcutta used to ride in these phaeton carriages and enjoy the open air in the Esplanade. The pa&#x301;lki carriage gradually replaced the phaeton carriage because the women of this country who normally lived in seclusion at home did not like to ride in the open phaetons. They used to ride in the pa&#x301;lki carriages to maintain their sanctity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->The days of the ekka&#x301; also came to an end, pushed out by the pa&#x301;lki carriage. Only in those cases where the roads were poor or where there was a need to bring heavy loads of vegetables to the local market, did the ekka&#x301; carriage survive. It still survives today in a few places where cycles and rickshaws cannot do precisely this kind of work. Moreover, cycles and rickshaws need somewhat better roads than the ekka&#x301; does.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Speaking of the ekka&#x301;, a story comes to mind in which the ekka&#x301; plays an important role.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->I had gone at the time to a village in Nawada subdivision of Gaya district in search of archaeological artifacts from Magadha. This place was more or less in the Ks&#x301;uri river basin. At the southwest it bordered the historically renowned Grdhraku&#x301;t&#x301; mountain where the Buddha performed spiritual austerities and later gave his spiritual teaching.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->I was somewhat late returning. Though it was night there was no harm done because the night train from Gaya would pass through Nawada station quite late. The train was running late and dawn was breaking when I arrived home in Jamalpur.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->It was the full moon night in the middle of Hemanta<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.7.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#7.fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> and a cool breeze was blowing; I had no trouble seeing even without a torch. I was feeling quite happy after having verified several important facts. The issue under consideration was whether or not the Buddhist Mantraya&#x301;na was dominant in Magadha during the middle of the Buddhist era or the Ka&#x301;lacakraya&#x301;na. In the Buddhist Mantraya&#x301;na they recognized the goddess (which also happened later in Tantra and the Puranic religion) and she was also honored in the Buddhist Ka&#x301;lacakraya&#x301;na, but the two were divided along doctrinal lines &ndash; one accepted Vajrata&#x301;ra&#x301; and the other Niilta&#x301;ra&#x301; or Niil Saraswatii.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.7.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#7.fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> With the passage of time Niil Saraswatii took the form of Prajin&#x32D;a&#x301;pa&#x301;ramita&#x301; in Tibet and later Prajin&#x32D;a&#x301;pa&#x301;ramita&#x301; was accepted in India by the followers of Maha&#x301;ya&#x301;na. At the outset, Prajin&#x32D;a&#x301;pa&#x301;ramita&#x301; and Niil Saraswatii were considered to be one and the same, but later they became separate goddesses. In the beginning, their Dhya&#x301;namantra was also the same, but it also became different afterwards.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->In Magadha I found the whole or broken statues or remainders of destroyed statues of Niil Ta&#x301;ra&#x301;, Ugrata&#x301;ra&#x301;, Bhra&#x301;mariita&#x301;ra&#x301;, and Prajin&#x32D;a&#x301;pa&#x301;ramita&#x301;. From this I arrived at the firm conclusion that they were accepted in Magadha despite the divisions that took place on or outside of Magadha soil.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->I was walking in the direction of Nawada station, the station still about six miles away, when I saw a pond on the left side of the road. In Magadha there are very few ponds but during the Buddhist era ponds were often dug next to Buddhist monasteries because many mendicants and students used to stay there and a great deal of water was needed for them for which a well would not be sufficient.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->When I saw the pond I stopped. I thought that perhaps there might be a garh<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.7.fn5"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#7.fn5">5</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> nearby. There was no garh to be seen but I did see a tall mound next to the pond. If one sat on one side of the mound then the other side was not visible but if one stood one could see all the way around it. I sat on one side of the mound and started pondering &ndash; I had never heard of the existence of a Buddhist monastery in such a place. But then whose mound was this?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Suddenly I saw an ekka&#x301; coming down the same path by which I had come. It came to halt in front of me and, lo and behold!, there was no driver, no one at the reins. The horse knew the path and brought the vehicle there. Just as it pulled up, a young gentleman appeared from the other side of the mound. I asked him in Magahii: &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; He greeted me with folded hands and said with a slight smile: &ldquo;Look, it seems perhaps that the ekka&#x301; has come for you.

<a name="7..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Don&#146;t worry about it. I can drive the ekka&#x301;.&rdquo; Saying this, he helped me get in the ekka&#x301; and then jumped into the driver&#146;s seat himself and started to drive.<!-- /block --></p>

Their main place was Vikramman&#x301;ipur&#146;s (Vikrampur) Vajrayoginii village in Bengal (the village name is Badarajoinii). Statues of Vajrayoginii and Vajraba&#x301;ra&#x301;hii were also found in old Tripura&#146;s Mayana&#x301;matii (subsequently British Tripura or Kumilla&#x301; district) and Dattapa&#x301;r&#x301;a&#x301; village of Bhuluya&#x301;.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

I was very happy to see that you are doing research on Magadha&#146;s archaeological wealth. Actually, I didn&#146;t just come here; I&#146;ve been with you secretly all along.

When the Sepoy Mutiny first started in Barrackpore and Berhampore, the thought of liberating the country was not in the smallest corner of their minds.<!-- /block --></p>

Thus we can say that this time saw the sprouting of the seed of desire for independence. The rulers of East Bengal and Assam Province at the time completely lost their senses, like a mad dog, in the effort to suppress the movement. As a result, &lsquo;terrorism as an effect of helplessness complex&rsquo; arose among the oppressed and persecuted Bengali population.

The police chief of East Bengal and Assam Province, Mr. Tegartt, scoured the region in a furious effort to capture them. Thereafter they quit East Bengal and Assam and came to Bengal where they continued to conduct their terrorist activities from Nawada in Gaya district.

Geo-sentiment and racial sentiment alone are not all there is to freedom. External forces ruled this country because they were able to extract its essence, its vital juices. When they saw that they had to expend a lot of money to maintain the sugar cane production, when they saw that it was no longer profitable after having sucked the industry dry, then they left. They did not go due to any other pressure; economic difficulties forced them to leave. It is important to remember, both then and now, that it cannot be called freedom when black exploiters take the place of white exploiters. Even though the foreign powers have left, their exploitative machinery is still in place. That machinery will have to go.

A tributary breaks off from the middle part of this icha&#x301;matii on its right-hand side and joins the Bha&#x301;girathi near Shantipur. This tributary is known by the name of the Churni.

<p class=footnotes_title>Footnotes</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="7.fn1"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.7.fn1">1</a></b>)  In Old Bengal, the people who used to carry the palanquin were called duliya&#x301; or dule. In the Bengali army there were large numbers of bagdiis [a Hindu caste] During battle the duliya&#x301; or dule ba&#x301;gdiis used to help them by carrying their palanquins.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="7.fn2"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.7.fn2">2</a></b>)   In those days the half-paisa coin was quite common in the market and was worth something as well. Officially the pie-paisa was in use but practically it was the half-paisa or adhla&#x301;. In my childhood days in Bihar one could get four kacuri [a kind of pancake made from pulse] and vegetables for one adhla&#x301;.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="7.fn3"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.7.fn3">3</a></b>)  The Bengali year has six seasons. Hemanta corresponds to the end of autumn and beginning of winter. &ndash;Trans.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="7.fn4"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.7.fn4">4</a></b>)  In many people&#146;s opinion this Niil Saraswatii was later transformed into the white-coloured Puranic goddess Saraswatii. Up until the time of British rule what people meant by the worship of Saraswatii was the worship of books. After the first statue of Saraswatii was made during British rule the Saraswatii puja was introduced. The Saraswatii of the Vedic and post-Vedic eras and the Saraswatii which is worshipped today are not the same. The Dhyanamantra of the modern Saraswatii, Ya kundendu tus&#x301;a&#x301;raha&#x301;ra dhavala&#x301;, [who is as white as the kunda flower and as glittering as a string of icicles] is not an ancient mantra.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="7.fn5"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.7.fn5">5</a></b>)  In Magadha the common people call the ruins of an ancient Buddhist monastery a garh [fort].</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="7.fn6"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.7.fn6">6</a></b>)  Kaoya&#x301;kol is now a small town.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="7.fn7"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.7.fn7">7</a></b>)  The first two words of a song by Bakim Chandra eulogizing the motherland &ndash; &ldquo;we salute thee, O mother&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="7.fn8"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.7.fn8">8</a></b>)  When the two Bengals were reunited in 1912, the East Bengal and Assam Province&#146;s Secretariat at Dhaka, its capital, was divided; the newly-created Province of Assam had its capital removed to Shillong and the newly-created Province of Bihar-Chotana&#x301;gpur-Orissa had its capital removed to Patna. The word Chotanagpur was dropped from the name of the Province later on.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="7.fn9"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.7.fn9">9</a></b>)  The Ka&#x301;lindii river means &ldquo;black river&rdquo;, or that river whose waters are black.</p>
