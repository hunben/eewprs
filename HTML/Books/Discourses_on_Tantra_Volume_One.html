<a name="1..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The many features of Tantra which distinguish it from other spiritual traditions make definition difficult within a short space. But if we are to focus on the single most characteristic of Tantra&#146;s distinguishing features, surely that must be the spirit of fight. Shrii Shrii A&#x301;nandamu&#x301;rti has said,<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..2"></a><p class="Para_Quote"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The main characteristic of Tantra is that it represents human vigour. It represents a pactless fight. Where there is no fight there is no sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. Under such circumstances Tantra cannot be there, where there is no sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, no fight. It is an impossibility to conquer a crude idea and to replace it by a subtle idea without a fight. It is not at all possible without sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. Hence, Tantra is not only a fight, it is an all-round fight. (&ldquo;Tantra and Its Effect on Society&rdquo;, in Volume Two)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Tantra finds or creates circumstances designed expressly to bring out, rather than to intern away, one&#146;s problematic mental tendencies. &ldquo;A practitioner of Tantra becomes elevated and attains mastery over a hostile environment. Tantra does not accept the teaching of the Vedas that human beings should move internally, and carefully avoid any association with their environment&rdquo; (&ldquo;The Fundamental Difference between Tantra and Veda&rdquo;, in Volume Two). So only if a spiritual path at some stage deliberately seeks out fearful, demoralizing or tempting circumstances in order to fight and overcome them by Cosmic ideation and by trust in the guru, does it deserve to be called Tantric.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..4"></a><p class="Para_Quote"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->It is not only an external or internal fight, it is simultaneously both. The internal fight is a practice of the subtler portion of Tantra. The external fight is a fight of the cruder portion of Tantra. And the fight both external and internal is a fight in both ways at once. So practice in each and every stratum of life receives due recognition in Tantra.&#8230; The practice for raising the kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii is the internal sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; of Tantra, while shattering the bondages of hatred, suspicion, fear, shyness, etc., by direct action is the external sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. (&ldquo;Effect&rdquo;)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Both the &ldquo;internal fight&rdquo; and the &ldquo;external fight&rdquo; refer to the fight against internal enemies &ndash; but the latter uses external means to intensify the fight.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..6"></a><p class="Para_Quote"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->The very first night that a Tantric goes to the burial ground, he is stricken with fear.&#8230; But when he returns home after finishing sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, the mind is much lighter than before. When he goes out for sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; the next night, he is much less fearful. And thus the Tantric steadily and slowly overcomes fear. This is the applied process of Tantra which will help the practitioner overcome all instincts. (&ldquo;Fundamental Difference&rdquo;)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Though practices such as that of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; in a burial ground may be the clearest instances of techniques designed to bring to the surface one&#146;s mental propensities, such practices are not required of all Tantrics. But all Tantrics are brought face to face with their weaknesses in one way or other. A Tantric guru assigns to his disciples tremendous responsibilities for social change. The disciples&#146; participation in an activist movement aimed at a just and spiritually-based society forces them to confront sometimes physical fear, but more routinely the fear of social censure and the fear of the overwhelming task before them. The inferiority complex is the most debilitating fear which most of us must learn to overcome in our lives.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..8"></a><p class="Para_Quote"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Tantra advises: Jump into your environment without the least hesitation. Don&#146;t be afraid. Fear will leave you step by step. Tomorrow you will not be as fearful as you are today, the day after you will be even less fearful, and ten days from now you&#146;ll notice that you are completely fearless.

<a name="1..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->In 1967 in Allahabad Shrii Shrii A&#x301;nandamu&#x301;rti gave an important discourse on Tantra which was not recorded or fully transcribed at the time. Fortunately one of A&#x301;nandamu&#x301;rtijii&#146;s disciples is confident of having retained a clear memory of it, and has transmitted the main ideas in an article written in 1991.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.1.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#1.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> (A fellow disciple who attended the same discourse took some notes which corroborate the basic content of the article.) Because of its deep relevance to the topic of Tantric History, covered in Part 3 of this volume, it deserves to be mentioned here. Beginning on page 29 of the article we find:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..10"></a><p class="Para_Quote"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Tantra, though a singular science, developed into five branches during the Paora&#x301;n&#x301;ik period of Indian history.&#8230;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..11"></a><p class="Para_Quote"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->According to the Shaeva Cult.&#8230; Human beings should direct all the expressions of their life towards the inner world and finally merge into the Supreme Cognition.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..12"></a><p class="Para_Quote"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u is the Entity that pervades each and every thing of this universe.&#8230; [So the Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava Cult is] the cult of divine love.&#8230;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..13"></a><p class="Para_Quote"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->The Shakti Cult lays great stress on the attainment of power and its judicious application.&#8230;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..14"></a><p class="Para_Quote"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Gan&#x301;esha or Gan&#x301;apati&#8230; is the deification of the leader of the tribe in ancient times. The head and trunk of an elephant placed on his torso signify a warrior society led by the strong and sturdy leader of the tribe.&#8230; When the ancient custom of group leadership was converted into a cult during the Paora&#x301;n&#x301;ik age, the idea was adopted that the group leader was the leader of the universe.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..15"></a><p class="Para_Quote"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->The Saora Cult.&#8230; like the sun which is the nucleus of our solar system.&#8230; God is the Supreme Nucleus of this entire creation.&#8230; All the units revolve around Him. Salvation is possible only when the unit consciousness merges into Him.&#8230;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..16"></a><p class="Para_Quote"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Shrii Shrii A&#x301;nandamu&#x301;rti.&#8230; synthesized the Pain&#x32D;ca Tantra [the above five well-known schools of Tantra] into a singular cult by including the salient features of all of them.&#8230; A&#x301;nanda Ma&#x301;rga is a spiritual cult where the goal is the attainment of Supreme Cognition. In this respect it is Shaeva; but to attain this spiritual rank one needs psychic and spiritual strength for which proper sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is required. So in practice it is Sha&#x301;kta.&#8230; The Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava Cult teaches us how to live in joy and peace with the entire creation. Hence in society one must be a Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava.&#8230; Saora Tantra teaches the secret of introverting the extroverted energies leading towards the Supreme Hub.&#8230; Collective life [must be] systematised, regulated and directed towards the Supreme Goal.&#8230; Ga&#x301;n&#x301;apatya Tantra [in which the Supreme is personified as a divinized tribal leader] is devised to achieve this objective.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Shrii Shrii A&#x301;nandamu&#x301;rti often spoke of having modified Tantra &ldquo;to suit the needs of the modern era&rdquo;. He furthermore elaborated the philosophy of Tantra along lines which had previously been little developed.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Out of the tremendous number of darshans, or discourses, which A&#x301;nandamu&#x301;rtijii gave on a great range of subjects during thirty-seven years as preceptor of Ananda Marga, a great many have been carefully preserved in published form and/or on tape. We have drawn on this wealth for the present collection by first assembling all the discourses or sections thereof which related to the topic of Tantra; and by then electing to include all but that handful which were found to contain only material already covered in other articles. Though the subject matter may be virtually the same, each discourse will be found to have its own special appeal, and we recommend these discourses to readers, though regrettably they could not be included here. Those related to the topics of this volume are:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..19"></a><p class="Para_Quote"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->A paragraph on Tantra from the Buddhism section of &ldquo;Views of Other Faiths&rdquo; in Ta&#x301;ttvika Praveshika&#x301; or Philosophy in a Nutshell 3. The Incarnation, Ta&#x301;raka Brahma and Sadguru section of &ldquo;Basic Principles of Spiritual Philosophy&rdquo; in Notes on Spiritual Philosophy. &ldquo;The Macrocosm and the Microcosm &ndash; 2&rdquo; in Subha&#x301;s&#x301;ita Sam&#x301;graha 7 or Ideology and Way of Life 9.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->To assist researchers, it is our policy to indicate here &ndash; in addition to the original language of each speech, the date and place, by whom it was translated, and where, if at all, it was previously published &ndash; whether or not a tape of the speech is in existence. At the time of this printing, however, not all the cataloguing of tapes has been finished. Further information as to tapes will be given in future printings.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->In all cases where a tape was in existence for a discourse given in English, we have re-edited the published discourse with reference to that tape.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->The abbreviation &ldquo;DMC&rdquo; sometimes appears at the end of a discourse. Dharma Maha&#x301;cakra was a special spiritual gathering addressed by the preceptor, the guru. The abbreviation &ldquo;RU&rdquo; at the end of a discourse indicates that the discourse constituted a Presidential speech to Renaissance Universal.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Square brackets [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;] in the text are used to indicate translations by the editors or other editorial insertions, for instance, &ldquo;&#8230; loka&#x301;yata [mundane]&#8230;&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Now in [Shambhu&#x301;liun&#x32D;ga], the human entity is in subtlest form.&#8230;&rdquo; Round brackets (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) indicate a word or words originally given by the author.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->The author used a certain shorthand for explaining the etymologies of words. Under this system, a minus sign (&ndash;) follows a prefix, and a plus sign (+) precedes a suffix. Thus ava &ndash; tr + ghain&#x32D; = avata&#x301;ra can be read, &ldquo;the root tr prefixed by ava and suffixed by ghain&#x32D; becomes avata&#x301;ra.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->[There was a paragraph here that does not apply in this electronic edition.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->It was frequently the author&#146;s practice, in the case of discourses given in a language other than Bengali, to personally review the Bengali translation and to make revisions and additions. Wherever this appeared to have been done, the editors have taken the Bengali version as the basis for the English translation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->With all articles noted below as &ldquo;retr.&rdquo; (retranslated), the retranslation was done taking all possible material from existing translations.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->Within each of the four parts of Discourses on Tantra, the articles are in chronological order.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->This Second Edition represents little change from the First Edition. The only substantial difference will be found in the chapter &ldquo;Tantra in Bengal&rdquo;, which was and still is a compilation of excerpts from two discourses on the history of Bengal. For this edition, part of the previous selection of material from the first of those discourses has been replaced with what the editors felt to be still more pertinent material. A few other articles underwent minor corrections of wording (in the case of translations), or touching up of editorial remarks, or correction of typos: &ldquo;The Devotee and the Lord&rdquo;, &ldquo;Ta&#x301;raka Brahma&rdquo;, &ldquo;Mantra Caetanya&rdquo;, &ldquo;Stages of Sama&#x301;dhi&rdquo; (which now conforms with the version in its source book, A&#x301;nanda Vacana&#x301;mrtam 23), &ldquo;The Acoustic Roots of the Indo-Aryan Alphabet&rdquo; and &ldquo;Tantra and Indo-Aryan Civilization&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="2..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Each and every stage of Macrocosmic expression &ndash; crude, subtle or causal &ndash; shines with divine joy. Every atom of the universe is moving in that divine flow, in that rhythmic dance. It is as if this entire universe is the stage for the divine dance of Purus&#x301;ottama. The divine dance, with Purus&#x301;ottama as its nucleus, is the blissful flow of joyful creation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->When Prakrti loses Her balance, different evolutionary changes begin. Prakrti and Her principles are given different names at different stages of evolutionary change in the flow of creation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->At the first stage, when there is no imbalance in the triangle of forces, Prakrti is called Kaos&#x301;ikii Shakti (Shiva&#x301;nii Shakti). She is given this name because she is responsible for the creation of the kos&#x301;as [layers of mind]. In that supreme stage Kaos&#x301;ikii remains unmanifested, remains as the primordial cause of all subsequent manifestations.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The second stage of Prakrti occurs when the triangle of forces loses its equilibrium. This is the stage at which Prakrti is first expressed as a straight line emerging from one of the vertices of the unbalanced triangle. It is called the Bhaeravii or intermediate stage. At this stage of expression there is no wave, and hence creation remains beyond the scope of perception. It is only when na&#x301;da [flow without curvature] is converted into kala&#x301; [flow with curvature] that creation comes within the scope of perception.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->When Bhaeravii Shakti attains the form of kala&#x301; She is called Bhava&#x301;nii Shakti, and thus begins Prakrti&#146;s third stage of expression. Bhava&#x301;nii Shakti is active in air, light, vital energy and numerous other entities, and is responsible for maintaining the coordinating link between the crude and the subtle.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->In intuitional practice this process is reversed: devotees elevate themselves from Bhava&#x301;nii Shakti to Bhaeravii Shakti, from Bhaeravii Shakti to Kaos&#x301;ikii Shakti, and finally attain oneness with the Supreme Entity. Those who pursue this path of divine adoration are called devotees. Whom do devotees ideate on? Certainly on Purus&#x301;ottama. Those who accept matter as their object of ideation can never attain Purus&#x301;ottama, but will invariably degenerate towards the staticity of Bhava&#x301;nii Shakti. Their entire being will ultimately be converted into inert matter. To ideate on Purus&#x301;ottama means to transform Bhava&#x301;nii into Bhaeravii and Bhaeravii into Kaos&#x301;ikii, thereby establishing oneness between the devotee and the Lord. In the process of transforming crude waves into subtle waves, devotees become one with their final goal. If one&#146;s movement is towards the crude, one&#146;s psycho-physical waves will become cruder and cruder. But if one&#146;s movement is towards the Supreme, if Bhava&#x301;nii Shakti is transformed into Bhaeravii Shakti, then one&#146;s waves will gradually straighten. The subtle waves of effulgence will also become straight. Thus a devotee&#146;s movement towards the Supreme One is an endeavour to transform crude energy into subtle energy. To transform Bhava&#x301;nii Shakti into Bhaeravii Shakti both shraddha&#x301; [implicit veneration for one&#146;s goal] and viirya [stamina] are important. Without regular spiritual practice this transformation is impossible.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->For a devotee, action is indispensable. Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; itself is a type of action. If one sits idle like a piece of inert matter, sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is impossible; the conversion of crude into subtle will never occur. The relationship between devotees and their Lord is strengthened through action. At this point a question may arise: on the path of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; who is greater &ndash; a bhakta [devotee] or a karmii [person of action]? The answer is simple and straightforward. For bhaktas all actions are a part of their psycho-spiritual practice, whereas for karmiis actions are merely seen as actions. Those people whose actions are indistinguishable from devotion are true devotees. Thus in the process of conversion of Bhava&#x301;nii Shakti into Bhaeravii Shakti, devotion plays a greater role than so-called action.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->What is the source of inspiration of the individual&#146;s efforts to convert crude energy into subtle energy? In this case the Cognitive Faculty is the source of inspiration. Bhaeravii Shakti is prevented from being converted into Bhava&#x301;nii Shakti with the help of the Cognitive Faculty, and with the help of the Cognitive Faculty Bhaeravii Shakti is merged in the cognitive flow.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->In the struggle to transform Bhaeravii Shakti into Kaos&#x301;ikii Shakti, Citishakti [Cognitive Force] plays a dominant role, because Bhaeravii Shakti is the second stage of Citishakti in the flow of creation. The Cognitive Force manifests itself as Bhaeravii Shakti to expedite the evolution of mind. The will to evolve is primarily dependent on the active role of Bhaeravii Shakti. In fact Bhaeravii Shakti is one&#146;s real &ldquo;I&rdquo;. It is with Her help that one must carry on one&#146;s sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; to attain Citishakti. It is just like worshipping the Ganges with the water of the Ganges.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Suppose a certain student studies abroad with his father&#146;s financial assistance. If he saves a little money every month and buys his father one of his favourite objects, his father will certainly feel happy. The pursuit of dharma is a similar process. One attains Parama Purus&#x301;a with the proper application of devotion, knowledge and action, which are the faculties He has chosen to bestow on spiritual aspirants.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Exactly the reverse occurs in the case of materialists who are puffed up with vanity: their Bhaeravii Shakti is gradually converted into Bhava&#x301;nii Shakti. Only devotees can expand Bhaeravii Shakti because only they cherish the desire for supreme union with the Cognitive Faculty. They do not ask the Supreme Being for wealth, opulence, fame or children, but pray, &ldquo;O Lord, please manifest Yourself fully in me. Make me Yours, O Lord.&rdquo; They continue to pray like this until they merge in the Supreme.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->They continue their efforts to attain the Supreme with the physical and psychic strength already bestowed upon them by the Supreme Entity. To ask for extra power without first utilizing the power already given them would be to show disrespect to Parama Purus&#x301;a. Only after all their power has been totally exhausted may they ask Parama Purus&#x301;a for anything. If He so desires, Parama Purus&#x301;a may grant that request through some third entity. While utilizing one&#146;s energy one should pray to Parama Purus&#x301;a, &ldquo;O Lord, I am working with the strength given by You. Let me not make the mistake of taking it to be my own power. Let me not forget You, O Lord.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Devotees will have to straighten the waves of Bhava&#x301;nii Shakti. The more the waves are straightened, the more Bhava&#x301;nii will be transformed into Bhaeravii Shakti. This straightening of the waves is the first stage of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. As long as sa&#x301;dhakas remain within the scope of Bhava&#x301;nii Shakti they observe that all finite entities of the universe are separate from one another. But when they enter the bounds of Bhaeravii Shakti after straightening the waves of Bhava&#x301;nii Shakti, they discover that all those previous differentiations have vanished into nothingness. The more the influence of Bhava&#x301;nii Shakti, the greater the feeling of differentiation; and the more the influence of Bhaeravii Shakti, the greater the feeling of unity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Many people think that social service alone is the best process of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, but they are mistaken. Through intuitional practice a sa&#x301;dhaka succeeds in elevating Bhaeravii and Bhava&#x301;nii Shaktis in individual life. A person who develops the cognitive faculty in this way will spontaneously do social service. Service is the way and the life of such a spiritual aspirant. A balance between one&#146;s individual dharma and social dharma will thus be established.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->When one&#146;s cognitive faculty becomes so subtle that one sees Brahma in all manifested entities, one can play a proper role in the practical world. Only at this stage does one realize that no one in this universe is inferior, for all are the children of the same Supreme Father and Supreme Mother. Brothers and sisters belonging to the same family cannot belong to separate castes. So those who support casteism are atheists. Those who want to perpetuate economic disparities are also atheists. No parents could sincerely desire one of their children to become fabulously rich and roll in opulence, while another slowly starves to death.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Human beings should develop themselves as individuals by expanding their dormant cognitive faculties through intuitional practice, and should develop their socio-economic life by eradicating the vested interests in the socio-economic sphere. Those who have rendered service to society and have either become government ministers or been otherwise rewarded with power and prestige, but have failed to practise sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; in their personal lives, generally degenerate later.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->What happens before Bhava&#x301;nii Shakti is metamorphosed into Bhaeravii Shakti? Bhava&#x301;nii Shakti emanates from Purus&#x301;a in so many waves. It is the variation in these waves which causes the differences among the many objects of the universe. Bhava&#x301;nii, Bhaeravii and Kaos&#x301;ikii Shaktis are created according to the way the three principles act on the Cognitive Faculty. When major changes occur in Bhava&#x301;nii Shakti, ether, air, fire, water and other crude objects can be perceived. These entities acquire different forms due to the differences in the waves created by the three principles. Thus we observe the same Purus&#x301;a manifested in different ways.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->It is due to a particular vibration of Bhava&#x301;nii Shakti that we perceive Purus&#x301;a as a piece of iron, and due to another vibration that we perceive Purus&#x301;a as a piece of gold. Had there been no differences among the wavelengths of Bhava&#x301;nii Shakti, there would have been no differences among the manifested objects. When spiritual aspirants remain within the periphery of Bhava&#x301;nii Shakti and observe the differences among objects, they realize the Supreme Singularity behind the diversity of expression.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->All objects are the varying forms of Purus&#x301;a.

<a name="2..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->So in the first stage of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, as a result of the constant superimposition of Cosmic ideation, Bhava&#x301;nii Shakti is changed into Bhaeravii Shakti. Then all the objects of the world are seen as expressions of Brahma. This realization is not brought about by the study of books. Book knowledge is only perceptional knowledge; it cannot take one beyond the boundary of perception. If people study constantly without practising sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, psycho-physical parallelism will make them vain and egotistical.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="2..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->The constant churning of the ocean of knowledge produces butter and buttermilk. The spiritual aspirants eat the butter; the pandits remain satisfied with the buttermilk. The goal of a sa&#x301;dhaka is not to become a bookworm, but to become a devotee.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->Remember that until one becomes one with the Cognitive Faculty, one will have to continue to act. Through karma sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; [the yoga of action] one advances to the second stage of progress, realizing that everything is Brahma. The outlook of differentiation is a defective outlook.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->In the third stage the question of differentiation does not even arise: the difference between the seer and the &ldquo;seeable&rdquo; is completely obliterated. The doer, the deed and the witnessing entity merge in the same Consciousness. All that remains is one undifferentiated Supreme Entity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->The Cosmic force that is active in the psychic sphere of microcosms is Bhaeravii Shakti. As Bhaeravii is the force which starts moving from a vertex of the unbalanced supreme triangle, one will have to concentrate one&#146;s mind on a particular point in the process of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. Thus in a&#x301;sana shuddhi, Bhaeravii Shakti is concentrated at a nuclear point, and subsequently transformed into Kaos&#x301;ikii Shakti. When that transformation occurs, the unit mind gradually dissolves into the Cosmic Mind. The three principles of Prakrti remain perfectly balanced in Kaos&#x301;ikii Shakti, and thus lie unexpressed.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->Devotees reach Kaos&#x301;ikii Shakti with the help of Bhava&#x301;nii and Bhaeravii Shaktis. Hence devotees must be Sha&#x301;ktas, always ready to fight against the hostile forces which thwart spiritual progress. They must not encourage timidity or cowardice. If their minds are directed towards Bhava&#x301;nii Shakti their Bhaeravii Shakti will become crudified. Hence sa&#x301;dhakas must carry on a relentless fight against all crudifying forces. For this reason they must also be viira&#x301;ca&#x301;riis.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.2.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#2.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> They must ideate constantly on Parama Purus&#x301;a, and gradually transform Bhaeravii Shakti into Kaos&#x301;ikii Shakti. But one should remember that Kaos&#x301;ikii Shakti is not one&#146;s final goal. Even after merging one&#146;s identity into Kaos&#x301;ikii Shakti it can still be the cause of bondage and subsequent rebirth.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->Of all the bondages, the bondage of [Bhava&#x301;nii] is most strongly felt, but [Bhava&#x301;nii] Herself is not the original entity. While utilizing mundane objects, one should always ideate on the Cognitive Faculty working behind this myriad world of forms and colours. The regressive movement that the mind makes when ideating on matter is prevented by this Cosmic ideation or Brahmacarya sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->One who ideates on the Supreme Entity while engaged in individual and collective sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; establishes a happy correlation between Bhaeravii Shakti and one&#146;s cognitive faculty. Such a person will never degenerate, even though his or her cherished supreme goal may not be fully realized. The main factor is the clear awareness of one&#146;s goal. Your own excellence depends on the excellence of your goal. To build a bridge over the Ganges is not the goal in itself; the actual goal is to connect north Bihar to south Bihar. Of course, that goal is achieved by building the bridge.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->The attainment of Brahma signifies the victory of one&#146;s ideology; first the victory of Bhaeravii Shakti and then the victory of Kaos&#x301;ikii Shakti. Or put in another way, first the defeat of Bhava&#x301;nii Shakti, then the defeat of Bhaeravii and Kaos&#x301;ikii Shaktis at the hands of Purus&#x301;a. When one becomes the master of Bhava&#x301;nii, Bhaeravii and Kaos&#x301;ikii Shaktis, one attains enormous power to subdue the wicked forces and protect the forces of righteousness in the external world.<!-- /block --></p>

This process of bringing these three shaktis within one&#146;s control is called sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;samara [the battle of intuitional practice]. This battle should end in one of two ways: in victory or in death. One should never undergo the ignominy of defeat. If one dies while seeking the Supreme, one will surely attain the Supreme after death. One who is totally absorbed in ideation on the Supreme becomes one with the Supreme at the time of death. This is certainly true in the case of devotees. The duality between the one who serves and the entity served ceases to exist. Ultimately the one who serves, the entity who is served, and the action of serving become fused into one. If one&#146;s goal is right, one is sure to attain the supreme stance. And one who attains the supreme stance will never make the mistake of differentiating between high and low, literate and illiterate, touchable and untouchable.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="3..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Consciousness in the psycho-physical unit structures gets manifested in the process of pratisain&#x32D;cara when Purus&#x301;ottama by His ota yoga associatively reflects on the unit psychic plate. It is through this process, pratisain&#x32D;cara, that the Ever-Merciful elevates each creation of His by the force of Vidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301;. As already discussed, the physical and psychic clash and the attraction of the Great cause psychic dilation, and ultimately the unit psychic body can attain its final liberation or mukti by its spiritual sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. Different unit minds exist at different levels and experience varying degrees of His love and proximity depending upon their progress in the process of pratisain&#x32D;cara. The auspicious day with infinite a&#x301;nanda descends, and all the bondages of Prakrti shatter down when Brahmatva  is attained.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Such individuals set the ideal for humanity and, in turn, humanity starts paying homage to them. Such elevated beings can and should only be called Maha&#x301;purus&#x301;a, meaning thereby elevated psychic beings. Unto their holy feet, one can offer the flowers of devotion and aspiration, but they desire no crude earthly flowers and offerings.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The advent of Maha&#x301;purus&#x301;a is misinterpreted as incarnation. Incarnation is an illogical hypothesis. The whole universe being created out of Him and by Him is His incarnation. The term avata&#x301;ra means a &ldquo;derivation&rdquo;, and the application of this term to individual units who are far advanced in the process of pratisain&#x32D;cara is a misleading misnomer. It is illogical to consider that the Macrocosm metamorphosed Himself directly into some unit structure, mostly as a human being. Human beings are the most evolved individual units as a class in His creation, and every stage of the elevated psychic Maha&#x301;purus&#x301;a is the result of sain&#x32D;cara and then pratisain&#x32D;cara. It is a gradual elevation and not an abrupt descent or occurrence.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Logically speaking, therefore, it will be correct to designate any unit consciousness as incarnation of God or to say that the Messenger of God traverses the path of sain&#x32D;cara, goes through a process of evolution and importance, and through psychic dilation in the process of pratisain&#x32D;cara reaches different stages of elevation. The incarnation theory, or avata&#x301;rava&#x301;da, however, hypothesizes that the incarnated being is the direct descent of the Almighty, the rest of His creation remaining unexplained as to its source of origin.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The word avata&#x301;ra [derives from ava &ndash; tr, which means] &ldquo;descend&rdquo;, &ldquo;derive&rdquo; or &ldquo;degenerate&rdquo;. The incarnated being, according to this dogma of degeneration of Purus&#x301;ottama, cannot have an equal status with Purus&#x301;ottama. When the psychic status of a created being assumes sameness with the Cosmic Entity, the unit psychic entity actually merges into the Cosmic Mind leaving no dualism. Hence how can any equal status with Purus&#x301;ottama be imagined existing as a separate entity in any stage within Brahma Cakra (the collective name of sain&#x32D;cara and pratisain&#x32D;cara)? The whole theory of incarnation or avata&#x301;rava&#x301;da is, therefore, not convincing and rational for an intellectual analysis.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Behind the superstitious belief of avata&#x301;rava&#x301;da lies one more social current created by a class of vested interests. Inquisitiveness and reasoning is a natural impulse in human beings. Due to certain pressing circumstances or intellectual renaissance there was a reaction against the illogical faiths and superstitions prevalent in society. These superstitions provided a strong basis for exploitation of society by intellectual parasites who had learnt to live on the blood and labour of others. To maintain their domination through a system of superstitious belief, these parasites invented means to curb this growth of reaction and intellectual rationalism and presented to the mass a sentimental appeal. Any command, rational or irrational, was enforced on society with so-called divine force by enunciation of the incarnation theory. Corruption was perpetrated in the name of God and all those raising their heads against such commands or preachings were called reactionaries, atheists, and curbed drastically. &ldquo;Give the dog a bad name and hang it,&rdquo; was their motto. They went to the extent of manipulating, polluting and misinterpreting even the precious writings of many great philosophers whose work had been respected as religious treatises from ancient times &ndash; all with an ulterior motive, to get their interests served.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="3..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->In Brahma Cakra there is no uniformity of flow. The speed of the sentient force is greater than that of the mutative, and the mutative has more speed than the static. Thus in the beginning of sain&#x32D;cara the speed is greater. Similarly, after elevation, under the influence of the sentient force or reaching sa&#x301;ma&#x301;nya deha (a stage beyond the hiran&#x301;maya kos&#x301;a where the unit mind experiences only the sentient force), the speed is greater. The speed of the unit mind far exceeds the normal flow in the Cosmos, and it gets accelerated if the unit mind as a result of spiritual practice tends itself towards the Nucleus Consciousness.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Since the beginning of creation humans have been aspiring for this merger with the Nucleus Consciousness. The non-uniformity of speed changes the movement of the unit mind to an elliptical force, and the motion changes to oval from circular. They get merged in Purus&#x301;ottama who aspire for Him as the ultimate destiny, but those who aim at moks&#x301;a, where sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is the complete surrender of self into That (Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma, the Objectless Consciousness), get out of this Brahma Cakra by a tangential touch. At this point of tangential touch is the abode of Ta&#x301;raka Brahma (who resides within the scope of both Nirgun&#x301;a and Sagun&#x301;a Brahma). Ta&#x301;raka Brahma is a concept of Tantra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->In Tantra the whole creation is known as sambhu&#x301;ti. When Ta&#x301;raka Brahma by His own will takes the help of the five fundamental factors (the pain&#x32D;ca bhu&#x301;tas), His physical entity comes within the scope of Sagun&#x301;a Brahma, otherwise He is Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma. When Ta&#x301;raka Brahma takes the assistance of the five fundamental factors, according to Tantra it is called His Maha&#x301;sambhu&#x301;ti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->In Tantra sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; or in Ananda Marga sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; one whose goal is Purus&#x301;ottama merges in Sagun&#x301;a Brahma, and one who aims at Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma becomes surrendered into the Objectless Entity. It is only in Tantra that the sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; of Ta&#x301;raka Brahma has been specially defined distinct from the sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; of Nirgun&#x301;a and Sagun&#x301;a and has its own peculiarity. Theoretically speaking, Sagun&#x301;a Brahma has infinite sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras, and so for an infinite time to come Sagun&#x301;a Brahma will continue to enjoy the fruits of Its own past actions. Nirgun&#x301;a is the Objectless Entity with no action or derivation, but Ta&#x301;raka Brahma is the middle point and can fulfil the function of both. He guides, loves and favours His affectionate sons and daughters. His children say that He cannot live without loving them and address Him, &ldquo;O our great Father, our affectionate Mother, our All, we remember Thee, we adore Thee. O Witnessing Entity, we offer our homage to Thee, Thou art the only rescue in this crude worldly ocean, so to Thee we surrender ourselves.&rdquo; This complete surrender is the summum bonum of all spiritual sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, which only can lead to Him from where decline is not even imaginable. Really blessed is one who has attained this complete surrender unto Him, like the piece of salt which went to measure the depth of the ocean &ndash; but a momentous divine jerk and an attraction occurred and the bit of salt was lost, no one knows where.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="4..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->In the previous chapters, it has been clearly explained that the Transcendent Entity is one Infinite and Its immanent principles are the sentient, the mutative and the static. By their very nature these forces are belligerent. Their direction is haphazard, forming infinite figures with innumerable sides. Prakrti here is said to be anucchu&#x301;nya&#x301;, and Brahma here is objectless, because there is no question of subjectivation (feeling of Doer &ldquo;I&rdquo;) or objectivation (feeling of done &ldquo;I&rdquo;), and therefore Brahma is called nirgun&#x301;a, &ldquo;beyond all the attributes&rdquo; of Prakrti. In common language it is said that Prakrti has not been able to get Brahma influenced or metamorphosed. Here, therefore, there is not even the seed of creation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->If more than two forces are acting at a place the figure of forces tends to become triangular. These belligerent forces, therefore, make a triangle of forces. In the initial stage, there is balance in the triangular figure. The hectagon, septagon and other multi-sided figures have been transformed into triangles of forces, but no resultant is formed because of proper adjustment of the three types of forces. In this state of equilibrium, the triple qualities of Prakrti exist, but in a balanced state. This state, however, differs from the previous one not only in the fact that a triangle of forces has been formed, but also in the fact that the sentient, the mutative and the static forces are clearly distinguishable. In the previous stage the forces had no clear identity; they were flowing without any feelings. But in this triangular stage there is a constant exchange of identities amongst the three fundamental principles (forces). This mutual exchange or transformation is called svaru&#x301;pa parin&#x301;a&#x301;ma. The conversion involves no bondage, and though the sentient is penetrating into the mutative, the mutative into the static and so on, there is a perfect balance here. The balanced Prakrti is addressed simply as Prakrti (without any adjective).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Purus&#x301;a is the fundamental entity at every stage. When He gets encircled by the triangle of forces (sentient, mutative and static), though no resultant force has formed, there is a theoretical difference between the Purus&#x301;abha&#x301;va in the first stage when Prakrti was anucchu&#x301;nya&#x301;, and the Purus&#x301;abha&#x301;va in the second stage when Prakrti has shaped Herself into a triangle of forces. In the later stage not only is Purus&#x301;a in a theoretical bondage of the three principles, but also there is a chance of His being expressed. Purus&#x301;a has not yet metamorphosed, due to equilibrium of the triangle of forces, but the chance of metamorphosis is imminent, so in spite of the fact that Purus&#x301;a here is unaffected, there is a theoretical speciality in Purus&#x301;a at this stage. This Purus&#x301;abha&#x301;va is called Shiva, and Prakrti, Shiva&#x301;nii or Kaos&#x301;ikii. Prakrti is called Kaos&#x301;ikii because She is the cause of origin of different kos&#x301;as which are formed later on in the process of evolution.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The difference between Shiva and Shiva&#x301;nii here is merely theoretical because no actual manifestation has occurred. Practical difference between Purus&#x301;a and Prakrti starts arising the moment a resultant of forces is formed. Imbalance or lack of equilibrium in the three belligerent forces causes this resultant, and metamorphosis of Purus&#x301;a starts due to activation by this Prakrti. The point at which the resultant force bursts out is known as biija &ndash; in Tantra, it is called ka&#x301;mabiija. Here lies the innate desire of creation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Shiva Shakti vibha&#x301;gena, ja&#x301;yate srs&#x301;t&#x301;i kalpana&#x301;, that is, &ldquo;Shiva, the Transcendental Entity encircled in the triangle of forces, and Shakti, or Prakrti, on being acted and reacted within themselves, are the cause of the divine desire of creation.&rdquo; This point (ka&#x301;mabiija) is static and is dominated by Avidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301; and rests within its scope of activity. This is the point wherein lies the Cosmic desire. It, therefore, can also be termed iccha&#x301;biija, or &ldquo;seed of desire&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->The next stage after this point is the expression of desire or the expression of the resultant force, which must be in a straight line (jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nashakti na&#x301;da) because every force expresses itself by a direction. Philosophically speaking, even though the point is dominated by the static force, further expression is due to the sentient force. Prakrti has a tremendous force but is mainly sentient at this stage, even though the mutative is well active within it. At this stage the flow of expression must, therefore, be in a straight line, because the sentient-dominated force itself must be a straight line.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Prakrti by nature merges Herself in Purus&#x301;abha&#x301;va regularly but by degrees. Hence the flow changes and the force of expression gradually becomes less and less. There is also a never-ending clash amongst the belligerent forces of Prakrti, due to which internal friction increases. Thus due to gradual merger of Prakrti and growing internal friction (known as gun&#x301;aks&#x301;obha in Tantra) within Prakrti, the flow ceases to be in a straight line, tends to take up curvature and attains a wavelength. The first curvature thus formed is termed kala&#x301; (kriya&#x301; shakti). Prakrti is active from ka&#x301;mabiija to the kala&#x301; and is called Bhaeravii in the na&#x301;da stage, and Purus&#x301;a is termed Bhaerava.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->The conquest of the mutative over the sentient and the gradual movement towards domination (second occasion) by the static force results in curvatures following the preceding curvature. Kala&#x301; is followed by further formation of curvatures one after another, but each succeeding curve is not necessarily of the same wavelength as the preceding one. In fact, the difference goes on increasing as the wavelength continues to decrease. This sequence of curvatures is known as sadrsha parin&#x301;a&#x301;ma. Here the static-dominated mutative Prakrti is responsible for the expression of the universe. The universe gets created. Prakrti responsible for this creation or metamorphosis is known as Bhava&#x301;nii; She is the energy of evolution. The metamorphosed Purus&#x301;abha&#x301;va under the influence of Bhava&#x301;nii is called Bhava. In Sanskrit bhava means &ldquo;to become&rdquo;. Here Purus&#x301;a has become the universe of creation and therefore Purus&#x301;a is called Bhava. The practical difference between Bhava and Bhava&#x301;nii is the maximum, whereas the difference between Bhaerava and Bhaeravii was tending from the theoretical to the practical aspect.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->In the first chapter, on &ldquo;Sain&#x32D;cara and Pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;h&rdquo;, it was pointed out that the whole universe is the thought-projection of the Cosmic Mind, or Macrocosm. The projection of Macrocosm towards expression is a singular positive approach by which the Cosmos appears to have taken the shape of this universe. In this path of evolutionary expression, the human physique gets its existence at a later stage of the formation of the curvatures. The complexity of the physical curvature goes on increasing, yet it is very near the point of its descent. The mental body is much more subtle and can by sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, or spiritual practice, trespass and counteract the force of Avidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301; and proceed forth to come under the influence of Vidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301;, the force of Cosmic attraction. Mental liberation, or mukti, is possible this way.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Non-qualified liberation, or moks&#x301;a, is, however, only possible if the mental body, starting from the crudest mental subjectivity of the physical body, can, by any force, retrace against the singular positive force emanating due to the thought-projection of the Macrocosm. This force against the singular positive force must be a negative one. Hence the path of non-qualified spiritual practice which can reach final moks&#x301;a is always the path of negativity. The theoretical negative force with its fundamental negativity, which tends towards the final merger into Purus&#x301;a for attaining moks&#x301;a, is called kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii &ndash; the &ldquo;coiled serpentine&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Since kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii is the negative force of the unit body, it is different for each individual. As the sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is more or less for a psycho-physical liberation in the initial stage, its starting-point must be in the crudest manifestation. It must reside in that portion of the physical body from which the crudest matter (ks&#x301;ititattva) of the body is controlled. The starting-point of the kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii, therefore, is in the mu&#x301;la&#x301;dha&#x301;ra. It is fundamentally negative in character, and its starting-point is the negative ka&#x301;mabiija of the living being, just as the point from which the positive resultant force of Prakrti got expression is the ka&#x301;mabiija, or iccha&#x301;biija, of the Cosmic Being.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->The arena in which the kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii resides is known as ka&#x301;ma-piitha. The starting-point of the fundamental positivity, that is, the ka&#x301;mabiija of the Cosmic Being, is on the back of Shambhu&#x301;liun&#x32D;ga, and that of negativity on the back of Svayambhu&#x301;liun&#x32D;ga. Within the self of the yoga sa&#x301;dhaka, or one who practises the scientific method of spiritual approach with the help of this kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii, the force of fundamental negativity fights out and aggressively rises up against the force of Avidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301; and thereby gets domination over the flow of fundamental positivity. This path of non-compromising aggressive spirituality is the only way to ultimate oneness with Infinite Consciousness.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="5..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Purport: In time as the result of internal clashes the flow of forces betrays some curvatures, and the density of the Purus&#x301;abha&#x301;va [stance of Consciousness] also goes on decreasing. In this very condition develops the first kala&#x301; [curvature]. The second kala&#x301; is similar (not identical) to the first, and the third is similar to the second, and so on. So goes the kala&#x301; prava&#x301;ha [sequential or phasic flow]. This sequential evolution of kala&#x301;s is called  sadrsha parin&#x301;a&#x301;ma [homogenesis, or similitude]. In these homogenetic waves are evolved the mental and physical worlds. It is due to this (homoform) curvilinear evolution that we find that the child of a human is a human and tree begets tree. The kala&#x301;s are similar but not identical, and so although the difference between two successive kala&#x301;s is not clearly perceivable, the differences of kala&#x301;s having distant mutual relations are clearly understandable. Although the physical changes of one whom we see every day are not understandable, we can certainly make out the difference if we see a child of five, after twenty years, as a youth of twenty-five. Although human begets human, there will be a gulf of difference between a human of a million years ago and a human of today. In fact the creatress of the manifest world is this sequential force, which is called Bhava&#x301;nii shakti and whose witnessing Purus&#x301;a is Bhava.

<a name="6..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->What is the meaning of Maha&#x301;sambhu&#x301;ti? To acquire knowledge about Maha&#x301;sambhu&#x301;ti, you must first understand sambhu&#x301;ti and vina&#x301;sha. The word sambhu&#x301;ti is derived as: prefix sam &ndash; root verb bhu&#x301; + suffix ktin, which combine to mean literally, &ldquo;proper development, proper origin&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->What is proper development or origin? When something is created it is called sambhu&#x301;ti. But when people create something new out of some existing fundamental stuff, it is not called sambhu&#x301;ti. (There are certain fundamental elements which human beings cannot create, but out of which they can create various objects. These objects are called elements, and all are included in sambhu&#x301;ti.) Actually, sambhu&#x301;ti is a special creation of Parama Purus&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->What do we mean by vina&#x301;sha? Vina&#x301;sha is derived as: vi &ndash; nash + ghain&#x32D;. Usually we come across three such words: na&#x301;sha, vina&#x301;sha and pran&#x301;a&#x301;sha. What we call &ldquo;destruction&rdquo; in ordinary language is called na&#x301;sha. When an object is transformed and cannot be brought back to its original form it is called vina&#x301;sha. For example, when a five-year-old boy grows into a twenty-five-year-old man it signifies a major change. Where has the growing body of the five-year-old gone? It has been annihilated. When an object returns to its original source after being annihilated, it is called pran&#x301;a&#x301;sha. Pran&#x301;a&#x301;sha signifies destruction also, but of a different nature. For example, when you prepare puri [unleavened bread puffed by deep frying] out of wheat flour and then transform it back into wheat flour, this is pran&#x301;a&#x301;sha.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Let us take another example. Sugar is made from cane-juice. If the sugar is transformed back into cane-juice, that will be pran&#x301;a&#x301;sha. In brief, sambhu&#x301;ti means &ldquo;an original creation&rdquo;, and vina&#x301;sha is the total destruction of an object which cannot be transformed back to its original source.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->The fundamental stuff of the universe has emerged from Parama Purus&#x301;a; hence all objects, big and small, are the sambhu&#x301;tis of Parama Purus&#x301;a. This sambhu&#x301;ti or creation is divided into various worlds: physical, plant, animal and human. Inanimate and animate beings are divided into various branches and sub-branches, which are also the creations of Parama Purus&#x301;a. In ordinary language they can also be called avata&#x301;ra. When Parama Purus&#x301;a is manifested in some physical object, that physical object is called the avata&#x301;ra of Parama Purus&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->The word avata&#x301;ra is derived as: ava &ndash; tr + ghain&#x32D;. How diversified is the creation of Parama Purus&#x301;a! What striking differences there are among objects! Even in the plant world some plants are quite developed, while others are totally undeveloped. In the living world the protozoic body is undeveloped, but the metazoic body is developed. There is tremendous complexity within the flow of evolution of living beings. The undeveloped creatures of the living world are called jiivakot&#x301;i, and those which are highly developed are called Iishvarakot&#x301;i. The entire gamut of evolution from protozoic cells up to human beings are called jiivakot&#x301;is. These jiivakot&#x301;is [living beings] evolve through psychic and social clash. For example, those people who are dull and unintelligent today are sure to develop one day in the gradual process of evolution. When they become highly intelligent people, their physical capacity  will also increase. Through intensive self-culture, a jiivakot&#x301;i can achieve a lot. Thus one should not worry; those who have taken the shelter of Parama Purus&#x301;a will certainly merge in Him.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Like jiivakot&#x301;is, the other branches and sub-branches of creation have originated from Parama Purus&#x301;a. You are not the actual owner of your physical and intellectual strength and spiritual power all these things have come from Parama Purus&#x301;a. All these powers have their limits, but Parama Purus&#x301;a is the source of all power.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->In a jiivakot&#x301;i, strength can develop only to a certain degree, for the capacity of development of living beings is limited  this is why they are called jiivakot&#x301;is. Suppose a certain man is trying to increase his physical strength through physical exercise. His strength can increase only to a certain degree. The physical strength of human beings is such that it cannot increase beyond a certain point. In exactly the same way, a certain person may develop the power of memory; but this development can take place only up to a certain age. Once that age is reached, there can be no further improvement. An ordinary human being can never become omniscient.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->And what does Iishvarakot&#x301;i mean? In Iishvarakot&#x301;i there is a greater manifestation of divinity. A jiivakot&#x301;i by virtue of sincere and ardent spiritual practice can elevate itself to Iishvarakot&#x301;i. Both jiivakot&#x301;i and Iishvarakot&#x301;i are creations of Parama Purus&#x301;a. Thus in the gradual process of evolution they will become one with Brahma one day. In the Vedas it has been said:<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="6..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Es&#x301;o ha deva pradisho&#146;nu sarva&#x301;. Each direction is a creation of Parama Purus&#x301;a. He exists in all four directions. There are considerable differences in recommendations as to which way one should face while sitting in meditation or worship. Some say east, some say west; others advise north. Superstitious people consider the south to be inauspicious, as the south is supposed to be death&#146;s door. But the rs&#x301;i [sage] says that all the pradisha [cardinal points]  north, south, east and west  and all the anudisha [secondary points]  northeast, northwest, southeast, southwest, above and below  are the sambhu&#x301;tis of Parama Purus&#x301;a.

<a name="6..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Pu&#x301;rvohaja&#x301;tah. Those objects which existed in the distant past were also His creation. For instance, this planet earth was created after dissociation from the sun about 8,000 million years ago. At that time this earth was only a gaseous substance, but that too was a creation of Parama Purus&#x301;a. Subsequently that gas cooled and gradually solidified to form the earth. This metamorphosis took place around 2,230 million years ago, long before the advent of human beings. Naturally there was no question of anyone ascribing any name to it.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="6..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->The totality of all the sambhu&#x301;tis is this universe. All the entities from the mighty sun to the tiny ant are a part of this universe. All the celestial bodies, living, dying or dead; all the nebulae, galaxies and the Milky Way; are members of the same universal family. A galaxy is vast, an ant is tiny, yet both have equal importance in maintaining the balance of the universe. If even an ant dies prematurely, that mishap may disturb the balance of the universe. Nothing in this universe is unimportant, not even a tiny ant. Suppose an ant moves an inch from the east to the west on a stone. If the balance of the stone is jeopardized by this change, this incident may be the cause of a major earthquake, because ants are also His sambhu&#x301;ti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Through excavation we have discovered many fossils of animals and plants. These discoveries prove that in ancient times various gigantic animals existed, most of which have become extinct. All that remains are the fossilized bones of their bodies. Various ages &ndash; [Archean], Mesozoic, Oligocene, Eocene, etc. &ndash; have come and gone. Each of these ages had its respective animals and plants, which became extinct in a subsequent age. Each age is a sambhu&#x301;ti; each animal, plant and geological layer is also a sambhu&#x301;ti. Nothing is unnecessary.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->About 1,700,000 years ago, towards the end of the Miocene Age and the early part of the Oligocene Age, the australopithecine came onto this earth. That animal is now extinct, but its successors, such as orangutans, chimpanzees, and gorillas, still exist. One branch of that group evolved into human beings. Hence the first ancestors of human beings should be called australopithecine and not &ldquo;Ka&#x301;shyapa&rdquo; or &ldquo;Bharadva&#x301;ja&rdquo; [names of early clan leaders]. The ancestors of human beings are monkeys, so monkeys are the relatives of human beings. All things that came on earth in the past were sambhu&#x301;tis of Parama Purus&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Sa u garbhe anta. Those beings which existed in the past are not the only sambhu&#x301;tis; those who will be born in the future will also be His sambhu&#x301;tis. Our ancestors used to say in ancient times, Aham&#x301; gaccha&#x301;mi [&ldquo;I&#146;m going&rdquo;]. Later on this was changed into Ahammi gacchata huim. Still later the sentence was changed into Man&#x32D;y ja&#x301;ha&#x301;ta&#x301; ha&#x301;n&#x32D;i. Finally it became Man&#x32D;y ja&#x301;ta&#x301; hun&#x32D; [in modern Hindi]. One thousand years from now the same sentence will be changed into Ma&#x301;i ja&#x301;n&#x32D;i. Thus you see, one sambhu&#x301;ti is dying, yielding its place to a new one.

Maha&#x301;sambhu&#x301;ti is the object of your ideation. There are certain entities which take a long time in undergoing internal and external change. For example, during the Cretaceous Age this earth was populated by gigantic animals which had immense bodies full of fat.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->The geography of this earth is constantly changing. Where the sea is surrounded by land on three sides it is called a bay, for instance, the Bay of Bengal. The water of a bay is not ruffled by the high waves of the sea. The carcasses of many animals and creatures used to wash into the waters of such bays and accumulate there. This process resulted in the creation of sargasso seas. The carcasses would form a layer on the surface of the water so thick that small animals could even walk on it. When this hard crust thickened enough, the result was the sargasso sea. Underneath was water, and on the surface people could live and move. As the dead bodies accumulated, the fatty portion of the carcasses was converted into mineral oil under climatic pressures and pressures created in the earth&#146;s surface. Thus by observing the geological structure of the earth, it is possible to determine the location of mineral oil. For example, the Assam valley, the Garo and Khasiya Hills, and the Himalayas, have large deposits of mineral oil, as do Rajasthan and Saurashtra. It takes a few tens of millions of years for animal fat to be converted into mineral oil.<!-- /block --></p>

No one can know your internal thought, but Parama Purus&#x301;a knows. Or suppose your boss has arrived. You give him a proper reception and verbally request him to stay three or four days. But internally you are thinking, &ldquo;The sooner this calamity is over, the better.&rdquo; Here you are maintaining a duality between the internality and the externality. Parama Purus&#x301;a certainly knows your dual role. He exists behind every object, in every existence. For each and every sambhu&#x301;ti He has created a witnessing counterpart. So it is not possible for you to keep anything secret  He has vigilant eyes everywhere. He is equally present in both animate and inanimate objects. We can say allegorically that He is associated with every object of creation through His five faces and His three eyes. The three eyes represent the past, present and future.<!-- /block --></p>

Please follow this path. Don&#146;t indulge in improper deeds, but follow the path of morality and pious deeds.&rdquo; Daks&#x301;in&#x301;eshvara guides people with sweet polite language.

<a name="7..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->In the balanced triangle of forces, in the pre-creation stage, when the unmanifested primordial Cognition has not yet come under the influence of the unmanifested primordial forces, that is, when the principles are purely in the subjective case and in the opposite direction there is nothing objective, that Cognitive Faculty in the unmanifested balanced triangle is called Gun&#x301;amaya. Parashiva is a philosophical equivalent term. When the three forces in a state of manifestation give rise to an objective case in the opposite direction, that antithesis in the form of the objective case is called Aparashiva. Parashiva is Gun&#x301;amaya, but Aparashiva, although Gun&#x301;amaya in the practical sphere, is actually not Gun&#x301;amaya in the theoretical sphere, because the alternation between manifestation and non-manifestation of the forces goes on constantly, simultaneously with the emanation, externalization, reflection and refraction from the points of Shambhu&#x301;liun&#x32D;ga and Svayambhu&#x301;liun&#x32D;ga.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The Siddha&#x301;nta&#x301;ca&#x301;ra, Va&#x301;ma&#x301;ca&#x301;ra and Kula&#x301;ca&#x301;ra of Shaeva Tantra [Shiva Tantra, Shaivite Tantra] are recognized by both the Hindu and Buddhist schools of Tantra. The Buddhist Vajraya&#x301;na, Mantraya&#x301;na, Tantraya&#x301;na and Ka&#x301;lacakraya&#x301;na sub-schools of Tantra recognize all of these a&#x301;ca&#x301;ras and follow them in actual practice. The purest part of Shaeva Tantra, which is beyond both Daks&#x301;in&#x301;a&#x301;ca&#x301;ra and Va&#x301;ma&#x301;ca&#x301;ra<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.7.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#7.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> and was formerly to be learned in s&#x301;a&#x301;mra&#x301;jya diiksa&#x301; [a kind of Tantric initiation] from a kaola guru [Tantric guru], is now included in Ra&#x301;ja&#x301;dhira&#x301;ja Yoga. Some of the subtler processes of Ananda Marga sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; bear a close relation to Ra&#x301;ja&#x301;dhira&#x301;ja. Mahars&#x301;i As&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301;vakra, while staying at Vakreshvar tiirtha [place of pilgrimage], introduced Ra&#x301;ja&#x301;dhira&#x301;ja and gave the first initiation in that school to the young Prince Alarka. In Hindu Tantra, Buddhist Tantra, and Ra&#x301;ja&#x301;dhira&#x301;ja Yoga, this concept of Parashiva in the unmanifested balanced triangle of forces has been recognized implicitly or explicitly. Naera&#x301;tma Devii of Ka&#x301;lacakraya&#x301;na and Shu&#x301;nya&#x301;tma Devii of Kaun&#x32D;ka&#x301;la-ma&#x301;linii Tantra are simply alternative names of Parashiva.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.7.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#7.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->In later years the school of Shaeva Tantra altogether lost its high-grade spiritual cult, and there remained only the more inconsequential of Va&#x301;ma&#x301;ca&#x301;ra Tantric practices such as dancing with a dead body and performing a type of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; with a skeleton. In a later period, lasting about 150 years, when the school of Terapantha&#x301; Jainism was to be found throughout all of northern India, Va&#x301;ma&#x301;ca&#x301;ra-oriented Shaeva Tantra had become practically extinct from all of India, particularly from Bengal. The school of Aghorpantha&#x301;, which is still to be found covertly practised in Bengal, is also a distorted form of Va&#x301;ma&#x301;ca&#x301;rii Shaeva Tantra. The original features of Shaeva Tantra, in the absence of a competent Tantric master and deserving Tantric disciples, have today become confused. Now it is like a labyrinth. Saora Tantra, Ga&#x301;n&#x301;apatya Tantra, and Shaeva Tantra do not have adequate scriptural literature, as Sha&#x301;kta Tantra and Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava Tantra have;<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.7.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#7.fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> Saora Tantra and Ga&#x301;n&#x301;apatya Tantra have almost no literature of their own. Once I ran across a few manuscripts of Shaeva Tantra written on palm leaves in red ink. The owners of the manuscripts could neither read them nor understand their meanings if they heard them, nor were they willing to transfer ownership of them to anyone else. But this much can be said, that their basic theme is Parashiva-oriented. It can also be said (through pure philosophical analysis and analysis of the cult which they prescribe) that their basic theme is the Parashiva Gun&#x301;amaya of Shaeva Tantra.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="8..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Before we try to understand what a mantra is, let us be clear about shabda [sound]. Everything in this manifest universe is vibrational. Creation is also vibrational. And the first and subtlest expression of the vibrational flow is shabda. As shabda is the first vibrational expression of Brahma, Shabda Brahma is the first expression of Ka&#x301;rya Brahma [Effect Brahma, Expressed Brahma]. The fundamental difference between Ka&#x301;rya Brahma and Ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a Brahma [Causal Brahma] is that all vika&#x301;sha, all expression, in Ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a Brahma is purely svagata (subjective) and svarasa&#x301;tmaka (blissful). There is no paragata (objective) or pararasa&#x301;tmaka (extroversial) pleasure therein. Being purely subjective and blissful, it has no vyain&#x32D;jana&#x301;tmaka bha&#x301;va, no exceptional quality. In other words, it is purely original and cannot [contain] any compound or mixture.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Prior to its practical emergence in the practical sphere, shabda was present in the realm of bha&#x301;va, or ideas. And the starting point of shabda in the world of ideation is called para&#x301;shakti. Para&#x301;shakti exists both in the unit<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.8.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#8.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> and in the [Cosmos]. Although potentially para&#x301;shakti has full possibilities of expression, due to lack of a medium it does not get expressed. It germinates into expression as soon as it finds a medium. And its vibrational expression is shabda. In other words, we hear sound within and without when there is a mutual clash in the medium due to the formation of troughs and crests of various waves. This then is shabda.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.8.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#8.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> <!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a Brahma [is represented] in Tantric scriptures by all the svaravarn&#x301;a [vowel] sounds taken together. When those sounds are converted into action, that is, acquire the potential to form mixtures and compounds, they are called vyain&#x32D;jana [consonants]. The diversity of creation is expressed through consonants, not through vowels. This is the logic behind the division of the Indo-Aryan alphabet into vowels and consonants.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->What is a mantra? It has already been stated that the starting point of shabda, para&#x301;bindu, exists both in the unit and in the [Cosmos]. In the flow of evolution, in the unit as well as in the Cosmic, shabda is born out of para&#x301;. Para&#x301; is the womb of all sounds. A mantra is a collection of a few particular shabdas - not each and every shabda. Mantra means &ldquo;that collection of sounds meditation on which leads to liberation&rdquo; &ndash; Manana&#x301;t ta&#x301;rayet yastu sah mantrah parikiirttitah. Man plus the root verb trae plus the suffix d&#x301;a make up the word mantra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->By way of illustration, suppose you are sitting somewhere and you do not have the strength to move. A gentleman happens to come that way. If you say to him, &ldquo;Come, sir, let&#146;s have a little talk,&rdquo; that will not prompt the gentleman to lift you by the hand and support your movement. If, on the other hand, you tell the gentleman, &ldquo;Come, sir, I don&#146;t have the strength to get up &ndash; please take my hand and lift me up,&rdquo; it may bring about that result. Thus we get the result we desire by means of an appropriate expression in words. In this illustration the seed of the idea was the same at the level of para&#x301;, but due to two different formations of expression, different results were obtained. A given expression carries a particular meaning for you, as it expresses a particular feeling and it possesses a particular value. In other words, when a particular feeling is expressed through a particular combination of sounds, it achieves a particular value. But even then it does not attain the status of a mantra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Unless the shabda or the collection of shabdas, when meditated upon, leads to the path of liberation, it cannot be called a mantra. Every mantra is thus sonic or vibrational and is vibrating simultaneously in the Cosmic system and in the unit body. When, with the help of a mantra, a person finally establishes the parallelism of the unit ectoplasmic vibration with the Cosmic vibration, that person gets mantra siddhi.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->And what is mantra caetanya, or the awakening of a mantra? Mantra caetanya is the condition where, with the help of a particular shabda, a person establishes parallelism between his or her external physical vibration and his or her internal ectoplasmic vibration, and then raises this to the spiritual level.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.8.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#8.fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> And the culmination of this process in the achievement of the final spiritual goal is called mantra siddhi. The same shabda without being made &ldquo;live&rdquo; or awakened in the above process is meaningless; it acquires force and meaning when it becomes &ldquo;live&rdquo; in the aforesaid manner. The parallelism between the internal ectoplasmic vibration and the external Cosmic vibration can only be established when one has complete control over one&#146;s own ectoplasmic vibration.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->According to one&#146;s sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras, a person will be vibrated immediately by one shabda, but remain immune to the vibrations of another. Thus some people get angry when you say &ldquo;Sita&#x301;-Ra&#x301;m&rdquo; to them, but are pleased when you greet them with &ldquo;Ra&#x301;dhe-Shya&#x301;m&rdquo;. Our attitude towards different shabdas becomes defined.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->It will be noted that many writers repeat the use of particular words. Many, for instance, use the word &ldquo;but&rdquo; in every other sentence. All this happens because of their attachment to particular rhythmic vibrations. Similarly, when the vibrational expression is ectoplasmic, that is, when the individual gets equilibrated with the Cosmic vibration, [Cosmic] mantra caetanya takes place.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->As already mentioned, not only human existence but every existence in this universe is vibrational. But the vibrations of each individual, of each object, differ from those of other objects. For instance, there is a difference between the vibrational expression of iron and that of gold. Just as the vibrations of a human differ from those of iron or gold, the vibrations between one human and another also differ. A person&#146;s life is nothing but a mesh of multilateral rhythms, and the goal of human life is a singular Entity having no rhythm.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->The style of a person&#146;s speech represents a particular rhythm of his or her own. The way the person eats represents the rhythm of his/her own eating. Every person is thus special on account of these specialities. The rhythms of two individuals cannot be identical. An individual rhythm is the particular property of a particular person. It has been said in A&#x301;nanda Su&#x301;tram:<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.8.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#8.fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> Vaecitryam&#x301; pra&#x301;krtadharmah sama&#x301;nam&#x301; na bhavis&#x301;yati [&ldquo;Diversity, not identity, is the law of nature&rdquo;]. In this universe every person in every action possesses a particular rhythm of his own. If someone wants to obstruct or strike that rhythm through disciplinary measures or expressions of anger, the person will not tolerate it. Personal liberty &ndash; individual liberty &ndash; really means the unobstructed expression of individual rhythmic vibrations.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->When with the help of one&#146;s para&#x301;shakti (para&#x301; in the sense of the starting point of shabda and not in the context of para&#x301; and apara&#x301;) a person coincides his or her individual rhythmic vibrations with the rhythmic vibrations in the realm of this quinquelemental universe, from that moment onwards his or her rhythms become vibrated with mantra caetanya. This is the awakening of, or putting life into, a mantra. Therefore Sada&#x301;shiva has said:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..13"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Caetanyarahita&#x301;h mantra&#x301;h prokta&#x301;h varn&#x301;a&#x301;stu kevalam<br>Phalam&#x301; naeva prayachanti laks&#x301;akot&#x301;ijapaerapi.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->In order to make a mantra &ldquo;live&rdquo;, the individual rhythms have to be made parallel to the Cosmic rhythms. Then the starting point of expression of the unit will have to be made to coincide with the starting point of expression in the Cosmic field. &ldquo;If this has not been done,&rdquo; says the shloka, &ldquo;even hundreds of thousands, even millions, of repetitions of the mantra will not lead to mantra siddhi.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->There are several essential factors to bring about mantra caetanya. The first is that the mantra should suit the sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ra of the individual concerned. And the second is that the individual should feel a fraternal emotion for and attachment to the external world. This sentimental contact with the external world is a must. If someone is under the impression that &ldquo;I am doing sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; for the sake of personal liberation and I have nothing to do with the world,&rdquo; and thus denies his or her contact with external physicality, although the person&#146;s physical body is very much in this world, the person is cheating himself and indulging in selfishness. Service to humanity with a view to serve Parama Purus&#x301;a and with the same attachment which one feels towards oneself and Parama Purus&#x301;a is an essential prerequisite for progress in sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. This will establish the equilibrium and parallelism of the individual rhythms with the rhythms of the external physicalities.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->The microcosm is in a dormant state, and the jiivabha&#x301;va, the feeling of the unit state, is in a condition of slumber. The point where the jiivabha&#x301;va, that is, the sense of the unit identity, is locked, is called kula. Hence those who achieve perfection through sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; are called kaola. (Kaola, with this meaning, is also used as a surname.) Those who can move the collective ectoplasm through the medium of their ectoplasmic rhythm, can awaken new power in shabda through their own ectoplasmic strength. The awakening of this power in shabda is called purashcaran&#x301;a in Sanskrit. And those who can perform such a tough task are called Maha&#x301;kaola. They alone are worthy of the status of guru and no one else. When a Maha&#x301;kaola awakens vibrations in the universal ectoplasmic body through the medium of particular shabdas, those shabdas [are also altered and] acquire the status of siddha mantras. A spiritual aspirant can only achieve perfection through the medium of those siddha mantras. Other mantras are not capable of leading to success, and spiritual aspirants cannot awaken them. A person&#146;s individual efforts will never be sufficient for that task.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Every person has certain mental limitations. He or she can only proceed to a certain extent and then cannot do anything further. Further progress requires special power and special grace. And this power and grace of God are always available for everyone. But people must use their existing strength in order to utilize that grace.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->What is the range of these shabdas, whose troughs and crests are expressed in vibrational rhythms? The medium as well as the spirit of the human&#146;s individual life are personal, but in the Cosmic body, as well as in the case of less-developed creatures, the spirit is personal or individual but the medium is impersonal or Cosmic. An existence where the medium is impersonal [or Cosmic] but the spirit is individual is called an animal existence. In other words, any progress in the life of an animal is due to the vibrational power of Parama Purus&#x301;a; the medium therefore is Cosmic or impersonal, but the spirit is individual. The progress which is attained through the personal spirit and impersonal medium is towards Parama Purus&#x301;a Himself. Therefore there is no chance of a spiritual fall in the life of an animal. Animals are set firmly on a path of gradual progress.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->As the medium is impersonal, the growth in animals is from the crude to the subtle. But when due to engagement in subtler activities the medium also acquires individual influence, when its [mental] colour and its feeling do not remain entirely impersonal, gradually thinking and intellect are born. We find this in developed animals. The transformation in a dog is due to the effect of the personal, or individual, medium on the impersonal medium; this does not occur in lower creatures.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->There is a big difference between a wild Alsatian in a jungle and one who is a pet. The medium of the one is influenced by the impersonal, that of the other is under the impact of an educated person. When in a living being the influence of the personal or individual surpasses the influence of the impersonal [or Cosmic], at that point the frame of that being can no longer be called animal but is called a human being. So this is the human status.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->Due to one&#146;s individual effort, para&#x301; gradually develops step by step into pashyantii, madhyama&#x301;, [dyotama&#x301;na], shrutigocara&#x301; and vaekharii.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.8.fn5"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#8.fn5">5</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> These steps are from the subtle to the crude.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Similarly in the Cosmic order, development is from the subtle to the crude, as the medium there is Universal Mind. The vibrational principle appears in the third phase of extroversial development. This vibrational principle is fully operative in matter and in the bodies and minds of undeveloped and underdeveloped creatures. The same vibrational principle functions in the human body when it starts from the point of para&#x301; and gets full extroversial expression. When a person will awaken caetanya in a mantra, that is, when he or she will do purashcaran&#x301;a, he or she will move from negativity to positivity, from human para&#x301;bindu to human sahasra&#x301;ra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->The starting point of the vibrational principle is the culminating or last point of the primordial principle. In other words, the last point of the primordial expression and the starting point of the vibrational faculty are one and the same. The movement after mantra caetanya is from the fundamental negativity to the fundamental positivity. In other words, this movement will be the reverse of the movement of the vibrational faculty; it will be from crude to subtle and not from subtle to crude. In the vibrational principle, the first crest and trough are far apart, and thereafter the distance becomes shorter and shorter. In spiritual practice, the first troughs and crests will be frequent, and then the intervals will gradually lengthen till a straight line is formed. Thus, in the second phase, that is, in the returning phase, the vibrational principle will be reconverted into the primordial principle and the primordial principle or primordial faculty will ultimately convert itself into the basic faculty.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.8.fn6"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#8.fn6">6</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  This  movement, however, is only possible after the mantra has become [awakened], not before that.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->Spiritual practice is essential for human beings; and for spiritual practice initiation is necessary. And those human beings who do not perform spiritual practice are under the influence of the Cosmic principle. They are guided by the Cosmic rhythmic order, but as this is an impersonal entity they will never be able to enjoy liberation or salvation. So what is the way out? In what direction must they move after mantra caetanya? They have to do an about-turn and cross the three phases described above. They have to return to their original abode. They have to merge back into the One from where their existence sprang.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..25"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->A&#x301;nando brahmeti byaja&#x301;nat<br>A&#x301;nanda&#x301;dhyeva khalvima&#x301;ni bhu&#x301;ta&#x301;ni ja&#x301;yante<br>A&#x301;nandena ja&#x301;ta&#x301;ni jiivanti<br>A&#x301;nandam&#x301; prayantyabhisam&#x301;vishantiiti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..26"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->[Know ye that a&#x301;nanda, bliss, is Brahma. It is out of a&#x301;nandam that the five fundamental factors have emerged. All created beings live within a&#x301;nandam, and finally merge with a&#x301;nandam.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->What then is to be done? The scriptures say that you do not have to exert very much. I have said before that there can be no progress either in the realm of physicality or in the realm of intellectuality. Those who are hankering for progress in these fields are indulging in a self-cheating business. Whether they admit it or not, they know that they know nothing. Ask them whether they are getting pleasure in the realm of physicality. They will admit that they are not. Ask a good businessman whether he is earning good profits. His reply will be, &ldquo;What profit? I am incurring losses.&rdquo; This will be his reply whether you belong to Income Tax Department or not! To run after progress in the realm of physicality and intellectuality is utter foolishness, a waste of time, as there is no progress in these fields. But I have already said that you may make efforts in these directions provided you can convert or metamorphose them into spirituality. But as far as spiritual sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is concerned, or as far as efforts to achieve bliss are concerned, there is no touch of pain in them, as bliss is infinite pleasure alone. Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; then is what wise men have to do. And in sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, the first thing to be done is to use mantra caetanya.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->In simple words, what we have to do is to return home from where we came. We have all come from Parama Purus&#x301;a &ndash; the Supreme Entity &ndash; and from the pra&#x301;n&#x301;a-kendra, the nucleus of the universe &ndash; that is, Purus&#x301;ottama. We have to return to the same place. It is like a boy who has played throughout the day away in the fields, and now that evening comes, returns home. Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is the process of returning home. The child has played outside for the whole day. As evening approaches, he thinks, &ldquo;Father must have returned home. Let me also return home and sit next to him.&rdquo; When one is tired of this world and worldliness, one yearns to go back to spirituality, that is, to one&#146;s home.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->And what is our permanent abode &ndash; our home? It is Parama Purus&#x301;a parama&#x301;shrayah Shriiniva&#x301;sah. Here shrii refers to the Universal Creative Faculty, or Parama&#x301; Prakrti. The abode of this Universal Faculty is also your abode. Therefore going home is a simple task. It requires no scholarship, no knowledge, no intellectual faculty &ndash; no long and tedious lecturing. The scriptures tell us to remember three points in order to return home. They are shravana [hearing about the Supreme], manana [ideating on the Supreme] and nidi-dhya&#x301;sana [meditating on the Supreme with an unbroken flow of mind].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->We know that the vibrational faculty converts subtler waves into cruder waves in the phase of creation. Hari katha&#x301; [devotional talk] provides subtler vibrations. You must allow yourself to receive these subtler waves. It has already been said that sound waves are the subtlest in the chain of Cosmic expression. The importance of Hari katha&#x301; in spiritual development is great. Hearing about God is much more important than studies in spirituality, as sound is subtler than visual form. Therefore wherever there is an opportunity, listen to His name and speak it to others.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->When you speak His name to others, you also hear it. This dual enjoyment in reciting His name is called kiirtana. Bhajana, on the other hand, is hearing His name by oneself.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.8.fn7"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#8.fn7">7</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> You must do both &ndash; both bhajana and kiirtana. This is shravana. The effect of shravana is that vibrations of sound which are moving from crude to subtle are set in motion against the flow in the vibrational faculty, where wordly sounds are moving from subtle to crude. This will set in reverse motion a flow of sounds, and this will take one up to the starting point of the vibrational faculty.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->I have already stated that the starting point of the vibrational faculty and the culminating point of the primordial faculty are one and the same. You will therefore reach the culminating point of the primordial faculty. The vibrational phase is called bhava &ndash; also bhava sa&#x301;gara or bhava pa&#x301;ra&#x301;va&#x301;ra [ocean of creation]. The word bhava thus denotes the entire realm of the vibrational principle. This is the world of mundane involvements. The Caetanya, or Cognitive Principle of this faculty is called Bhava, and the Shakti, or Operative Principle of this faculty is called Bhava&#x301;nii Shakti. This is the worldly bondage. Only through the medium of Hari katha&#x301; can one cross this ocean of bhava, the entire range of the vibrational faculty.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->Thereafter comes manana, that is, thinking only about Parama Purus&#x301;a and about no one else.

<a name="8..34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->At this point you meet the basic faculty or basic principle. The basic principle or faculty is a point in the unbalanced triangle of forces. It is situated at a particular vertex of the triangle of forces. Manana can take you up to that point.

The fact is that even after surrendering everything to Parama Purus&#x301;a, your arch-enemy &ndash; the &ldquo;I&rdquo; &ndash; remains. Because you will say, &ldquo;I have surrendered everything to God.&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rdquo;, &ldquo;I&rdquo;, &ldquo;I&rdquo; &ndash; my friend, surrender that &ldquo;I&rdquo; to God.

It is most difficult to give it up. Thus in the above shloka, the devotee exclaims, &ldquo;O Lord, this universe is Your abode. It is full of precious jewels. Whatever of value exists in this world belongs to You. What precious gift can I give to You? You have no desire for anything. What is the use of offering anything to one whose house is full of precious jewels? The almighty Prakrti is Your own consort; at Your will She will make innumerable jewels in a moment &ndash; aghat&#x301;ana ghat&#x301;ana pat&#x301;iiyasii Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; [&lsquo;the dexterous hand of  Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; that can even create things impossible to create&rsquo;] &ndash; this creative power is ever ready to serve You. O Lord of lords, although I have a yearning to offer You something, I do not know what that thing should be. Although I want to offer, You have no desire or want. If You lack nothing, what can I offer? If I knew of anything that You did not possess, I would offer it to You.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..40"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=40 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;O Lord of lords, we hear that Your great devotees have stolen Your mind from You. The Lord becomes the slave of his devotees. A devotee steals the heart of the Lord &ndash; almost forcibly. The deed is performed openly and not in secrecy. Therefore, O Lord, You lack one thing &ndash; You have no mind.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..41"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=41 type=paragraph -->The devotee says, &ldquo;Despair not, O Lord, I am offering my mind to You. Please accept it.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..42"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=42 type=paragraph -->This offer of one&#146;s mind to the Lord is nididhya&#x301;sana. The inner sense of nididhya&#x301;sana is that all the propensities of the mind are to be concentrated at a point to be offered to Parama Purus&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..43"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=43 type=paragraph -->Today the human mind consists of fifty dominant propensities. Definitely when the human structure becomes more complex in the course of evolution, the number of these propensities will also increase. The number of these vrttis is not going to remain fifty forever. It will increase. Similarly, the number of glands will increase, and so also the number of sub-glands. Not only will the number of mental propensities increase; the propensities will also undergo change. The concept of beauty will also change with the change in outlook of the human mind. An owl may then appear beautiful and a peacock ugly.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..44"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=44 type=paragraph -->Shravana therefore enables one to cross the vibrational faculty. Manana enables one to cross the primordial faculty. And nididhya&#x301;sana makes it possible to merge with the Supreme Entity. This is God-realization. The essential thing therefore is to awaken the mantra, whether one also does intellectual things such as reading and writing or not. What is important is to have proper shravana, manana and nidi-dhya&#x301;sana. If one does this, one will no longer find it difficult to learn to do anything. Mantra caetanya is sure to lead to mantra siddhi, to the attainment of the supreme goal. The process of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; will automatically arouse devotion.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..45"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=45 type=paragraph -->When you come in close contact with the Supreme Entity, you will find that you have no wealth superior to devotion. All worldly possessions will prove of no avail. Only devotion enables you to come into close contact with Him. This is the goal of human life. This is true progress.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..46"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=46 type=paragraph -->You have been wandering through the labyrinth of a myriad of lives. You have been ever advancing toward this stage. Knowingly or unknowingly, you are being drawn unto Him. This is the summum bonum of life. As long as you have not realized Him, there is no siddhi in your life.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="9..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Virtue and vice are temporal entities. These things have nothing to do so far as a person&#146;s relationship with the Supreme Father is concerned.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Suppose several boys are moving along a particular road and one particular boy falls into the drain. His dress, his body, become dirty; other people, passers-by, will laugh at him, but when the boy&#146;s father sees his boy in that condition, what is he to do? Will he laugh at his own son? No, no, no. What will he do? He himself will go there, into the drain, and take his boy in his own lap, and clean his dress, clean his clothes, clean his body; and after that he will say, &ldquo;My boy, you should walk carefully.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Sinning persons are just like those boys in the drain. Now, high or low, upgraded or degraded, all are equal, all are equal for Him, because heaven is His creation, and hell is His creation. If we say that He is only in heaven, it will not be a correct utterance, because He is in hell also. His sons, His daughters, are never alone. He is with you even in hell.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->What are you to do? You are always to remember that you are the child of a Great Father. You must not think that you are a sinner, you are a degraded person. If you think that you are a sinner, it means you are meditating on sin! And when sin has become your object of meditation, actually you will become a sinner, because a person becomes just like his or her object of ideation, object of meditation. If you always meditate on sin, &ldquo;I am a sinner, I am a sinner,&rdquo; actually you will become a sinner. The psychological approach is, you should forget it &ndash; even if you are actually a sinner, you should think, &ldquo;I am the son of a Great Father, I am the son of a Great Father, I am the son of a Great Father.&rdquo; And thus you are meditating on the Great Father, and a day is sure to come when you will become one with your Great Father. But to think, &ldquo;I am a sinner, I am a sinner, oh Father, save me, oh Father, save me,&rdquo; is a defective approach! You should say, &ldquo;I am your son, I am your daughter, oh Father, take me on your lap, I am your son, I am your daughter.&rdquo; This will be the approach. You should forget what you do not want.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Now in the phase of creation, the first point of creation is called Shambhu&#x301;liun&#x32D;ga. Liun&#x32D;ga means &ldquo;the point, the supreme point, the terminus of all expressions, all movements&rdquo;. And that terminus is a singular entity. In the phase of extrovert, it is the starting-point, and in the phase of introvert, it is the culminating point. It is the Supreme Desideratum.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->At this starting-point, wherefrom the first expression takes place in the first phase of creation, what happens? In that triangle of forces, triangle of principles, sentient, mutative and static, what happens due to their intertransmutation? All of a sudden the triangle becomes unbalanced, and the released resultant force comes out from one of the vertices of the triangle. There are three vertices, and it comes out from one of the vertices. And the point from which this extroversial force comes out is called Shambhu&#x301;. In the phase of extrovert, in the phase of creation, it is Shambhu&#x301;; and in the phase of introvert also it is Shambhu&#x301;. In the phase of creation it is the starting point, it is the fundamental positivity. It is the fundamental positivity because in it lies the seed of all creation. And in the phase of introvert, it is the Supreme Desideratum, because here in this point all the aspirations, all the hopes, all the desires, of all living beings terminate.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Similarly, in the unit structure, in each and every unit structure, there is a starting-point, a microscopic expression of Shambhu&#x301; in the entire Macrocosm. That is, in the entire Cosmological order there is a Shambhu&#x301; point, the starting-point, and similarly, in the unit expression, in the microcosm, there is Shambhu&#x301; in miniature form, in microcosmic form, controlling the microcosm. And it is this point [crown of the head], the controlling point of the pineal gland. It is the site of Parama Purus&#x301;a, Paramashiva. And in the phase of creation, while Shambhu&#x301; is the starting-point, the last point of creation, the crudest point, is called Svayambhu&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Shambhu&#x301; and Svayambhu&#x301;. In Sanskrit, sham means &ldquo;to control&rdquo;, and bhu&#x301; means [&ldquo;created&rdquo;]. So shambhu&#x301; means &ldquo;the controller, self-created controller&rdquo;. And Svayambhu&#x301; &ndash; svayam means &ldquo;self&rdquo;, [so svayambhu&#x301; means] &ldquo;self-created&rdquo;. But it is not the controller, because it is the crudest point. It is the last point, the crudest point.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Now, wherever there is any expression or wherever there is no expression, the Witnessing Entity is there, just like the light of a stage, a theatrical stage. When there is an actor, the light is there, witnessing the activities of the actor. The actor says something, recites something, and the light of the stage witnesses the activities of that particular actor. And when a singer comes, that light witnesses the activities of the singer. A dancer comes, and that very light witnesses the activities of the dancer. And when nobody is present &ndash; no actor, no dancer, no singer &ndash; the light, that very light, witnesses that &ldquo;Nobody is present here now.&rdquo; It expresses the fact before the audience, before the spectators, that there is nobody on the stage. Similarly, where there is expression, that Cosmic Light, that Cosmic Father, is there. And where there is no expression, the Father is there to say that nobody is present now &ndash; just like that light of the theatrical stage.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Now in the case of Shambhu&#x301;liun&#x32D;ga, the fundamental positivity from where the creation starts, the Supreme Entity is there. And where the creation terminates, the last point, the crudest point, the Svayambhu&#x301;liun&#x32D;ga &ndash; the Witnessing Entity is there also, the Supreme Father is there also. Now in [Shambhu&#x301;liun&#x32D;ga], the human entity, the entity of a living being, is in subtlest form, is in purest form, is in unadulterated form. And in Svayambhu&#x301;liun&#x32D;ga, in the lowest point, in the lowest bone, of your body, the created being, the living being, is in crudest form. Because of that crudest expression, the living being will also be in crudest form. That is, all one&#146;s divinity, one&#146;s divinity in its entirety, is sleeping there, is in latent form there, in the last bone of the body. That sleeping divinity &ndash; actually it is divinity, but it is sleeping &ndash; is called kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii in Sanskrit, &ldquo;coiled serpentine&rdquo; in English. &ldquo;Coiled serpentine&rdquo;. It is just like a serpentine loop.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Now, by dint of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; &ndash; what is sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;? Whenever a sa&#x301;dhaka gets his or her own peculiar incantation from his a&#x301;ca&#x301;rya, his or her own mantra to be practised, that sleeping divinity, kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii, is aroused by the vibration of that mantra. And by dint of the person&#146;s constant practice, regular practice, what happens? It moves that serpentine loop upward. Its original residence is in the mu&#x301;la&#x301;dha&#x301;ra cakra, the lowermost cakra. Now when the sa&#x301;dhaka by dint of his or her sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, intuitional practice, exalts that kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii, and when the kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii crosses the sva&#x301;dhis&#x301;t&#x301;ha&#x301;na cakra, the next higher cakra, the sa&#x301;dhaka&#146;s feeling, his or her expression, his or her status, is known as sa&#x301;lokya. It is the first stage of sama&#x301;dhi. A sa&#x301;dhaka by constant practice is sure to attain that status. But you know, the yogis say that a sa&#x301;dhaka cannot attain that status without the special favour of the spiritual guru. This is what they say. That stage is called sa&#x301;lokya.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Sa&#x301;lokya means that the sa&#x301;dhaka feels that in the stratum, or sphere, where he or she is, where that person&#146;s exalted mind is, he or she is not alone; the Supreme Father is also there. This sama&#x301;dhi, where the feeling is that in the stratum, or status, where the person is, that person&#146;s Supreme Father is also there, gives the person very much pleasure. This first pleasure is called sa&#x301;lokya sama&#x301;dhi.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Then when this coiled serpentine, sleeping divinity, crosses the man&#x301;ipura cakra, just near the hub, the controlling point, of the pancreas, the person enjoys another sort of pleasure, and that pleasure is called sa&#x301;miipya sama&#x301;dhi. Sa&#x301;miipya is a Sanskrit word. It means &ldquo;proximity&rdquo;. That is, the sa&#x301;dhaka feels his or her proximity to the Supreme Father.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->In the first stage, the sa&#x301;dhaka felt that the Supreme Father was there in the same status. He is not in the sky, he is everywhere, He is with you. If you are here and He is in the sky, then you are alone here, and He is also alone there. No, no, no, no. In the first phase the feeling was that &ldquo;Where I am, He is also with me.&rdquo; And in the second phase, &ldquo;I have come very close, very near, that Supreme Father; I am in close proximity to the Supreme Progenitor. By dint of my sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, the gap between my Father and myself is being bridged.&rdquo; It is the second phase, known as sa&#x301;miipya. Sa&#x301;miipya means &ldquo;proximity&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Then when that sleeping divinity, that kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii, crosses the ana&#x301;hata cakra, this plexus, this &ldquo;solar plexus&rdquo; (in Latin), the sa&#x301;dhaka&#146;s feelings are known as sa&#x301;yujya. Sa&#x301;yujya means &ldquo;in close contact&rdquo;. In Sanskrit sa&#x301;yujya means &ldquo;close contact, just side by side, just touching&rdquo;. In sa&#x301;lokya He is with you. In sa&#x301;miipya you feel the proximity, the nearness. And here in sa&#x301;yujya what do you feel? A tactual experience. You get a tactual experience.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Then when by dint of your sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; the divinity, the sleeping divinity, the kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii, crosses this point [the throat], one will experience another sort of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, a subtler sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, subtler sama&#x301;dhi. And that one is called sa&#x301;ru&#x301;pya. In sa&#x301;ru&#x301;pya the feeling is &ldquo;I am one with Him.&rdquo; &ldquo;I am one with Him&rdquo; &ndash; not close contact, but oneness. &ldquo;I am one with the Supreme Progenitor, I am one with the Supreme Cognition.&rdquo; This is sa&#x301;rupya.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Then by still more sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, when the sleeping divinity crosses this point [between the eyebrows], the controlling point of the pituitary gland, the a&#x301;jin&#x32D;a&#x301; cakra, the sa&#x301;dhaka&#146;s feelings, or experiences &ndash; another sort of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, still more high &ndash; are known as sa&#x301;rs&#x301;t&#x301;hi in Sanskrit. At that point, the feeling is that &ldquo;I am He;&rdquo; that is, &ldquo;I&rdquo; and &ldquo;He&rdquo;, these two entities, have become one. &ldquo;I am;&rdquo; but &ldquo;He&rdquo; and &ldquo;I&rdquo; have coincided.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;I&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;He&rdquo;. There is one gap. &ldquo;I am the Supreme Entity, I am the Supreme Entity.&rdquo; There is still the connecting link &ldquo;am&rdquo;. But when &ldquo;I&rdquo; and &ldquo;Supreme Entity&rdquo; coincide, the gap &ldquo;am&rdquo; disappears. &ldquo;I&rdquo;, &ldquo;Supreme Entity&rdquo;, and the connecting link &ldquo;am&rdquo;. When this will coincide with this, the connecting &ldquo;am&rdquo; will disappear, because there is no gap. &ldquo;I&rdquo; becomes one with &ldquo;He&rdquo;. Clear? Or &ldquo;He&rdquo; becomes one with &ldquo;I&rdquo;. This stage is called sa&#x301;rs&#x301;t&#x301;hi.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->And the last stage is when that kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii comes here [crown of the head]. I said that in the unit structure, Shambhu&#x301;liun&#x32D;ga, Parama Purus&#x301;a, is here, at the controlling point of the pineal gland. The divinity, the sleeping divinity, is to be exalted to that point, to the controlling point of the pineal gland. And there is the final stage of sama&#x301;dhi. That final stage of sama&#x301;dhi is called nirvikalpa sama&#x301;dhi in yoga, and kaevalya in Tantra. In Sanskrit kaevalya means &ldquo;only&rdquo;. Kevala means &ldquo;only&rdquo;, and the noun of kevala is kaevalya.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->That is, only one entity exists. That entity may be I, that entity may be He. But the differentiation between &ldquo;I&rdquo; and &ldquo;He&rdquo; disappears. So &ldquo;I exist&rdquo; and &ldquo;He exists&rdquo; &ndash; these two ideas disappear: &ldquo;exists&rdquo;. That is, it is the stage of non-attributional consciousness. It is the supreme stage of yogic sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. It is the supreme stance for a yogi.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->Now by dint of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, one is to arouse and exalt that sleeping divinity. That Svayambhu&#x301;liun&#x32D;ga becomes one with Shambhu&#x301;liun&#x32D;ga.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->But for this one requires divine help. And I know one is sure to get divine help. And I know further that one is getting divine help. And I know still further that in future, for infinite time and infinite space, one will be getting this divine favour. And you are all sa&#x301;dhakas. You will certainly attain that supreme stance and enjoy that divine blessedness. You are sure to enjoy it, my sons and my daughters.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="10..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The word mantra in Sanskrit is very meaningful, and it has no synonymous term in any other language. Manana&#x301;t ta&#x301;rayet yastu sah mantrah parikiirttitah &ndash; &ldquo;Mantra is that particular word whose repetition or auto-suggestion or outer-suggestion helps the microcosm free itself of all the fetters of physical and psychic life.&rdquo; Man plus trae plus d&#x301;a is the derivation of the term.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Now for a mantra two things are essential. It must be meaningful, that is, in the ordinary sense of the term the word should have proper significance; and at the same time it must be supported by the proper acoustic root, that is, it must be supported by acoustic propriety. In the realm of spirituality, each and every term should have these two meanings &ndash; one the mundane significance, and the other the acoustic significance.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Take the word krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. The root verb is krs&#x301;. One meaning of krs&#x301; is &ldquo;to attract&rdquo;. So the faculty that attracts everything towards itself is krs&#x301; plus n&#x301;a, that is, &ldquo;Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&rdquo;, the all-attracting, all-attractive faculty of the world, the nucleus of the universe. &ldquo;Krs&#x301;na&rdquo; means Purus&#x301;ottama, the nucleus of the entire Cosmic order, because it comes from the root verb krs&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Another meaning of krs&#x301; is &ldquo;to be&rdquo;. A sa&#x301;dhaka says that &ldquo;Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&rdquo; means, &ldquo;I exist because He exists,&rdquo; &ldquo;My existence is dependent on His existence.&rdquo; Krs&#x301; means &ldquo;to be&rdquo;, &ldquo;to exist&rdquo; &ndash; that&#146;s why He is &ldquo;Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&rdquo;. &ldquo;He is my life&#146;s life. He is the supreme existence behind all my existences in so many frameworks, in so many structures, in so many lives.&rdquo; That&#146;s why He is &ldquo;Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Among so many colours, the dark colour is most attractive, and for that reason in Sanskrit &ldquo;dark&rdquo; is also one meaning of krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. And so far as the acoustic root is concerned  the acoustic root of Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a is klrm&#x301;. The Sanskrit term, the Sanskrit acoustic root (not just Sanskrit &ndash; the acoustic root is universal for the entire Cosmos) of Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a is klrm&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->What is klrm&#x301;? Ka + lr. And what is ka? The word ka has three meanings in Sanskrit.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->One, it is the first consonant of the Sanskritic alphabetical order. The second meaning of ka is as follows. You know in the phase of expression or manifestation, that is, when the Noumenal Cause is translated into the phenomenal effect, the sound created (during this phase of translation) is ka; and that is why ka is the first letter of our alphabetical order.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->The entity from which this phase or this process of translation starts, from which the process of metamorphosis starts, is represented by the sound aum. Because in it, within its scope, lie the faculties of creation, preservation and destruction.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->The acoustic root of creation is a. First comes creation, then follows everything else &ndash; and that is why a is the first vowel. A is the first letter of the Indo-Aryan alphabetical order.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->First creation &ndash; When the Supreme Entity creates something, this creation takes place within the periphery of the Macrocosmic order; but a stir is created in the Macrocosm during the phase of creation, and wherever there is a stir, there is movement, there are waves &ndash; light waves, acoustic waves and so on. When He desires to create something, the stir created in the Macrocosm is represented by the sound a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->And in the next phase He is to preserve those created beings. So in that Macrocosmic structure another stir is created representing the desire to preserve. And that is represented by the sound u. And the point from which the culminating march starts is represented by the sound ma, hence ma is the last letter of the vargiiya varn&#x301;ama&#x301;la&#x301;.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.10.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#10.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> The pa varga is the last varga, and ma is the last sound of the pa varga  pa, pha, ba, bha, ma. So the creating personality is represented by these three sounds &ndash; a, u, and ma &ndash; the Generating Entity, the Preserving Entity and the Destructive Entity. (Here everybody should remember that His destruction is not the destruction of ordinary living beings. His destruction means withdrawal  withdrawing the created being from the phenomenal world to its noumenal cause. Just a play of withdrawal, and nothing more than that.) The Generator, the Operator, the Destructor &ndash; if we take the first letter of &ldquo;generator&rdquo;, &ldquo;g&rdquo;; of &ldquo;operator&rdquo;, &ldquo;o&rdquo;; and of &ldquo;destructor&rdquo;, &ldquo;d&rdquo;; we get G-O-D, &ldquo;God&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Now, while this Supreme Entity, the Supreme Subjectivity, the Supreme witnessing faculty, creates something, then He is aum. Aum gets as its counterpart the objective world, this quinquelemental universe; and this world of objectivity is represented by the acoustic root ka. Hence, aum is the Ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a Brahma, or Causal Brahma, and ka is the Ka&#x301;rya Brahma, the Effect Brahma. The second meaning of ka is the Effect Brahma, the objectivated universe.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->So the first meaning of ka is that it is the first consonant. The second meaning is this objectivated world or effect world. And the third meaning of ka is &ldquo;water&rdquo;. A few days back I told you that kaccha means &ldquo;the land surrounded by water&rdquo;: ka means &ldquo;water&rdquo; and cha means &ldquo;surrounded by&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->The acoustic root of Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a is klrm&#x301;. The first letter is ka. Ka means the objectivated world. The entity that preserves this objectivated world is ka. (Human beings who have taken the responsibility, the moral responsibility, of serving this ka, that is, of serving this objectivated world, are called ka&#x301;pa&#x301;lika. Our avadhu&#x301;tas and avadhu&#x301;tika&#x301;s practise ka&#x301;pa&#x301;lika sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, that is, they do the pa&#x301;lana kriya&#x301; of ka, they do the pa&#x301;lana kriya&#x301; of this objectivated world. They are to serve humanity.) The first letter is ka and the second is la. La represents solid entities; that is, everything converted into solid is represented by the acoustic root la. Now, the divine faculty that serves, or helps, or rather vibrates, the entire objectivated world, and keeps close proximity to the material world (at the same time vibrating the entire objectivated universe), is ka + la. Hence the acoustic root of Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a is klrm&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Similarly, all mantras must have two meanings. One meaning is the mundane significance, and the other is the acoustic root. And wherever either meaning is wanting, the word cannot be treated as a mantra. That is why I said the word mantra cannot be properly represented by the word &ldquo;incantation&rdquo;. But for want of a proper word in English, we find no alternative but to use the word &ldquo;incantation&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Similarly for Shiva. One name of Shiva is Hara. Ha represents the ethereal stratum, and ra represents energy &ndash; kriya&#x301;shakti, electrical energy, magnetic energy, etc. All these energies are represented by the acoustic root ra. So ha plus ra means &ldquo;the entity that rules over the entire ethereal plane and at the same time controls all the energies of the universe&rdquo;. Hara is the acoustic root of Lord Shiva.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->So only when a particular word has both a mundane meaning and an acoustic root may it be accepted as a mantra &ndash; if, that is, it is recognized as a siddha mantra by a Maha&#x301;kaola, by a Maha&#x301;sambhu&#x301;ti. Otherwise it is not a mantra.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="11..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Do you know what a saying is? It is a collection of words. And what is a word? A collection of syllables. And what is a syllable? A collection of letters. And what is a letter? A [sound having a] particular wavelength, or a particular acoustic expression. Everything comes out of the Supreme Entity, so many waves of light, sound, so many waves of tactual vibration&#8230; Ssh! &ndash; hot! Tssh! &ndash; very cold! These are all tactual variations having different wavelengths. Similarly, the acoustic wave, which means the expression of sound, also comes from the very source, from the very nucleus, from the very controlling point of the universe &ndash; who, we say, is Parama Purus&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Sounds are innumerable. Say, the English letter &ldquo;a&rdquo;. In the English language this sound &ldquo;a&rdquo; has twenty-two types of pronunciation. A-N-T, &ldquo;ant&rdquo;. But E-L-E-P-H-A-N-T  &ldquo;eleph-ent&rdquo;, not &ldquo;eleph-ant&rdquo;. Here, A-N-T is not &ldquo;ant&rdquo; but &ldquo;ent&rdquo;. The same A-N-T will be pronounced ant [&ldquo;ahn&rdquo;] in French, elephant [&ldquo;elephahn&rdquo;]. The same vowel or same consonant may have so many sounds. Even in the case of the pictorial expression of sound, a particular figure may be pronounced in a particular way in Mandarin, in a particular way in Shanghailese, in a particular way in Cantonese, in a particular way in North Japan, in a particular way in South Japan. So many expressions, innumerable expressions, of human vocality. &ldquo;Acoustic&rdquo; means &ldquo;pertaining to &ndash;&rdquo; &ndash; what? The Latin term for &ldquo;concerning sound&rdquo; is &ldquo;acoustic&rdquo;, and for &ldquo;concerning ear&rdquo;, &ldquo;auricular&rdquo;; &ldquo;concerning eye&rdquo;, &ldquo;ocular&rdquo;; &ldquo;concerning seeing&rdquo;, &ldquo;optical&rdquo;. All these are Latin words.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->These many expressions are all sacred. All sounds are sacred, no sound can be bad, because all come from that Entity. All human expressions are certainly sacred. All languages are certainly sacred. That is why I pay respect, I pay reverence, to all languages of the world. All have the same dignity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Now if we try to bring those expressions &ndash; so many expressions &ndash; together, it will be beyond human capacity, but we may try. And as a result of human endeavour, those expressions have been brought within the range of fifty main sounds. Those fifty main sounds are controlled by fifty main glands and sub-glands of the human body.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->In the morning span I was saying something regarding the pancreas. There are ten sub-glands; each and every sub-gland has a particular sound. Amongst the fifty sounds, ten are controlled by the pancreas &ndash; d&#x301;a, d&#x301;ha, n&#x301;a, ta, tha, da, dha, na, pa, and pha. Each and every sound has something to do with the physical world and with the mental world. These ten sounds control ten propensities of the human mind &ndash; shyness, fear, etc.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Suppose all those sounds are expressed at one time. What will happen? Suppose you go to a market. Somebody will say, &ldquo;What&#146;s the rate of potato?&rdquo; Somebody else will say, &ldquo;What&#146;s the rate of brinjal [eggplant]? What&#146;s the rate of meat?&rdquo; &ndash; like this. And the shopkeeper will say, &ldquo;I want this much;&rdquo; and the customer will say, &ldquo;No, no, no, I won&#146;t give more than that.&rdquo; So many sounds. But if you go, say, about one hundred yards from the market, what will be the sound? Something like &ldquo;hawawawawa&rdquo;. All the sounds together will create a peculiar collective sound, is it not a fact? Will you hear &ldquo;potato&rdquo; or &ldquo;beans&rdquo; or &ldquo;cauliflower&rdquo; from a distance? No, you hear the collective sound &ldquo;hawawawawa&rdquo;. Is it not a fact? Similarly, all those sounds, innumerable sounds, brought under the broad category of fifty, will create a collective sound in the universe. That collective sound is aum, A-U-M.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Now listen to these three sounds of aum: a, u, ma. They represent the creation, the retention [or preservation], and the destruction. The first sound, a, represents creation; the second sound, u, represents retention; the third sound, ma, represents destruction. So all those innumerable sounds, all those fifty sounds, are represented by these supreme sounds, a, u and ma; and collectively a-u-ma becomes aum. For each and every action there is a supporting sound in this universe. That supporting sound is called the acoustic root of that action.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->You are moving. The sound khat&#x301;-khat&#x301;-khat&#x301;-khat&#x301; is created. That sound, khat&#x301;-khat&#x301;-khat&#x301;, is the acoustic root of the action of moving.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->You are laughing. The sound ha&#x301;-ha&#x301;-ha&#x301;-ha&#x301; is created. The sound ha&#x301;-ha&#x301;-ha&#x301; is the acoustic root of the action of laughing. Each and every action has its acoustic root.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->The portion of the tree that remains under the earth is the root; the acoustic root is the sound which may be treated as the rudimental portion of an action. The Latin adjective of &ldquo;root&rdquo; is &ldquo;rudimental&rdquo;. For each and every action of this world there is an acoustic root.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->You see, tantra. The root tan means &ldquo;to expand&rdquo;, and tra means &ldquo;liberator&rdquo;. The science that liberates you from all bondages, physical, mental and spiritual, is Tantra. Tan means &ldquo;expansion&rdquo; and tra means &ldquo;liberator&rdquo;. The science that expands your mind and spirit and thus liberates you is Tantra. The metamorphosed form of tantra about seven thousand years ago became taota. The Sanskrit dhya&#x301;na became c&#146;han [in Chinese], c&#146;han became chen [in Korean], chen became zen [in Japanese]. It is a very interesting science. Now, tantra became taota; taota after further distortion, further metamorphosis, became taoa &ndash; in modern language [Chinese], tao. Taoism, don&#146;t you know? Its root is tantra. Do you relish this topic? Do you like what I am saying? But I must be paid for it! [Everybody laughs.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->So then for all the universe, the acoustic side is aum &ndash; A-U-M. It includes all the spheres of work also. It is the collective sound of all the work of the universe.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->The earth moves around the sun; certainly a sound is created. It may or may not be audible to you, you may or may not hear it, but certainly a sound is created. The moon moves around the [earth]; certainly waves are created, and certainly due to those waves, sounds are also created. It may or may not be audible to you. Everywhere there is sound. If you move stealthily, as the cat moves while catching a mouse, even then there is sound. Everywhere there is wave; everywhere there is light also. That light may or may not be visible to you.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->In the night you cannot see, but owls can see, moles can see &ndash; Moles, you know? Rat-like creatures of small size&#8230; for example, &ldquo;to make a mountain out of a molehill&rdquo;. Moles can see in the night. Owls can see in the night. Bats can see in the night. The bat is neither bird nor animal, it is a mammal. It lays no eggs; it is a mammal. It can see in the night, so there is light. Aum is the collection of all sounds, so within the scope of aum come all the activities of the world. For each and every work there is sound; aum is the collection of all sounds. So within the scope of aum comes all the work of the world. Aum represents the mundane expression of Parama Purus&#x301;a; aum represents the worldly expression of Parama Purus&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->In each and every human being there is sleeping divinity, divinity in latent form, divinity in dormant form. When that sleeping divinity is aroused, stops sleeping, is in a wakeful stage, what happens? A person will acquire immense power. He or she may become omniscient, all-knowing &ndash; will know everything, without going through any book, without going to any library &ndash; will know everything of this universe, because that person will be one with Parama Purus&#x301;a. The person is  Parama Purus&#x301;a, because the sleeping divinity has been aroused.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->The sleeping divinity in the human body lies in the lowermost portion of your backbone. That lowermost bone is called kula in Sanskrit. That sleeping divinity is called kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii. Kun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii means &ldquo;in coiled form&rdquo;.

Every vibration also represents a particular idea, and hence each idea has a vibrational sound and vibrational colour. Many vibrational waves are too long or too short to be perceived by human beings - we cannot hear their sound or see their colour &ndash; but they do exist. We can speak of them as causal matrices in the realm of vibrational colour; and consider them as the biija mantras [acoustic roots] of the ideas with which they are concerned.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="12..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Although a indirectly controls the seven musical notes, it chiefly controls the first note, s&#x301;ad&#x301;aja. This note is represented in the surasaptaka or sargam [gamut of notes] by its initial letter, sya. Remember that in the vilambita [prolonged] technique of pronunciation of this note, the vowel sound a&#x301; is not employed;<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.12.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#12.fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> rather the sam&#x301;vrta [lengthened]<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.12.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#12.fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  pronunciation of a is employed. That is, the vowel here will not be pronounced a&#x301;-a&#x301;-a&#x301;-a&#x301;-a&#x301;-a&#x301;-a&#x301;-a&#x301;, but will be pronounced somewhat like aya, as they do in northern India. (More precisely, the pronunciation will be intermediate between aya and a&#x301;). If singers were to pay more attention to proper pronunciation, they would benefit.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->As the sound a is the acoustic root of the note s&#x301;ad&#x301;aja, the letter a is the first step in the learning of music. In Occidental music, the octave (do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do) has evolved in a similar way.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->The difference between Occidental and Oriental music is that in the former the first note, s&#x301;ad&#x301;aja [or &ldquo;do&rdquo;], is repeated at the end to form an octave. Thus in Oriental music we say surasaptaka or musical &ldquo;septave&rdquo;  (&ldquo;collection of seven notes&rdquo;) whereas in Occidental music we say &ldquo;octave&rdquo; (&ldquo;collection of eight notes&rdquo;).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Sada&#x301;shiva arranged sounds in the form of the surasaptaka, which contributed on the one hand to the acoustics of science, and on the other hand to the rhythmic phonetics of music. Hence in the study of music we cannot afford to forget his unique contribution.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->A little while ago I said that every sound has colour too. Alternative words for ram&#x301; [&ldquo;colour&rdquo;] are varn&#x301;a [which also means &ldquo;letter&rdquo;] and ra&#x301;ga. The word ra&#x301;ga is derived from the root-verb ran&#x301;j plus the suffix ghain&#x32D;, and means &ldquo;to colour&rdquo; something. By permutating and combining different sounds, Shiva created various ra&#x301;gas and arranged them in a perfect orderly sequence. In this way He created six ra&#x301;gas and thirty-six ra&#x301;giniis. This was an immense contribution to the world of music and earned him the epithet Na&#x301;datanu [Embodiment of Divine Sound] in the Vedas. Of course it was Mahars&#x301;i Bharata who popularized these ra&#x301;gas and ra&#x301;giniis amongst intellectuals.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->These ra&#x301;gas and ra&#x301;giniis are subject to changes according to the shortening or lengthening of their notes. Following this system, Indian music is divided into two main branches: northern Indian music (colloquially &ldquo;Hindustani music&rdquo;), which is popular to the north of the Vindhya Hills, and Deccan music (or &ldquo;Karnatak music&rdquo;), which is popular to the south of the Vindhya Hills. Many new ra&#x301;gas and ra&#x301;giniis are being evolved today and will be evolved in the future. There can be no end to this process of evolution. In Prabha&#x301;ta Sam&#x301;giita<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.12.fn5"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#12.fn5">5</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> also, a few new ra&#x301;gas and ra&#x301;giniis have been evolved, but they have not yet been given names.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="12..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->The sound a&#x301; is the acoustic root of rs&#x301;abha, the second musical note. This acoustic root directly controls rs&#x301;abha and indirectly controls ga&#x301;ndha&#x301;ra (ga&#x301;), madhyama (ma&#x301;), pain&#x32D;cama (pa&#x301;), dhaevata (dha&#x301;) and nis&#x301;a&#x301;da (ni). In the Vedas other than the Rgveda, we usually come across komala [soft] ni and sa&#x301;dha&#x301;ran&#x301;a [ordinary] ni. In the older portions of the Rgveda, kad&#x301;ii [hard or high-pitched] ni was used. It could be uttered with both sides of the uvula. The seven Vedic and Tantric notes, the seven Vedic metres and the two bha&#x301;va&#x301;tmaka svara [spiritual sounds] constitute the sixteen prominent sounds which in Indo-Aryan phonetics are known as s&#x301;od&#x301;asha dhvanikala&#x301; [the &ldquo;sixteen sounds&rdquo; of Brahmavidya&#x301; &ndash; intuitional science &ndash; and gandharvavidya&#x301; &ndash; the science of music]. These musical notes were used in music and incantation in different combinations according to the waxing and waning of the moon and according to the time of day or night. Accordingly, a specific period of the month and time of the day was fixed for the performance of each ra&#x301;ga and ra&#x301;ginii.<!-- /block --></p>

It directly controls ga&#x301;ndha&#x301;ra and indirectly controls madhyama (ma&#x301;), pain&#x32D;cama (pa&#x301;), dhaevata (dha&#x301;) and nis&#x301;a&#x301;da (ni).<!-- /block --></p>

A sa sound occurring in any root-verb after the prefix ni may be changed into the letter s&#x301;a, that is, nisa&#x301;da and nis&#x301;a&#x301;da are both permissible. Similarly, upanis&#x301;ad and upanisad are equally correct. But in Bengali there is a convention of using s&#x301;a in such spellings.

<a name="12..30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->It should be remembered that vina&#x301;sha does not mean complete annihilation, but transformation or metamorphosis. Complete annihilation is called prana&#x301;sha. (In fact, nothing in this physical universe is subject to prana&#x301;sha or complete annihilation. But philosophically, prana&#x301;sha means that change which takes an entity back to its original form. If sugar made from sugar cane is transformed back into sugar cane, that will be the prana&#x301;sha of the sugar.

Apara&#x301;shakti is by no means insignificant &ndash; it helps microcosms to maintain their existence and achieve greater evolution and elevation. But the energy with which microcosms direct their physico-psycho-spiritual efforts towards the divine and reach the highest rung of the evolutionary ladder by piercing every tender layer of microcosmic existence, is called para&#x301;shakti (this para&#x301;shakti, which is the primordial phase of vocalization, is not the same as the para&#x301;shakti or Supreme Operative Principle in the unbalanced triangle of forces). Here we are concerned with the ways of expression of language. All the potentialities of vocal expression lie dormant in the form of para&#x301;shakti at the mu&#x301;la&#x301;dha&#x301;ra cakra. Para&#x301;shakti is raised step by step and finally leads to the vocal expression of language.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..54"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=54 type=paragraph -->If vocalization remains dormant in seed form at the mu&#x301;la&#x301;dha&#x301;ra, it is neither audible nor perceivable in the practical world. The latent para&#x301;shakti has got to be awakened. Human beings visualize whatever they want to communicate, sometimes only for a fraction of a second, consciously or unconsciously. If they are already aware of the name and form of the visualized object, they can progress further in the process of expression, otherwise that name or form will continue to remain in the abstract world. This stage, in which one can mentally visualize what one is going to communicate, is the second stage in the process of vocalization. Its controlling point is the sva&#x301;dhis&#x301;t&#x301;ha&#x301;na cakra. The energy which causes the visualization is called pashyanti.

This is the second stage of vocalization. Of course just to visualize the perceived object (with the help of pashyanti shakti) is not enough; other people cannot see your mental images or mental words, because those things belong to the psychic world. Linguistic expression pertains to the mundane world. Words are transmitted in the outer world through the medium of air or electro-magnetic waves, or some such medium.

Thieves, in the shock of the moment, always make a quick getaway from the scene of the crime.

This is called a&#x301;dha&#x301;ragata moha [fascination for an object]. There are many rich people who have a strange weakness for some old, battered object such as a rickety chair with one arm broken off.

<p class=footnotes_title>Footnotes</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="12.fn1"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.12.fn1">1</a></b>)   Editors&#146; note: Each of the notes is represented by a single syllable, just as in Western music the notes are represented by do-re-mi. But each of the notes is further represented by an animal associated with its syllable.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="12.fn2"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.12.fn2">2</a></b>)   Editors&#146; note: The Indo-Aryan alphabet is divided into vargas, &ldquo;groups&rdquo;, of phonetically-related sounds. The ka varga, for example (whose second consonant is kha), consists of sounds produced in the throat (gutturals).</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="12.fn3"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.12.fn3">3</a></b>)  Editors&#146; note: According to normal Sanskrit grammar, if a is followed by a, the two combine to become a&#x301;.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="12.fn4"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.12.fn4">4</a></b>)   Editors&#146; note: Of the three pronunciations used in Indian song to which the author refers, the sam&#x301;vrta is slightly prolonged, the vilambita is more prolonged, and the pluta is most prolonged.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="12.fn5"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.12.fn5">5</a></b>)  Editors&#146; note: 5018 songs composed by the author.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="12.fn6"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.12.fn6">6</a></b>)  Editors&#146; note: As indicated earlier, the Rgvedic pronunciation s&#x301;a has a corresponding Yajurvedic pronunciation kha.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="12.fn7"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.12.fn7">7</a></b>)   Editors&#146; note: In spite of the fact that it is grouped with the vowels, and that in speech people find it difficult to pronounce without giving it some vowel sound.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="12.fn8"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.12.fn8">8</a></b>)   Editors&#146; note: In cases where it is converted to ra, such as when the noun rs&#x301;i becomes the adjective a&#x301;rs&#x301;a.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="12.fn9"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.12.fn9">9</a></b>)  Editors&#146; note: The combination of the two &ndash; dot plus crescent - is paralleled in Roman Sanskrit by the letter &ldquo;n&#x32D;&rdquo;. Either the Bengali/Devanagari or the Roman version represents, so far as phonetics is concerned, a nasalization of the vowel it is associated with. Note also that m becomes m&#x301; for euphony when followed by a consonant, such as in on&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="12.fn10"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.12.fn10">10</a></b>)  Editors&#146; note: A royal ceremony in which a king would expect to be accepted as sovereign king.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="12.fn11"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.12.fn11">11</a></b>)  Author&#146;s note: As the navel area is the controlling point of the luminous factor, it is not easily burnt. It is only with the application of tremendous heat that it can be burnt to ashes. A funeral pyre does not generate sufficient heat to burn the navel area. So those who cremate their loved ones retrieve this unburnt portion from the ashes and immerse it in any holy river. This practice is popularly known as asthivisarjana.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="12.fn12"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.12.fn12">12</a></b>)  Author&#146;s note: Just as the root-verb cal [move] plus suffix shatr equals calat [that which is in motion], cal plus sha&#x301;nac equals calama&#x301;na.<br> The root-verb cal is ubhayapadii [both a&#x301;tmanepadii and parasmaepadii &ndash; terminologies of conjugation in ancient Sanskrit]. In the early part of the Vedic age it was mainly used in the a&#x301;tmanepadii form, but later on began to be used in the parasmaepadii form. In modern Sanskrit, it is used in the parasmaepadii form. Only in a few rare cases is the a&#x301;tmanepadii form used, as in the following example, a well-known utterance of Lord Buddha:<br> <br> Iha&#x301;sane shus&#x301;yatu me shariiram.<br> Tvagasthima&#x301;m&#x301;sam&#x301; pralayanca ya&#x301;tu.<br> Apra&#x301;pya bodhim&#x301; bahukalpadurlabha&#x301;m<br> Naeva&#x301;sana&#x301;t ka&#x301;yamatashcalis&#x301;yate.<br> <br> [Until I attain the highest realization, which is rare even in hundreds of lives, I will not budge an inch from this posture, even if my skin, flesh and bones dry up and my body perishes.]<br> <br> Dyotama&#x301;na&#x301; is a sha&#x301;nac-ending word. Since olden days, the a&#x301;tmanepadii form dyotate has been used.<br> <br> Dyotate kriid&#x301;ate yasma&#x301;dudyate dyotate divi;<br> Tasma&#x301;ddeva iti proktah stu&#x301;yate sarvadevataeh.<br> <br> [The vibrational manifestations emanating from the Supreme Nucleus are known as devata&#x301;s, and these devata&#x301;s address that Supreme Nucleus as Deva. He with His powers vibrates the entire universe, makes the entire universe dance; and He by dint of His occult and supra-occult powers brings everything back onto His lap.]</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="12.fn13"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.12.fn13">13</a></b>)  Author&#146;s note: Mrga literally means &ldquo;wild animal&rdquo;, and thus both a deer and a tiger are equally mrga. Hence literally mrgacarma means not only &ldquo;deerskin&rdquo;, but the skin of any wild animal. In those days the kings hunted not only deer, but also other wild animals. <br> Later on, perhaps, the deerskin became somewhat rare, so people introduced the use of cotton in its place. Even today in certain sections of Indian society people wear a piece of deerskin during the holy-thread ceremony.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="12.fn14"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.12.fn14">14</a></b>)  Editors&#146; note: This straight posture symbolizes that although one may or may not be straight in all mundane activities, one is as simple and straight as can be before the entity being revered.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="12.fn15"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.12.fn15">15</a></b>)  Author&#146;s note: Dance should not be called shilpa &ndash; literally, &ldquo;that which is done with the hands&rdquo; &ndash; because in dance, the legs, neck, chin and other parts of the body are also used. In some dances every part of the body has a certain role to play.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="12.fn16"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.12.fn16">16</a></b>)   Editors&#146; note: Philology of &ldquo;oriental&rdquo;, &ldquo;occidental&rdquo;, and other words omitted here.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="12.fn17"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.12.fn17">17</a></b>)  Editors&#146; note: Not only am&#x301; and ah, but all sixteen vowel sounds, are located at the vishuddha cakra. For correlation of other sounds with their respective cakras, see &ldquo;Plexi and Microvita&rdquo;  in Yoga Psychology.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="12.fn18"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.12.fn18">18</a></b>)  Editors&#146; note: In Ananda Marga sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, shuddhis (visualizations for withdrawing the mind) and Guru Pu&#x301;ja&#x301;.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="12.fn19"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.12.fn19">19</a></b>)  Editors&#146; note: The lokas of the Macrocosmic Mind are Its different &ldquo;levels&rdquo;, or &ldquo;layers&rdquo;, or &ldquo;spheres&rdquo;. They represent different stages on a continuum from subtle to crude. And the ka&#x301;mamaya kos&#x301;a represents such a stage in both the Macrocosmic Mind and the microcosmic mind. The ka&#x301;mamaya kos&#x301;a of the microcosm is its &ldquo;crude mind&rdquo;, as it is the layer of mind closest to the physical body. It is concerned with physical sensations and physical desires.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="12.fn20"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.12.fn20">20</a></b>)  Editors&#146; note: The lokas of the Macrocosmic Mind are Its different &ldquo;levels&rdquo;, or &ldquo;layers&rdquo;, or &ldquo;spheres&rdquo;.

<a name="13..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->This human body is controlled by nerve fibres, which in turn are controlled by nerve cells. The human body generally moves as it is directed to by the mind. But when the body functions under the impact of certain inborn instincts, it does not require direction by the mind. Such actions are absolutely physical or mundane. Then there are some functions which, though physical, are also related to the mind, such as hunger, thirst, sleep and drowsiness. The latter functions are regulated by the ten va&#x301;yus [vital-energy flows] &ndash; pra&#x301;n&#x301;a, apa&#x301;n&#x301;a, sama&#x301;na, uda&#x301;na, vya&#x301;na (the five [internal] va&#x301;yus), and na&#x301;ga, ku&#x301;rma, krkara, devadatta and dhanain&#x32D;jaya (the five [external] va&#x301;yus). Through these external va&#x301;yus all kinds of natural functions are performed. The mind does not play any particular role in these cases.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->All other functions, however, are controlled by the mind. The mind will send instructions to the body according to how it (the mind) is controlled or regulated by physico-psycho-spiritual practices; and in order to control the mind the ten va&#x301;yus have to be brought under control. The systematic and scientific process to regulate the va&#x301;yus in order to control the mind is called pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;ya&#x301;ma. Pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;n yamayatyes&#x301;ah pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;ya&#x301;mah  &ndash;  &ldquo;The process of controlling the va&#x301;yus is known as pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;ya&#x301;ma.&rdquo; (The word pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;ya&#x301;ma is derived as: [pra&#x301;n&#x301; + a&#x301; &ndash; yam + ghain&#x32D;].)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->There is a unique causal relationship between the functioning of the va&#x301;yus and the functioning of the mind. If someone keeps running at a certain pace by drawing rapidly on accumulated vital energy, the person&#146;s respiration becomes faster, and if the respiration becomes fast, one loses the capacity for deep thinking or deep contemplation. That is, one loses the capacity to think, or to assimilate or internalize any idea through the organs, in a calm and systematic way. [[If the mind is restless, the body will also be restless, and if the body is restless, the mind will also be restless.]] That is why during spiritual practice, the body should be kept motionless. One must practise seated in a certain posture, because if the body becomes calm and motionless the mind also tends to become calm and concentrated. If someone is constantly thinking that he or she will have to sit down at a certain time, stand up at a certain time, catch hold of one&#146;s nose or ears at a certain time, the mind will automatically tend to become restless. Such is the intimate relation between the body and the mind.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="13..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->This sort of functioning of the mind is discharged in and through the body with the help of the nerve cells and nerve fibres. Its principle controlling centre is situated in the sahasra&#x301;ra cakra &ndash; the pineal gland &ndash; but its substations are located in various parts of the body.  The substations are located in sites of the body from which particular kinds of thought-waves control the adjacent areas of the body in their own respective ways. These substations are called cakra or padma or kamala &ndash; plexus in Latin &ndash; thus we have the various cakras &ndash; mu&#x301;la&#x301;dha&#x301;ra, sva&#x301;dhis&#x301;t&#x301;ha&#x301;na, man&#x301;ipura, ana&#x301;hata, vishuddha, a&#x301;jin&#x32D;a&#x301;, etc. The mind, instead of exerting its control directly from the sahasra&#x301;ra cakra, exerts its control through the other cakras, the other plexi. Hence in order to advance spiritually, one has first to establish control over these lower cakras, then finally over the sahasra&#x301;ra cakra. If one, conversely, tries to control the sahasra&#x301;ra first while the other cakras remain uncontrolled, spiritual practice on the sahasra&#x301;ra may be hampered. Not only that; even if the sahasra&#x301;ra cakra can be brought under control, the final result will not be good if the subsidiary cakras are not brought under control. It is not enough that the driver of a car be efficient, the car as well must be free from any defect.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->The various cakras are controlled by particular biija mantras, particular acoustic roots, and also emanate sound vibrations; and every sound vibration coming from each such plexus &ndash; each such network of na&#x301;d&#x301;iis [psychic-energy channels] &ndash; is in scripture given the name of a particular devata&#x301; [deity], a particular vibrational existence. When you think in a particular way, your mind is vibrated in the corresponding way, and your nerve cells and nerve fibres are vibrated in the corresponding way. When someone gets angry, the mind also becomes heated and red, and there is a corresponding reaction in the nerves. The body becomes reddish and starts trembling. Now these devata&#x301;s or vibrational existences &ndash; each the repository of a particular kind of thinking and each representing one point in a given cakra &ndash; are controlled by the nuclei of their respective plexi, and all those nuclei are controlled by the human mind, which is the collective expression of fifty main propensities.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Those fifty main propensities function both internally and externally. One may donate something to someone both internally and externally. Likewise, one can steal both mentally and physically. Hence every propensity is functioning in two ways, and fifty times two equals one hundred. Furthermore, each propensity functions in ten directions [north, south, east, west, northeast, northwest, southeast, southwest, up and down]. One hundred times ten equals one thousand. Hence there are one thousand functioning propensities. These one thousand vrttis are controlled by the mind from the pineal gland, which is why [its corresponding cakra] is called sahasra&#x301;ra [sahasra means &ldquo;thousand&rdquo;]. So the nucleus of the sahasra&#x301;ra controls the sahasra&#x301;ra itself, every subsidiary plexus below the pineal gland, and the vrtti-controlling points of all those cakras. (Each of these points is a vibrational existence, a devata&#x301;.) All the devata&#x301;s of a given plexus are controlled by the controlling point of that plexus, and the supreme controlling point is the controlling point of the pineal gland. This supreme controlling point is called Paramashiva in yoga philosophy &ndash; Paramashivah Purus&#x301;ottamah vishvasya kendram [&ldquo;Supreme Consciousness at the nucleus of the universe is known as Paramashiva or Purus&#x301;ottama&rdquo;]. The same entity which is called Paramashiva or Purus&#x301;ottama in Ra&#x301;ja Yoga is known as &ldquo;Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&rdquo; in Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava Tantra. This is one aspect [of the Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a concept in philosophy]. This is a very important point which should be well understood.<!-- /block --></p>

I have told you that in Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava Tantra the last bone of the vertebral column is called kula. [Here resides the serpentine coil.] In Tantra it is called kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii, while in Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava Tantra it is called &ldquo;Ra&#x301;dha&#x301;&rdquo;, and Paramashiva [Purus&#x301;ottama] is called &ldquo;Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&rdquo;. Through sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; we raise the kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii upwards, and in the end the union of Ra&#x301;dha&#x301; and Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a takes place. There is a secret technique to raise this serpentine coil. Previously this technique was not clearly given. At that time some people thought it proper to keep it secret. If something harmful to individual or collective life is not given, that is good; but the useful things have to be given. People will be more attracted to do sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>

Just below the sahasra&#x301;ra cakra is the guru cakra. When one meditates at the guru cakra, the kun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii takes one jump upwards, and the mind goes to the other side of the cakra [i.e., to the sahasra&#x301;ra.] This is the technique of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, but it has previously neither been explained nor written in books.<!-- /block --></p>

Sometimes one first hears the sound of rumbling clouds, sometimes ankle bells, sometimes the roar of the sea. When after hearing different sounds in this way the mind reaches the trikut&#x301;i, one hears the sweet and harmonious sound of the flute. These are various expressions of the pran&#x301;ava sound. The pran&#x301;ava sound is heard as the trikut&#x301;i or a&#x301;jin&#x32D;a&#x301; cakra is crossed, but then when the mind merges with Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a or Paramashiva there is no sound, the silence itself is the sound.  There is no expression. These are some of the secrets of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;.

A&#x301;dhibhaotika suffering is mundane, that is, it derives from shortages of food, clothing, medicine, education, shelter, etc. If we change the structure of society this misery will be ended. So we must do this, we should do this. Regarding a&#x301;dhidaevika suffering &ndash; if we prepare our minds through sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, all the mental cares and worries that result from a defective mental structure will come to an end.

He is in the sahasra&#x301;ra cakra, the pineal gland. And the sleeping jiivashakti is in the lowest cakra, the mu&#x301;la&#x301;dha&#x301;ra cakra. This feeling of separation is a&#x301;dhya&#x301;tmika suffering.

He will create a body for Himself with the help of the five fundamental factors, and He will come. He will say, &ldquo;I will awaken the pra&#x301;n&#x301;a [vital energy] of these dying people with a timely slap, I will stir up their pra&#x301;n&#x301;a.&rdquo; He will create vibrations in their pra&#x301;n&#x301;a. He will not tolerate idleness. He will not allow us to waste this valuable human life.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->When He comes, after creating His own body with the help of the five fundamental factors &ndash; solid, liquid, luminous, aerial and ethereal &ndash; to create an ideological tidal wave, that stage is called Maha&#x301;sambhu&#x301;ti. Maha&#x301; means &ldquo;great&rdquo;, &ldquo;having a form which is supra-natural&rdquo;. And bhu&#x301; plus ktin equals bhu&#x301;ti. Hence Maha&#x301;sambhu&#x301;ti means &ldquo;The Great Creation&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Great Appearance&rdquo;. Whenever in the past Parama Purus&#x301;a thought it necessary, He came in the form of Maha&#x301;sambhu&#x301;ti. In that way came Sada&#x301;shiva, in that way came Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. To push human society forward, to resuscitate the half-dead human race, to awaken society, they came. They came to create a wave in the field of ideology, in the social field and in the field of humanity; they came to create a tidal wave in every dimension and on every level. They delivered hammer blows to the various human social structures of the world. For this they received both the highest praise and the most scathing condemnation.<!-- /block --></p>

<div class=book_chapter_title>Tantra and Indo-Aryan Civilization</div>

<div class=book_chapter_info_top></div>

<a name="15..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The Aryans were not the original inhabitants of the present India. When the Aryans entered India through the Northwest Frontier Province, they contemptuously called the indigenous population whom they defeated in battle, &ldquo;Ana&#x301;ryas&rdquo; [&ldquo;Non-Aryans&rdquo;]. The appellation &ldquo;Ana&#x301;ryas&rdquo; did not apply to any group in particular, but rather to all the then inhabitants of India in general: the Mongolians, the Austrics and the Dravidians (a mixture of Austric and Negro). My discourse today will give a brief overview of the transformation that occurred in the civilizations of these peoples after the arrival of the Aryans, and of the effect that the Aryan migration had on the Aryans themselves. I will try to concentrate particularly upon the influence of Tantra on the Aryans.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The original home of the Aryans was in the northern part of Central Asia. By descent they were a fair, tall and healthy race. They were people of nomadic nature whose main means of subsistence was hunting. When, however, it became impossible for them to procure enough food by hunting, they started rearing cattle. But the merciless nature of Central Asia made their lives unbearable: snowstorms diminished the numbers both of their people and of their animals, and there was a chronic shortage of animal fodder. Just to survive, they had to spend almost all their time collecting food. Not only did this acute food shortage force them to make unending efforts as a group to collect food and rear cattle, it also led to perpetual inter-group skirmishes and even slaughter.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The constant fighting during this period, this ks&#x301;atriya-dominated era, led to the eventual emergence of a class of intellectuals who greatly assisted the ks&#x301;atriya-dominated society. They provided the ks&#x301;atriya leaders with new inventions and discoveries, and satisfied their mental hunger by sharing their knowledge and wisdom. In the language of the day, these intellectuals were called rs&#x301;is. The group leaders bowed their heads in reverence before these mighty intellectuals and followed the precepts framed by them. The society used to call their ideology A&#x301;rs&#x301;a Dharma [Religion of the Sages].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->There can be no doubt that these rs&#x301;is were wiser and more intelligent than the people of the time. But as script had not yet been invented, there was no means to keep a record of the wise discourses given by the rs&#x301;is. The rs&#x301;is&#146; disciples had no choice but to learn the rs&#x301;is&#146; discourses by heart as they were being spoken. Since the discourses were memorized upon being heard, they were called shruti [literally, &ldquo;ear&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The level of intelligence of the Aryan mass at that time was so low that it hardly merits any mention. Actually, they were unable to understand these profound discourses, and as a consequence called them veda, meaning &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo;. They believed that the innovative rs&#x301;is and intellectual munis were not men of ordinary stuff, but superior beings who heard the words of wisdom directly from the mouths of the gods. They also called them dras&#x301;t&#x301;a [seers], as they &ldquo;saw&rdquo; with their own eyes the supernatural phenomena that they talked about, and uttered with their own mouths the benign incantations and mantras which produced those phenomena. Thus, every composer of the Vedic mantras was called a seer, and not a writer or composer. Generally, people believed that the composers of the Vedas were not men but veritable gods.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Even though the Vedas were considered as the creations of God and as such infallible, theism or spirituality was not fully awakened among the Aryans of that time. They only sang hymns and eulogies to appease the different natural forces.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->In that age of undeveloped science they thought that smoke and the clouds in the sky were the same thing. That was why they burned ghee in sacrificial fires: they wanted to make smoke out of it to propitiate the different gods. They believed that the smoke would soar into the sky and turn into clouds; that rain would pour down from the clouds and nourish the earth causing an abundance of trees, plants and grass to sprout forth; and that their domestic animals, strengthened by the fresh grass, would multiply. That was why yajin&#x32D;as [sacrifices] were very common among the different groups and tribes. Those simple people believed that some gods would be propitiated by ghee, some by wine, and some by animal blood.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Human nature is such that one thinks that what is dear to oneself must be dear to everybody. So the ghee-, meat- and wine-loving Aryans thought that such food items would be liked by the gods also. Thus, after each inter-clan war, the chief of the conquering clan would offer that clan&#146;s favourite food to the gods, either in Ashvamedha Yajin&#x32D;a [Horse Sacrifice] or in Gomedha Yajin&#x32D;a [Cow Sacrifice] or in Ra&#x301;jasu&#x301;ya Yajin&#x32D;a [sacrifice performed by a sovereign ruler], etc.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Each of the gods and goddesses of the polytheistic Aryans had his or her individual nature, characteristics and va&#x301;hana [mount]. Although they were polytheists and nature-worshippers, they did not worship idols, not because they understood the philosophical defects of idol-worship, but because they lacked the refined artistic sense necessary to make the idols.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->All their gods and goddesses were laokik figures [creations of the people]. They arose out of the peoples&#146; worldly needs. Hence the storm, the thunder, the lightning, the rain, the sun, and the moon were all their gods. In that era of undeveloped science what they feared most was the darkness of night, so they not only regarded the night and the evening as their gods, they actually revered them as well. In their fear, they would try to escape from the darkness by making fire with flint. They would never dare to displease the night and the evening, so whenever they made a fire they would first make obeisance to the evening with the fire before doing anything else. At night&#146;s end, when the eastern horizon glowed red, the Aryans would sing the song of the dawn in unison. Arun&#x301;a, the mythological charioteer of the sun&#146;s seven-horsed chariot (the seven horses corresponding to the seven distinct colours of the sun&#146;s rays), was also their god, as, indeed, was the sun itself.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Some of the rs&#x301;is understood, however, in a vague way if not in a clear way, the truth that there was a Supreme Entity above these gods, a Supreme Controller &ndash; the fundamental power of all their powers. This God of gods was the rs&#x301;is&#146; Brahma. The common people were not familiar with the word Brahma.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->The kings or chieftains staged sacrifices with great pomp and ostentation to appease the gods. The common people used these occasions for boisterous revelry. Since they lived in cold countries, of course, wine and meat were not particularly harmful to them. They would often entertain their guests with meat-cakes and wine. The children were given honey instead of wine. In the Aryan language of that time, wine was often called &ldquo;honey&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->The oldest portion of the Vedas, that is, the Rgveda, was composed outside India. The remaining portions, that is, the Yajurveda and Atharvaveda, were partly Indian and partly non-Indian. Sa&#x301;maveda is not a separate Veda by itself but is the compilation of the lyrical and musical portions of the different Vedas. So only the Rgveda can be regarded as an ancient relic of the non-Indian Aryan civilization. The Yajurveda was composed in Iran, Afghanistan, northwest India and certain parts of what is modern Russia, so it cannot be called entirely non-Indian, particularly since the then Afghanistan (Ga&#x301;ndha&#x301;r) and certain parts of Russia were regarded as part of India at that time.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->The original Rgvedic civilization belonged, in spirit and language, to the non-Indian Aryans. But the Yajurveda was composed by a particular branch of the Vedic Aryans who, when the Aryans later began to spread out in search of food (especially wheat), migrated to India via Iran (A&#x301;ryan&#x301;ya Vraja) and Afghanistan. When we say &ldquo;Indo-Aryan civilization&rdquo;, we basically mean the civilization of these people.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->These nomadic Aryans, on coming in contact with the different groups of people of Iran, Afghanistan and northwest India, took up farming and developed the techniques of strategic warfare. The impact of this new thought bred in them, to some extent, a refined intelligence.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->In the beginning, during the Rgvedic era, the cattle-rearing Aryans were only acquainted with barley and a few other crops. After they came to the present Iran they learned to cultivate wheat and, to some extent, rice. The more they progressed on their march, the more they came to realize the importance of growing different crops. Still, their staple was generally barley.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->They learned wheat cultivation from the Asuras, the primitive natives of Iran. Though they became acquainted with paddy, or briihi (briihi &rarr; riihi &rarr; rihi &rarr; risi &rarr; &ldquo;rice&rdquo;, as in modern English), they did not cultivate it extensively. They learned the use of boiled rice in India.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->The Yajurvedic era saw the all-round development of these people, and the resultant development of the Brahmava&#x301;da of the Yajurveda &ndash; the doctrine of monotheism. During this era not only was there a noticeable intellectual development among the general mass of the Aryans; among the munis [intellectuals or seers] and the rs&#x301;is, philosophy and spirituality also attained a brilliant height of expression. The Brahmava&#x301;da of the Yajurveda was a lot deeper and clearer than that of the Rgveda.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->The Atharvaveda was initially composed in India. During the composition of this Veda the Aryans came in close contact with the non-Aryans, resulting in an exchange of thought between the two. The Tantra of the non-Aryans had a marked influence on the Atharvaveda.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Being non-Aryan, the Atharvaveda cannot be regarded as a representation of Aryan civilization. In the subtle philosophy of the Atharvaveda, particularly of the Nrsim&#x301;ha Ta&#x301;pan&#x301;iiya Shruti, there is a far greater influence of the non-Aryan Tantra than of the Aryan Veda.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->The migrating Aryans first settled in the hilly valleys of northern India. Although there was not much intermixture of blood between the Aryans and the inhabitants of this area, the Aryans were greatly influenced by non-Aryan culture. The Aryans settled down in this area, which was known as Kash (or Khash) after defeating its ancient non-Aryan inhabitants. Using the original name, Kash, they renamed the area &ldquo;Kashmeru&rdquo; or &ldquo;Kashmiira&rdquo; [Kashmir]. Although the Aryans of Kashmiira did not give up their Vedic study, in the spiritual field they did cultivate the indigenous Indian Tantra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->As the southern part of Kashmiira was littered with pebbles resembling the jambu fruit [Eugenia jambolana Lam], the Aryans named it &ldquo;Jambu Dviipa&rdquo; (modern Jammu). Subsequently, Jambu Dviipa came to mean the whole of India. Possibly in the sandy beds of the many rivers that transect Jambu Dviipa they discovered gold for the first time, and so gold came to be known as ja&#x301;mbunada. When still later they settled throughout the entire land of India, they realized that it was ideal not only for habitation, but also for self-development. Thus they named it &ldquo;Bha&#x301;ratavars&#x301;a&rdquo;. Bhara means &ldquo;that which feeds&rdquo;; ta means &ldquo;that which gives&rdquo;, or &ldquo;that which helps in the process of expansion&rdquo;; and vars&#x301;a means &ldquo;a vast stretch of land&rdquo;. Thus, bha&#x301;ratavars&#x301;a means &ldquo;a vast expanse of land which helps in the all-round development of its inhabitants&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->The Aryans did not have their own script and thus were first introduced to the [written] alphabet after coming in contact with the Dravidians. The Dravidians of the Harappa and Mahenjodaro civilizations of India were already using a script, the Saendhavii script; after the Aryan migration into India, that script became transformed into the Bra&#x301;hmii and Kharos&#x301;t&#x301;hi scripts.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->The inconvenience that the non-Indian Aryans had faced for want of script no doubt disappeared after the Indianized Aryans learned it, but owing to their old superstitions, most of the Aryans were reluctant to put the Vedas in black and white. They refused to believe that the reason that the Vedas were not written at the time of their composition was simply the lack of script. They adhered to their illogical reasoning even after the scripts came into being: they thought that the rs&#x301;is had not written out the Vedas, one, because it was improper, and two, because the Vedas were named shruti. However, much later, in Kashmiira,<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.15.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#15.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> the Vedas were written down in the Sa&#x301;rada&#x301; script in use there at the time. There was really no alternative to writing them down, because there was almost nobody left who knew all the Vedas by heart, and the number of people who knew even parts of them was very small.  When the Kashmiira  scholars  finally did write down the Vedas, it was discovered that many parts of them were missing for good.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->It was not difficult for the healthy, martial, almost invincible Aryans to conquer northern India. The victorious Aryans treated the vanquished non-Aryans as slaves, trampling them underfoot to the bottom of their trivarn&#x301;a [three-caste] society &ndash; their society of Bra&#x301;hman&#x301;as, Ks&#x301;atriyas and Vaeshyas. There the non-Aryans became the fourth class, or Shu&#x301;dra Varn&#x301;a, while society became a ca&#x301;turvarn&#x301;a [four-caste] society. In the beginning the Aryans tried their utmost to avoid blood relationships with the Shu&#x301;dras &ndash; overwhelming proof of this is found in the Vedas and later books &ndash; but eventually it became impossible for them to avoid intermixture.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->Although in northern India the Aryans enjoyed predominance in the political sphere, the non-Aryans&#146; influence in the social sphere gradually increased, and persists even today. It was not possible for the Aryans to extend their political power into southern India. There they did exert some social influence, but even less than in the north.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->The courage, strength and physical beauty of the Aryans was conspicuous in the north, south and east of India, so in these areas, the non-Aryans were very eager to establish social relations with the Aryans, and often proudly called themselves A&#x301;rya-Vipras [Vipra = Bra&#x301;hman&#x301;a, or Brahman], A&#x301;rya-Ks&#x301;atriyas or A&#x301;rya-Vaeshyas. Although the Aryans&#146; predominance was mainly political, and the non-Aryans maintained social and cultural predominance, the Aryan influence over the language spread everywhere. Moreover, the influential leaders of society everywhere began to introduce themselves as Aryans. The anti-Aryan sentiment gradually weakened, causing a widespread inferiority complex to take root among the non-Aryan population. This inferiority complex proved extremely detrimental to the interests of the non-Aryans.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->The Aryan leader Agastya was the first to go to southern India to popularize the ideas and ideals of the Aryans. He explained the greatness of the Aryans to the people there allegorically. According to this mythological tale, Vindhya Hill on the northern frontier of the Deccan bent its head out of reverence for Agastya, enabling him to cross into southern India, and has kept its head bent in reverence ever since. The great epic Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a depicts the Aryan invasion of southern India. Needless to say, the monkeys of Kis&#x301;kindhya&#x301; and the ra&#x301;ks&#x301;asas [demons] of Lanka, as described in the Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a, were in fact neither monkeys nor demons, but the people of different sub-castes of the Dravidian society itself. The proof that the non-Aryans, particularly the Dravidians, were a highly developed community in regard to knowledge, learning, intellect, city and town building, cultivation of science, and social order and discipline, is traceable in every line of the Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a. It was extremely difficult for the Aryans to hold their own in an intellectual duel with the Dravidians. At every step they found themselves outwitted, and said, &ldquo;Queer are the ways of demons.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->As a result of co-existing with the non-Aryans for a long time, the Aryans learned many things from them. In fact there is hardly anything of Aryanism left in them today. Of course, the non-Aryans also took on certain Aryan traits, among them their fair complexion, their proficiency in various activities, and their ostentatious lifestyle. From the non-Aryans the Aryans acquired a well-knit social system, a subtle insight, spiritual philosophy and Tantra sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. In the beginning the Aryans tried hard to preserve the purity of their blood &ndash; Shu&#x301;dras used to be kept scrupulously at arm&#146;s length &ndash; but such endeavours and precautions eventually proved a failure. More or less everywhere in India there was intermixing between the Aryans and the non-Aryans &ndash; the Dravidians, the Austrics, and the Mongolians - which resulted in a new mixed race. This is why dark Vipras and fair Shu&#x301;dras are not at all rare in India today. Their very colours pay testimony to the intermixture of Aryan and non-Aryan blood running in their veins.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->The victorious Aryans, coming from cold countries, were a skilled and competent race. Their competence, their sense of superiority over the non-Aryans, and their unity born out of hatred for the non-Aryans, helped them in their victory over India. Though the non-Aryans were defeated by the Aryans in northern India, though the non-Aryans of southern and eastern India were under the spell of an inferiority complex, none of them surrendered to the Aryans without a fight. As they were constantly engaged in warfare with the Aryans, they became much more proficient in battle. Thus Aryan victory in southern and eastern India eventually became impossible. In the accounts of major battles fought between the Aryans and the non-Aryans, as depicted in the Sanskrit books written in the subsequent period,<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.15.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#15.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> the non-Aryans display no less competence than the Aryans.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->Aryan life was full of noisy revelry and pomp, whereas the non-Aryan life was simple and unostentatious, although it was the non-Aryans who had access to more materials of enjoyment. But when the non-Aryans came in contact with the Aryans, they became tempted to enjoy pomp and splendour. Such a lifestyle  proved more  harmful to the  comparatively inactive non-Aryans, inhabitants of a tropical country, than to the active and hardy Aryans.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->The Aryans outside India had no well-structured social system nor any clearly-defined marital discipline. &ldquo;Might is right&rdquo; was the order of society. Nevertheless there was a predisposition in them to mould a society. The non-Aryans had happy families. They were characterized by a well-knit social structure and strong conjugal relationships. Even those nature-worshipping ethnic groups forming part of the Austric population of non-Aryan society, though comparatively backward, had very strong family relationships. So when the Aryans came in contact with these non-Aryans, they found new light for the formation of a society.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->With the exception of a few munis and rs&#x301;is, the militant (ks&#x301;atriya-predominant) Aryans used to view the world with an extoversial outlook. After major battles they would kill the men of the conquered community, employ their children as servants, and either marry the women or employ them as maid-servants. For that reason there was a large number of male and female slaves in their society.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->War-loving races are generally careful to honour the rules and laws of war, and frame new laws to suit the convenience of warring armies. Thus, the Aryans displayed a commendable sense of discipline during war. Being a war-loving race, it was but natural for them to do so. The non-Aryans, however, were backward in this regard. During their battles with the Aryans they did not respect the rules and laws of war (such as not to strike at the defenceless, not to employ more than one fighter against another, not to kill a retreating or surrendering soldier or a soldier begging for mercy). Not only was this highly irritating to the Aryans; the lack of a disciplined military mentality was actually one of the main reasons for the non-Aryans&#146; defeat.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->Usually the non-Aryans were content with little. What was developed in them was their introspective nature, which not only made them devotees of God, but infused in them a surging love for spiritual philosophy. The religious practices of the Aryans, however, entailed performing certain sacrifices in order to attain certain materialistic gains. That is, their religious observances were mainly ritualistic. On the whole, the non-Aryans were followers of Tantra, or subjective sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. Of course the non-Aryans, depending on their different degrees of intellectual development, ranged all the way from animists to Brahma sa&#x301;dhakas [intuitional practitioners whose goal is the Absolute]; but in general, individual sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; ranked very high. The religion of the Vedic Aryans was, as a rule, one of prayer. It did not include even the subtlest hint of any intuitional meditation. And here lies the difference between the Brahmava&#x301;da of the Vedas and the Upanishads on the one hand, and that of Tantra on the other.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..36"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph -->As previously mentioned, by &ldquo;non-Aryans&rdquo; no particular ethnic group was meant. When the Aryans first migrated to India, the non-Aryans were, on the whole, divided into three populations. Of these, the Negro-Austric Dravidians were the most developed intellectually and spiritually. Their Tantra sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; bore a predominance of jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na and bhakti. The next groups deserving mention are those of the Mongolian population. In their Tantra sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, karma and bhakti were predominant. The groups which constituted the Austric population were almost equal to the Aryans intellectually, but in the practical and spiritual spheres they gradually lagged behind due to the comparative lack of dynamism of their society. This Austric society was content to practise the extroversial aspects of Tantra (witchcraft, invultuation, magic, magical incantation for evil purposes, hypnotism, etc.)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..37"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=37 type=paragraph -->Tantra flourished in Bengal due to the pervasive intermixture of Dravidian and Mongolian blood.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="15..40"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=40 type=paragraph -->Bengal was the home of both the Mongolian and the Dravidian populations, the Dravidians being more widespread in the southwestern areas and the Mongolians in the northeastern areas. Some groups of Austrics lived in the western parts. In the southeastern parts of Bengal, the Mongolians held an overwhelming majority over the Dravidians. The Chakmas, Tripuris, Bodos, Kochas, Kiratas, and Chuaras of the Mongolian population; the Kaevarttas, Bagdis, Dules, Shavaras, Kurmis, Mahatas, and Kherias of the Dravidian population; and the Santhaliis, Baoriis, Ma&#x301;la Pa&#x301;ha&#x301;riis [[(Ma&#x301;la or Ma&#x301;lo)]], etc., of the predominantly Austric population, were the original Bengalees.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..41"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=41 type=paragraph -->The present Bengali society and civilization are the outcome of the mutual exchange of thought among these peoples. The greatest contribution of this civilization has been the well-structured and well-disciplined Tantra sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. Tantra wields the greatest influence over the customs and usages of modern Bengal and eastern India. As a matter of fact, Tantra has had a more pervasive influence throughout all of India than have the Vedas, yet nowhere has this Tantric or non-Aryan influence been greater than in the eastern part of India. The iron bangles of the women, the vermilion mark in the parting of their hair, the various marriage customs and rites, etc., are all different social practices borrowed from the non-Aryans. The custom of addressing all women as &ldquo;mother&rdquo; (masiima&#x301;, pisiima&#x301;, ka&#x301;kiima&#x301; [aunts], didima&#x301; [grandmother], etc.) bears the mark of Tantric influence, because in Tantra the social dominance of women was widely accepted. Even the little non-Tantric or patrilineal influence that exists in the upper castes of Bengali society is not borrowed from the Aryans of northern India, but is a result of the close and intimate trans-oceanic relations that Bengal had in those days with regions outside India.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..42"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=42 type=paragraph -->In the life of Bengal, Tantra has surrendered to Veda only with respect to language. In fact there was no alternative but to acknowledge this defeat: The Bengalees of those days were followers of Tantra who spoke many different languages. When they decided to formulate a new language of their own, they were bound to accept the language of the foreign Aryans due to its highly expressive power. The Dravidian and Mongolian languages [although also a form of Sanskrit] were not so expressive as the Sanskrit language of the Vedas.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..43"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=43 type=paragraph -->Although the Aryan conquerors were unable to influence the social life of Bengal to any appreciable degree, due to their influence the Tantric matrilineal social system of Bengal (the Tantric matrilineal order prevails even today in the Dravid-Keralite and Mongolo-Khashian societies) partially accepted the patrilineal order as well. As a result Bengal, though not governed by the Mita&#x301;ks&#x301;ara&#x301;, or patrilineal, system of northern India, built up a new social order according due respect to both father and mother. Subsequently, in recognition of this new social system, Bengal officially rescinded the Mita&#x301;ks&#x301;ara&#x301; system [insofar as it officially existed], and in its place established the Da&#x301;yabha&#x301;ga<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.15.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#15.fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> system.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..44"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=44 type=paragraph -->The second result of the Aryan influence was the Bengali language. The language that the Bengalees of the Vedic era used to speak had no connection with the Vedic language. Neither could the Vedic Aryans understand it. The Aryans used to say, &ldquo;That is a country of birds. We don&#146;t understand what those birds chirp and twitter.&rdquo; Be that as it may, due the Vedic influence, particularly due to the influence of the eastern Vedic dialect, Ma&#x301;gadhii Pra&#x301;krta, there emerged a Sanskrit-based Aryan language in Bengal. Later on the Tantrics of this area composed Tantric literature using Sanskrit<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.15.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#15.fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> and the new Sanskrit-based Bengali.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..45"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=45 type=paragraph -->In spite of their accepting the Aryan language, the Tantrics never gave up their own style of pronunciation. Even today the Ma&#x301;gadhii group of languages, particularly the Eastern Demi-Ma&#x301;gadhii group (Bengali, Oriya, Assamese and Maethilii), has a style of pronunciation that is completely its own. In spite of later distortions in the mode of pronunciation in northern India, due to the non-cultivation of the Sanskrit language and the heavy use of Arabic- and Persian-influenced Urdu, eastern and southern India did not give up their ancient modes of pronunciation. In ancient times the people speaking Shaorasenii and Ma&#x301;lavii dialects used to make fun of the people speaking the Ma&#x301;gadhii dialect, which was heavily influenced by Tantra. Thus the people of the western part of the Ma&#x301;gadhii-speaking area, that is, the Magahii- and Bhojpuri-speaking people, tried to pronounce in the Shaorasenii style. Though there is, as a result, some influence of Shaorasenii and Hindi on the pronunciation of the Magahii and Bhojpuri dialects, the intonation of the sam&#x301;vrta<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.15.fn5"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#15.fn5">5</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> a has remained unchanged. The Tantric pronunciations of jin&#x32D;a, n&#x301;a, s&#x301;a, hya, and ks&#x301;a are also still prevalent in eastern India today.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..46"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=46 type=paragraph -->The Aryans had a developed language but no script. It was indeed the Tantrics, and not the Vedics, who invented script and acoustic science. So far as correctness of pronunciation is concerned, the Tantric mode is to be accepted, not the Vedic. Remember that each of the fifty letters of the Sanskrit aks&#x301;arama&#x301;la&#x301; [alphabet] constitutes one acoustic root of Tantra. It was for the purpose of spiritual practice that the Tantrics had discovered these roots. Here the Aryans deserve no credit at all.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..47"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=47 type=paragraph -->The Tantric influence exists in all the Indian languages;<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.15.fn6"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#15.fn6">6</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  it is also prominent in observances and ceremonies. The non-Aryan and Tantric influence is prominent not only in social functions, but in religious ceremonies as well, due to the influence of the Tantric gods and goddesses. In eastern India, particularly in Bengal, popular gods and goddesses such as Shiitala&#x301; (the goddess of smallpox), Manasa&#x301; (the goddess of snakes), Niila T&#x301;ha&#x301;kura and Bat&#x301;uka Bhaerava [a Buddhist Tantric deity] are all Tantric gods and goddesses but are nevertheless worshipped in Hindu temples as Hindu gods and goddesses.

<a name="15..48"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=48 type=paragraph -->Even the Satyana&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a of eastern India is a non-Aryan deity. Of course in this worship we also find some influence by the Muslims who came from the Arab world. Betels, plantains, areca nuts and coconuts [as used to worship Satyana&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a] are the main paraphernalia of non-Aryan worship, because they are Dravidian in origin. Perhaps the Vedic Aryans had never heard of these things, and perhaps there were no words for them in the Vedic language or in old Sanskrit. Words like na&#x301;gavallarii [a kind of creeping plant], kadalii [plaintain] and na&#x301;rikela [coconut] are modern Sanskrit, but these things are widely used in the worship of Satyana&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a and in other popular worship. Only the shirn&#x301;ii [food offered to a god] of the Muslims in the worship of Satyana&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a is imported.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..49"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=49 type=paragraph -->Sugar cane, coconut, limes, grapefruit, powdered rice, etc., used in the Chat&#x301; Pu&#x301;ja&#x301; [Sun Worship] are important food items in Dravidian festivities. Another noteworthy fact is that in the Chat&#x301; and a number of other popular pu&#x301;ja&#x301;s, the Vedics or Brahmans have no place at all, or if they do participate, have a secondary role. The women play a most significant role in these pu&#x301;ja&#x301;s. The speciality of non-Aryan ceremonies is that the women&#146;s role is predominant. Yet another remarkable factor is that although the Vedic sun-god is a male god, the non-Aryan sun-god is female, a goddess. Thus in eastern India worshippers address the sun-god as &ldquo;Chat&#x301; Ma&#x301;yii&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;Chat&#x301; Pita&#x301;&rdquo;. The non-Aryan worship of Dalapati or Gan&#x301;apati (group leader or people&#146;s leader) prevalent in the non-Aryan Austric society, is also prevalent in the Aryan society in the name of Gan&#x301;apati Pu&#x301;ja&#x301; or Gan&#x301;esha Pu&#x301;ja&#x301; [actually this worship meant the worship of the group or society of the Austric people]. The head of an elephant, a big and mighty animal, placed on the shoulders of the deity&#146;s body, was only symbolic of the superiority of the group leader of the society concerned. It is noteworthy that such worship was also prevalent in the non-Aryan Mayan civilization of America.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..50"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=50 type=paragraph -->As said before, the Aryans became acquainted with paddy at a much later period. Previously they had had no idea how to get rice out of paddy, and only learned when they came in contact with the non-Aryans. It was the non-Aryans who taught them to eat boiled rice. It is noteworthy that powdered rice or its paste was widely used in the popular worship of the gods and goddesses of south and east India. It would appear that rice seemed to be rather a queer thing to the Aryans, because in the Vedas it is called tan&#x301;d&#x301;ula. Evidently the Aryans saw grains of rice jumping from the mortar while the paddy was being threshed and husked in the traditional hand-driven or foot-driven husking devices, and thus named it tan&#x301;d&#x301;ula. Tan&#x301;d&#x301;ula means &ldquo;one whose characteristic is to jump&rdquo;. The word ca&#x301;l or ca&#x301;ul [husked but uncooked rice] is derived from the Bengali root ca&#x301;la&#x301; &ndash; which means &ldquo;sifting&rdquo; in order to separate the rice from the chaff.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..51"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=51 type=paragraph -->Spiritual practice was common in the Tantric society. There is no spiritual vigour whatsoever in the lives of those who support pompous, so-called religious, ceremonies, as there is in the lives of introspective spiritual practitioners. After the Aryans came into India, two types of practice used to take place side by side: on the one side the sacrificial fires of the rs&#x301;is, characterized by the smell of burning ghee and the sonorous refrains of those paying homage to the manes while offering oblations into the fire; and on the other side, the non-Aryans&#146; Tantra sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, the practice of self-control and attainment of divine power. Spiritual depth and power of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; brought fearlessness into the spiritual lives of the non-Aryans, as befitting staunch Tantrics.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..52"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=52 type=paragraph -->The non-Aryans regarded the Aryans&#146; sacrificial ceremonies as a time-killing childish pastime and would sabotage them whenever convenient. The Aryan munis and rs&#x301;is asked the Aryan kings for protection against these saboteurs &ndash; or, in the language of the Aryans, these ra&#x301;ks&#x301;asas, pashus and pisha&#x301;cas. Innumerable stories to this effect can be found in different Sanskrit books, even today. Although the words ra&#x301;ks&#x301;asa [demon], pashu [beast] and pisha&#x301;ca [ghoul] were used in a general way to describe the non-Aryans, actually the Dravidians were normally called ra&#x301;ks&#x301;asas (the short-statured among them &ldquo;monkeys&rdquo;), the Mongolians, asuras [monsters], and those Tantrics who did shava sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; [sa&#x301;dhan&#x301;a upon dead bodies] in cemeteries and cremation grounds, pisha&#x301;cas. The Aryans also declared that these gangs of ra&#x301;ks&#x301;asas and pisha&#x301;cas were cannibals. They drew horrible sketches of the dark-complexioned Dravidians and high-cheekboned and flat-nosed Mongolians, with grotesque forms and features, to prove them contemptible and vile. Actually they were a lot more civilized and educated than the Aryans.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..53"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=53 type=paragraph -->Apart from this there were many Aryans who married the daughters of these ra&#x301;ks&#x301;asas and asuras, entranced by their beauty and qualities (those who had a mixture of Mongolian and Dravidian blood had particularly beautiful features). Bhiima married Hid&#x301;imba&#x301;, a non-Aryan girl; Arjuna married Citra&#x301;un&#x32D;gada&#x301;, also a non-Aryan girl. Ra&#x301;van&#x301;a, the leader of the ra&#x301;ks&#x301;asas, had a father from an Aryan Brahman family &ndash; Mahars&#x301;i Vishvashrava&#x301;, the descendent of Pulasta Rs&#x301;i &ndash; and a non-Aryan mother &ndash; Nikas&#x301;a&#x301;, or Kaekasii. In other words, though the Aryans had been proud of their colour and features, that pride faded away within a short time. At that time and also later, even though a few Aryan-proud individuals attempted to defame these ra&#x301;ks&#x301;asas and asuras, the general mass did not pay much attention to them.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="15..59"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=59 type=paragraph -->This civilization, though similar to other civilizations in India, had its own customs and rites, language and mode of pronunciation, manners and behaviour, religious and social systems, rights of inheritance and disinheritance under the Da&#x301;yabha&#x301;ga code of law, and dress and food habits. Proud of its own speciality and uniqueness, it never agreed to be a part of the A&#x301;rya&#x301;vartta [northern India dominated by the Aryan culture]. In order to keep itself free from Aryan subjugation, Bengal rebelled again and again. The northern Indian orthodox Aryans, full of Aryan chauvinism (actually they too were Tantrics, but outwardly displayed an enamel coating of Aryanism), were reluctant to accept the highly Tantric areas such as Aun&#x32D;ga [Monghyr and its adjacent areas], Vaun&#x32D;ga [Bengal]),<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.15.fn8"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#15.fn8">8</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> Kaliun&#x32D;ga [Orissa], Mithila and Magadha [Bihar] as parts of their A&#x301;ryavartta.

<a name="15..60"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=60 type=paragraph -->These orthodox, but internally Tantric, people could not avoid being influenced by the Tantric civilization of eastern India even in their external life. The predominance of the Bengali script of east India (Shrii Hars&#x301;a Lipi) extended up to Praya&#x301;ga in the far west. Most Sanskrit books on Hindu and Buddhist Tantra were written in this Bengali script. After the Muslim invasion, the influence of east India upon north India began to wane gradually. At about that time some Nagar Brahmans from Vedic Gujarat went to northern India to propagate the Vedas and the Sanskrit language. They used Na&#x301;grii script for writing Sanskrit, and under the Brahmans&#146; influence the Na&#x301;grii script too gradually became popular in northern India. The use of Bengali script became confined to eastern India only. It is worth noting that many of the Na&#x301;gar Brahmans of Gujarat were followers of Tantra, particularly Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava Tantra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..61"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=61 type=paragraph -->The greatest difference between the Aryans and the non-Aryans was in their outlook. The Aryans wanted to establish their dominance on the basis of their racial superiority, whereas the non-Aryans, following the precepts of Tantra, did not recognize any distinction among people. The identity of everyone was the same: all belonged to the same family, the family of Shiva. In the first stage of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, everyone is an animal. To merge in Brahmatva [Cosmic Consciousness], after first elevating themselves to devatva [god-hood], was their sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. But in the first stage, while still rising above crude animality, their adorable Shiva was known as &ldquo;Pashupati&rdquo;, &ldquo;Lord of Animality&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..62"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=62 type=paragraph -->Here it is necessary to remember that Tantra is not a religion, but a way of life, a system of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. The fundamental goal of this sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is to awaken the dormant jiivashakti [unit force], known as kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii, and, after elevating it stage by stage, to merge it in Brahmabha&#x301;va [Cosmic Consciousness]. Tantra is a science of spiritual meditation or sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; which is equally applicable to anyone no matter what their religious affiliation might be. Tantra is certainly older than the Vedas. Just as the shlokas or mantras of the Vedas were handed down from guru to disciple in a genealogical tradition, the Tantra sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; of the Mongolo-Dravidian society was handed down from guru to disciple hereditarily. The Vedas are theoretical &ndash; full of ritualistic ceremonies and formalisms. It would be incorrect to regard Tantra as a more recent version of those Vedic rituals: Tantra&#146;s esoteric practices had long been known in the society of sa&#x301;dhakas. Its theoretical portion was not as elaborate as that of the Vedas, which took years and years to memorize.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..63"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=63 type=paragraph -->When the Aryans came to India, roughly during the period of the Atharvaveda, they learned Tantra sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; to some extent after coming in contact with the Indian Tantrics. This resulted in the Atharvaveda being pervasively influenced by Tantra. Even if the orthodox Vedics try to reject the many Tantra-influenced portions of the Vedas as later interpolations, they will not be too convincing, for Tantra has now infiltrated into the marrow of the so-called Aryans. Although during the post-Vedic Buddhist era as well as the post-Buddhist Brahmanical era changes in the religious outlook of the people were apparent, the process of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; remained Tantric as it does even today, for without Tantra spiritual sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is impossible. Yoga, which is the paramount factor in spiritual practices, is itself based on Tantra. The great Tantric Vashis&#x301;t&#x301;ha, when he returned from China after learning the Chinese techniques of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, brought about a great improvement in Tantra sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. He was widely acclaimed as a great yogi. His book Yogava&#x301;shis&#x301;t&#x301;ha is a philosophical exposition of the subtle spirituality of Tantra sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..64"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=64 type=paragraph -->There are many who try to make a distinction between Hindu Tantra and Buddhist Tantra. This is absolutely wrong, for as I have said earlier, Tantra is one and only one. It is based on one sentiment, on one idea. The Buddhist and Hindu Tantras express the same thing in different words. For example, Hindu Tantras use the word kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii for the dormant unit force and id&#x301;a, piun&#x32D;gala&#x301; and sus&#x301;umna&#x301; for the three psycho-spiritual channels. They state that the kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii pierces through the six cakras &ndash; (1) mu&#x301;la&#x301;dha&#x301;ra [situated above the perineum], (2) sva&#x301;dhis&#x301;t&#x301;ha&#x301;na [in the region of the genital organ], (3) man&#x301;ipura [in the region of the navel], (4) ana&#x301;hata [in the region of the heart], (5) vishuddha [in the region of the vocal cord] and (6) a&#x301;jin&#x32D;a&#x301; [between the eyebrows], and finally unites with Paramashiva at the seventh cakra, the sahasra&#x301;ra cakra [at the crown of the head], giving the sa&#x301;dhakas, or intuitional practitioners, the bliss of Cosmic Consciousness. The Buddhist Tantras say the same thing in different words. They have named the man&#x301;ipura cakra, nirma&#x301;n&#x301;a cakra, the ana&#x301;hata, dharma cakra, the vishuddha, sambhoga cakra, and the sahasra&#x301;ra, us&#x301;niis&#x301;a kamala or maha&#x301;sukha cakra.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="15..82"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=82 type=paragraph -->After the Aryan settlement in India a great man was born into the non-Aryan society. Born into a Mongolo-Aryan family, this great man had a high nose and fair complexion. He was a great Tantric - a great yogi. The name of this Maha&#x301;purus&#x301;a of the non-Aryan society was Shiva. For one man to have so many qualities and endowments at the same time was beyond the comprehension of the people, so He was called Gun&#x301;a&#x301;tiita or Nirgun&#x301;a [Transcendental or Non-Attributional] Purus&#x301;a. As the result of His Tantra sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; He attained extraordinary powers, which He employed for the good of humanity. It was He who systematized the science of Tantra and thus He was the guru or the father of Tantrics and yogis. To this Self-realized Maha&#x301;purus&#x301;a there was no distinction of high and low. People of all classes, from the highest to the lowest, were dear to Him. Irrespective of class - Aryan, non-Aryan, Dravidian, Austric or Mongolian &ndash; all flocked to Him. He showered His grace on them all equally. As the battles raged between the &ldquo;gods&rdquo; on the one hand and the &ldquo;demons&rdquo; and &ldquo;monsters&rdquo; on the other (needless to say, &ldquo;gods&rdquo; meant the handsome Aryan leaders, and &ldquo;demons&rdquo; meant the non-Aryans in general), the non-Aryan &ldquo;demons&rdquo; and &ldquo;monsters&rdquo; became more and more powerful through the blessings of this Shiva. All the ra&#x301;ks&#x301;asas and asuras were Shiva&#146;s obedient devotees and followers. With the help and blessings of Shiva they destroyed the might and power of the &ldquo;gods&rdquo;. According to Sanskrit stories, when the gods would seek the help of Brahma&#x301; and Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u, even those two would not dare to oppose Shiva; rather they would save the gods through a compromise with Him.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..83"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=83 type=paragraph -->Shiva had such a forgiving nature, born out of His spirit of benevolence, that even the most wicked could easily draw on His kindness. That is why to everybody He became &ldquo;A&#x301;shutos&#x301;a&rdquo; (&ldquo;Easy to Please&rdquo;). Due to Shiva&#146;s pervasive influence over their society, the non-Aryans, that is, the Tantrics, used to worship Him as God, and according to their respective intellectual strata they regarded and accepted Him in His different bearings. Just as the Aryans began to identify Shiva with their own gods and goddesses, the kaola maha&#x301;ta&#x301;ntrikas [great Tantrics in the tradition of kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii yoga] began to regard their Shiva as identical with Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma. The foremost cause behind this conception of theirs was the absolute detachment and self-forgetful bearing of Shiva, the lord of supernatural and miraculous power. Shiva&#146;s self-sacrificing nature earned Him the name &ldquo;Bhola&#x301;na&#x301;tha&rdquo; [&ldquo;one absolutely indifferent to his own status&rdquo;] among the non-Aryans. All were attracted to Shiva&#146;s supernatural power, His imposing personality, His limitless qualities and the calm, tranquil radiance of His features.<!-- /block --></p>

King Daks&#x301;a was not at all in favour of his daughter marrying a non-Aryan, but eventually he gave way before her adamant attitude. And so Shiva and Princess Gaorii were married. But envy born out of his knowledge of Shiva&#146;s formidable influence over both the Aryan and the non-Aryan societies had already made King Daks&#x301;a mad. Thus one day he publicly insulted Shiva at a large sacrifice specially planned for the purpose. Shiva&#146;s devotees, unable to bear the insult, made a pandemonium of Daks&#x301;a&#146;s ceremonial sacrifice. It is written in the books of the Aryans that Shiva&#146;s two servant-spirits, Nandii and Bhrngii, destroyed Daks&#x301;a&#146;s yajin&#x32D;a.

Just as they revered Shiva as their god, they regarded Gaorii as their goddess.

It was for this reason that she was named &ldquo;Gaorii&rdquo; [which means &ldquo;white-complexioned&rdquo;]. After the marriage, Gaorii lived in the Himalaya Mountains, and was thus often called &ldquo;Parvata Kanya&#x301;&rdquo; [&ldquo;Daughter of the Mountains&rdquo;], or &ldquo;Pa&#x301;rvatii&rdquo; in common language. I told you a little while ago that the non-Aryans used to do Tantra sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; according to their respective intellectual development. They worshipped a pair of gods &ndash; Purus&#x301;a and Prakrti. Whatever their intellectual and spiritual standards, all of them regarded their primary god as Shiva, or, in subsequent periods, some avata&#x301;ra [incarnation] of Shiva; and their primary goddess as Gaorii, or, later, some partial manifestation of Gaorii.<!-- /block --></p>

Although originally there was some social history behind this phallus worship (due to the perpetual warfare between the various clans and tribes, each group felt a constant necessity to increase its numerical strength, and thus they began to worship both the genital organs), in later periods, under the influence of Tantra, it took on a more subtle spiritual form. When, due to the influence of Shiva, everyone began to accept Shiva as their chief god, this liun&#x32D;ga pu&#x301;ja&#x301; [worship of genitals] became [the worship of] Shiva-liun&#x32D;ga and Gaorii-piit&#x301;ha, or Gaorii-pat&#x301;t&#x301;a.

It was Shiva who had taught them spiritual sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, a&#x301;sanas and pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;ya&#x301;ma; the secret of good health; the science of medicine; and the developed art of dance and music. For His excellence in dancing, both the Aryans and non-Aryans used to call Him &ldquo;Nat&#x301;ara&#x301;ja&rdquo;, and for His proficiency in vocal music, &ldquo;Na&#x301;datanu&rdquo;. No one has counted the number of medicines He invented for every kind of disease. He was the first preceptor of the a&#x301;yurveda&#x301;ca&#x301;ryas [teachers of a&#x301;yurveda, the science of medicine to increase longevity]. The asuras were cured of many serious diseases due to His grace. Both the Aryans and the non-Aryans thought that since Shiva knew so many remedies, He was perhaps immortal, and so they named Him &ldquo;Mrtyuin&#x32D;jaya&rdquo; [&ldquo;Conqueror of Death&rdquo;]. When, even today, people come across some incurable disease, they say, &ldquo;Even Shiva has no cure for this disease.&rdquo; Like the non-Aryans, the Aryans eventually accepted Shiva as their god and Gaorii as their goddess.<!-- /block --></p>

The non-Aryan Shiva used to live in cemeteries, cremation grounds, lonesome plains and on the different peaks of the Himalayas. (That is why even today the non-Aryans, pointing to the Himalayan peaks such as Kailash, Gaurishankar, Everest, etc., say, &ldquo;There live our Hara-Gaorii.&rdquo;) But the Aryans turned Him into a full-fledged divinity of the scriptures. To prove that he was Aryan they hung a sacred thread on his left shoulder. (Needless to say, the non-Aryan Shiva had no such sacred thread; he wore a snake around his neck.) Strangely enough, the image of the Aryan god Brahma&#x301; shows no sign of any such sacred thread.

<a name="15..94"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=94 type=paragraph -->That is to say, &ldquo;This Tantra, or A&#x301;gama Sha&#x301;stra, was actually composed by Va&#x301;sudeva [Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, who was considered Aryan], and Shiva only revealed it to Pa&#x301;rvatii.&rdquo; A&#x301;re Ba&#x301;ba&#x301;!<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.15.fn11"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#15.fn11">11</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> &ndash; if Va&#x301;sudeva had at all been the propounder of this doctrine, why on earth would He have put it into the mouth of the non-Aryan Shiva instead of saying it Himself? In the beginning the Aryans used to recognize the superiority of Tantra sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; but practise it in secret; but after acknowledging Shiva, they openly declared themselves to be Tantrics.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..95"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=95 type=paragraph -->Not only in India, but in quite a large part of the world, in every sphere of life, the laws and injunctions of Shiva alone prevailed for a long time. Even today the civilization of modern India is intrinsically Tantric. On the outside only is there a Vedic stamp. Or if we take the Indian civilization as an enamelled ornament, then its gold is Tantric, and the enamel Vedic. For both the wandering sannya&#x301;siis of the cemeteries and cremation grounds, and the householders, this Shiva alone is the ideal man, and Gaorii the ideal woman. Shiva is the universal father and Gaorii the universal mother. Shiva&#146;s household is the three worlds.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="15..98"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=98 type=paragraph -->When the Indians were about to forget the teachings of Shiva due to their fascination with the mundane objectivities of the world, there came another sublime entity like Shiva, who reminded them of those teachings. That great personality was Shrii Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. The question as to which of the two was greater, Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a or Shiva, does not arise, because all knowers of Brahma are one: all are Brahma. Shrii Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a was the supreme teacher and ideal politician of  the  world, what to speak of India alone. Shiva was the guru, the father, of the human society of the world &ndash; a completely different kind of role. Shiva is the universal father. Just as Ca&#x301;nda&#x301; Ma&#x301;ma&#x301; [The Uncle in the Moon] is the uncle of all, Shiva is the father of all.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..99"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=99 type=paragraph -->All three worlds are Shiva&#146;s family. His reputation is not confined to any particular country. Yet if anyone is to be singled out as the father of Indian civilization, or of Indian society, or of the so-called Indian nation &ndash; then I can say emphatically that Shiva alone is eligible to be the father, not only of the Indian nation, but of the universal human nation. Ancient Shiva alone, and no one else, can qualify to be the father of this more-than-five-thousand-year-old so-called Indian race.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="16..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->A kind of mixed Tantra was evolved out of three different spiritual texts: the Puranas, the Tantras, and the Atharvaveda. In this mixed Tantra, the aks&#x301;ama&#x301;la&#x301; was held by a Tantric deity known as Bhadraka&#x301;lii (who is not the four-armed goddess depicted in mythology). When idol worship first started, human beings had not yet learned how to write or recognize the letters of the alphabet. To symbolize those fifty sounds, therefore, a garland of fifty human heads was placed around the neck of the effigy of Goddess Ka&#x301;lii, as it is the human mouth which utters words. The acoustic root of creation is a, the acoustic root of preservation is u, and the acoustic root of destruction is ma. So a, being the acoustic root of creation, was made the first letter. That is why the deity Bhadraka&#x301;lii holds the first letter a in her hand while the remaining forty-nine letters, from a&#x301; to ks&#x301;a, are suspended from her neck. Of course, in the idols made nowadays, just fifteen to twenty faces are placed in the garland. The artists who make these effigies today are not aware of the philosophical significance, nor are the worshippers.<!-- /block --></p>

<div class=book_chapter_info_top></div>

<a name="17..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Yesterday I talked about the Puranic gods and goddesses. In this connection let me tell you one thing more. Various types of Puranic methods, such as <I>nya&#x301;sa<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.17.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#17.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --></I>, <I>pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;ya&#x301;ma</I>, etc., have now become accepted in the Puranic mode of worship, but in fact these methods are of Tantric origin and not related to the Puranas. When doing <I>pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;ya&#x301;ma</I> one will have to concentrate one&#146;s mind on a certain point. This is a Tantric method; when the mind is concentrated on a point it gets confined to a particular space. This method, confining the mind to a certain space, is called <I>Yudhis&#x301;t&#x301;hira Vidya&#x301;</I> in <I>yoga sha&#x301;stra</I>. That is, this was invented by the first Pa&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava brother, Yudhis&#x301;t&#x301;hira.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->However, I will have to say something more about the Puranic system of worship. There are many Puranic worship practices which people are inclined to believe to be very old; many believe that they are as ancient as the Vedas. But that is not the fact of the matter. None of the Puranic systems of worship, or Puranic rituals, is older than 1200 or 1300 years. All those systems of worship are post-Buddhistic, or developed somewhat prior to the period of Buddhist Tantra [which came one thousand years after Buddha himself], or developed, at the earliest, contemporaneously with Buddha.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Numerous Buddhist gods and goddesses later became accepted as Puranic gods and goddesses; for example, the Buddhist goddess Shiitala&#x301; became converted into a Puranic goddess because of the fear of smallpox and some of the Buddhist Tantric gods and goddesses also became converted into Puranic gods and goddesses. For instance, the Buddhist Tantric deity Ta&#x301;ra&#x301; is now accepted as a Puranic deity; these days many Hindus accept Ta&#x301;ra&#x301; Devii. You will find many persons with names such as Ta&#x301;ra&#x301;da&#x301;s, Ta&#x301;ra&#x301;pada, etc. Similarly, the Hindu Tantric goddess Ka&#x301;lii has been accepted in Buddhist Tantra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->For these reasons I was saying that no Puranic ritual or mode of worship is older than 1200 or 1300 years. In the wake left by the collapse of Buddhism [in India], the Puranic religion or neo-Hindu religion emerged, and the Buddhist Tantric gods and goddesses became accommodated in the new religion.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->A new religious movement called the Na&#x301;tha Cult emerged during the period of transition from the Buddhist Era to the Puranic Era. Many gods and goddesses of the Na&#x301;tha Cult can also be detected [in the Puranic religion], for instance Bur&#x301;o Shiva. In fact, most of the Puranic gods and goddesses receiving great reverence in our country are not older than five hundred or six hundred years. If any of them are 1200-1300 years old, that is indeed the maximum.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Some people believe that the worship of Durga&#x301; is something very old, but that is not true at all. This worship became popular during the Muslim period; that is, it is of quite recent origin.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->The system of Durga&#x301; worship was in existence at the time when Krttivasa first composed the Bengali <I>Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a</I>. Since Durga&#x301; worship was a contemporary matter, Krttivasa mentioned the goddess Durga&#x301; in his <I>Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a</I>. For instance, he mentioned that Ramacandra worshipped the goddess Durga&#x301; with 108 lotus flowers. But in the original Sanskrit <I>Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a,</I> Valmiiki&#146;s <I>Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a,</I> these stories are absent. The worship of Durga&#x301; was popular during the time of Krttivasa, and therefore he inserted the story into his <I>Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a</I>. But even in the <I>Ra&#x301;mcaritma&#x301;nasa</I> composed by Tulasii Das, the story is conspicuously absent. Thus we can conclude that it was only created in the imagination of Krttivas. So the idea that the system of Durga&#x301; worship is quite old is entirely unfounded.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->The system of worshipping the goddess Durga&#x301; was first introduced in Bengal by Kamsanarayana Ray, the king of Tahirpur of Rajsahi District [now in Bangladesh], during the Pathan period. King Kamsanarayana had a lot of wealth. He told the pandits, &ldquo;I have so much wealth, I would like to hold the Ra&#x301;jasuya Sacrifice.&rdquo; The pandits said, &ldquo;O king, in <I>Kali Yuga</I> there is no system for holding the Ra&#x301;jasuya Sacrifice [a sacrifice done only by the most powerful kings]. But since you have so much money, you can celebrate the worship of the goddess Durga&#x301; in accordance with the instructions in the <I>Ma&#x301;rkan&#x301;d&#x301;eya Pura&#x301;n&#x301;a</I>.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->The story goes that Kamsanarayana Ray spent as much as 700,000 rupees for the worship of the goddess Durga&#x301;. 700,000 of the rupees of those days mean almost 70 million rupees today. It was a huge expense, and this sparked a competition among the other kings and landlords. The following year King Jagadvaballabh of Ektakia (his name was Jagat Narayana according to other sources) spent 850,000 rupees on the worship of the goddess. In this unhealthy process of competition, the worship of the goddess Durga&#x301; became an affair restricted only to the wealthy landlord households. Actually the display of wealth became the primary motive. There were gargantuan feasts, and a lot of pageantry. &ldquo;I will feed multitudes of people, I will hold huge pageants.&rdquo; The competition went on.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->All kinds of landlord, big, small and medium, began to worship the goddess. This all happened during the period of Pathan rule [just before the Mughal Dynasty]. These are purely Puranic systems of worship, and the books considered authorities for this subject are only the Puranas. None of these books has anything to do with Tantra or Veda, except that they prescribe chanting some <I>rks</I> [couplets] from the <I>Deviisukta</I> [verse] of the <I>Rgveda</I>. Actually, the worship of the goddess Durga&#x301; has no direct relation to the <I>Rgveda,</I> except that incidentally the word &ldquo;Haemavatii Uma&#x301;&rdquo; from the Deviisukta is quoted. [&ldquo;Uma&#x301;&rdquo; is conceived of as another name for Durga&#x301;.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->So you see that the landlords began to worship the goddess with a lot of fanfare. The middle-class people did not have enough resources to organize such expensive religious worship. But perhaps you know that there is a certain place called Hukkipara in Hooghly District. Twelve persons from middle-class families in that Hukkipara village once decided to organize the <I>pu&#x301;ja&#x301;</I> [worship] of the goddess Durga&#x301; collectively, because separately they did not have the resources to organize such worship. In Urdu a friend is called <I>iya&#x301;r</I>. Since twelve friends [in Bengali &ldquo;twelve&rdquo; is <I>ba&#x301;ro</I>] combinedly organized the <I>pu&#x301;ja&#x301;,</I> it was called &ldquo;Ba&#x301;roiya&#x301;rii Pu&#x301;ja&#x301;&rdquo;. At that point in time this form of worship spread from the landlords down to the masses.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Caste distinctions continued to be observed in Ba&#x301;roiya&#x301;rii Pu&#x301;ja&#x301;, but toward the end of the British rule, people began to argue, &ldquo;Since you are collecting subscriptions from all kinds of people, how can we believe in casteism? Let all people participate in this worship.&rdquo; At that time this worship received a new name, &ldquo;Sa&#x301;rvajaniin Pu&#x301;ja&#x301;&rdquo;. This Sa&#x301;rvajaniin Pu&#x301;ja&#x301; is also <I>ba&#x301;roiya&#x301;rii</I>, but caste distinctions are disregarded.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->In Tantra there is some reference to Durga&#x301;, but to <I>as&#x301;t&#x301;abhu&#x301;ja&#x301;</I> [an eight-armed one &ndash; ten-armed was more common]. In western India and northern India, similar <I>as&#x301;t&#x301;abhu&#x301;ja&#x301;</I> stone and metal images are sometimes unearthed during excavation work. So the quarrel is whether the deity has eight or ten hands.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->One of the characteristics of Tantra is this, that the different gods and goddesses originate from one idea or other. Those ideas were conceived in order to arouse and develop the finer sensibilities of the human mind. Thus a person conceived of a certain idea, and to make concrete that abstract idea, an image was invented. But such an idea, whether good or bad, is not an integral idea, it is a non-integral idea. If human beings try to give expression to one such idea out of many, that means that other ideas are excluded. In any case, this is how there arose the various gods and goddesses in Tantra, through a process of giving external form to abstract ideas.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="17..30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->It is not that the concepts of different gods and goddesses are based on Tantric ideas alone. For instance, when people suffer terribly from various incurable diseases, they conveniently invent one deity Raks&#x301;a&#x301; Ka&#x301;lii (that Ka&#x301;lii which protects one from disease). When society faces some problem, people worship Shmasha&#x301;na Ka&#x301;lii or Va&#x301;ma&#x301; Ka&#x301;lii, and so on.

This much is the difference between the two deities. Then again there are other deities, such as Durga&#x301;, Navadurga&#x301;, etc. The system of worship of Navadurga&#x301; &ndash; she is worshipped through nine varieties of plant &ndash; is centered around Tantra, but the worship of Durga&#x301; in general does not originate in Tantra. The worship of Durga&#x301; originated in the Puranic tradition.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->The nine kinds of plant having special qualities of their own are themselves treated as deities. They are repositories of power, but of partial nature. They are not as vast as the Supreme Entity. As they are conceived to be as powerful as the goddesses, they are worshipped. These nine plants are <I>kadalii</I> [plantain], <I>kacu </I>[arum], <I>haridra&#x301;</I> [turmeric], <I>jayantii</I> [sesbania], <I>ashoka</I> [sarica], <I>bilva</I> [bel-fruit], <I>da&#x301;d&#x301;imba</I> [pomegranate], <I>ma&#x301;n</I> [alocasia], and <I>dha&#x301;nya</I> [rice].

The nine plants are worshipped as symbols of nine Tantric deities.

So you see, you are still not adopting the qualities of all those medicinal herbs. And suppose you do adopt all the qualities of all the herbs, there are still so many animals roaming around, and various animals have various qualities which might be great assets to human beings. You may have seen certain lizards that sit silently on the walls in a state of ambush for cockroaches. You will see that the lizard does not move even slightly for ten to fifteen minutes. Is not this patience and stillness a wonderful quality? Very few human beings have that quality. They cannot sit silently that long, they become restless. You do not have that quality, you cannot sit silently that long. Ants move in long columns, sheep also move in long columns; an ox stands in the middle of the road without the least motion.

<a name="18..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Now the question is, what is the underlying spirit or essence of dharma? The underlying spirit or essence of dharma is that it carries a person in the direction of greater and greater expansion, and finally establishes that person in the supreme pervasiveness. (By the &ldquo;essence of dharma&rdquo; we mean its purest part, its innermost existence.)<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.18.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#18.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The essence of Shaeva Dharma [Shaivism] is all-round expansion &ndash; that is, it takes an individual from the loka&#x301;yata [mundane] to the lokottara [supramundane] life. Shaivism is that which takes the individual to the supreme fulfilment along a sweet and more and more resplendent path. Shaeva Tantra [Shiva Tantra] is not a cult based on the sayings of the munis and rs&#x301;is, rather it is concerned with the hopes and aspirations of the masses. It is something which deals with the subtler mystic aspect of human life.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Here let us try to understand the subtle difference between the loka&#x301;yata and the lokottara worlds. Suppose there is a bird &ndash; take the case of a bird confined in a cage. The bird in a cage eating little morsels of food can be likened to loka&#x301;yata sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, and the restless, intense psychic urge to soar freely into the vast distant blue sky can be compared with lokottara sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. Shaeva Dharma in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h is Tantra-oriented; and as I have said, Tantra means all-round expansion. As the inhabitants of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h accepted this Tantra from the core of their hearts, even in the distant prehistoric past, they made multidimensional progress: progress in art and literature, progress in dance and music, progress in architecture and sculpture. The inhabitants of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h made unimaginable progress in all spheres of human life.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="19..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->When I spoke regarding Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.19.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#19.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->, I said that His life can be divided into two main parts: the first part is Vrajagopa&#x301;la and the second part is Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi. I also said in that context that Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi was not as easily accessible as Vrajagopa&#x301;la was. I further said that the Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.19.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#19.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  was brought about by Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a but it certainly did not encompass the whole of Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s life. Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a exists without the Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata, but the Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata does not exist without Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Regarding Shiva, we should say that His life cannot be divided in this way into two parts. From the very beginning, He was an omnipresent entity. Whenever, in the undeveloped and simple human society of those days, any need arose, Shiva was there to help; whenever any knotty problem developed, Shiva was there to solve it. So we cannot divide and analyse His life and personality into fragments, nor can we write the history of those times in that way. At the same time I feel constrained to state that, considering His unique role in building human culture and civilization, this culture and civilization cannot stand without Him. But Shiva can stand very well, shining in His own glory, quite apart from human culture and civilization. So to write history in the true sense of the term, for the sake of human society at present and in the distant future as well, Shiva cannot be neglected.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Let us first analyse the meaning of the term shiva. In trying to find the meaning of the word shiva, we must know whether or not the Sanskrit language was used in those days. Some people say that the Sanskrit language was imported to India from Central Asia, but this does not seem to be correct. Rather it is more reasonable to say that in those days one almost identical language was current all the way from Central Asia and Eastern Europe to Southeast Asia. The branch of that language that was popular in the southeastern part of that expanse was called Sanskrit, while the language that was spoken in the northwestern parts was Vedic.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The Aryans migrated to India from outside, no doubt, but the Aryan influence was not so discernible in the southeastern as in the northwestern parts of India. The Vedic language came to India with the Aryans, but the Sanskrit language is an indigenous language of India; it did not come from outside. I have stated this fact clearly in my recently-published book on Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.19.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#19.fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->It is not at all possible to trace the exact antiquity of the Vedic language, because the only book that is available in that language is the ancient Rgveda, and the Rgveda was not in written form in those days either. The people of those days did not know how to read and write; they had no knowledge of any alphabet. They were not at all acquainted with the letters a, a&#x301;, ka, kha,<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.19.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#19.fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  etc.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->The alphabet &ndash; the Bra&#x301;hmii script, the Kharos&#x301;t&#x301;hi script, and the subsequent scripts born out of them &ndash; were invented some time during the last five thousand to seven thousand years. The Sa&#x301;rada&#x301;, the Na&#x301;rada&#x301;, and the Kut&#x301;ila&#x301; scripts were variants of the old Bra&#x301;hmii script, and the Shriihars&#x301;a<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.19.fn5"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#19.fn5">5</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  script is a variant of the Kut&#x301;ila&#x301; script. The script in which modern Bengali is written is the Shriihars&#x301;a script.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->The composition of the Rgveda [began] about fifteen thousand years ago. Scripts were totally unknown in those days. It would not be incorrect to say that although the human race came onto the earth about a million years ago, its civilization started only about fifteen thousand years ago. This shows that human civilization and human culture are not very old in relation to the antiquity of the human race. We should not belittle civilization for being so recent, but neither can we venerate it as being very old.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->In the days of Shiva, the Aryans started entering India from the northwest. Many of them had already arrived, many were on the way, and many were still making preparations to come. The Vedic language of the Aryans who had already arrived in India had exerted a widespread influence on the spoken dialects of the indigenous population of India, such as the Kash, the Scythians, the Euchi, the South Kus&#x301;a&#x301;n, etc. Obviously, Sanskrit, the common language of the indigenous people of the then India, was not outside the orbit of influence of the Vedic language; but that influence was not unilateral; that is, the Vedic language was also influenced by the Sanskrit language. Tantra had its origin in India, and Shiva gave a systematic form to it. Of course, Tantra in its Ka&#x301;shmiirii and Gaod&#x301;iiya Schools did exist before Shiva, but in a scattered and crude form. So naturally one has to admit that Shiva was born and brought up in an environment of Tantra, although it was not classical Tantra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Shiva was well acquainted with the Vedic language and the Vedic religion. Both in the Vedas and in the Tantric treatises, we come across references to Shiva, but not in very ancient texts, because it was not possible to put works in writing in very ancient times, due to the lack of knowledge of the alphabet. [Thus much material was lost.] The Tantric texts used to advise people, &ldquo;You should do this, you should do that, you should hear and learn these lessons from your masters,&rdquo; and so on; because in those days it was not possible to write books, as scripts had not yet been invented. The Vedas would also advise people in the same way &ndash; to hear and learn things from the masters. That is why the Vedas are called shruti in Sanskrit. Shruti means &ldquo;ear&rdquo;; so that which is learned by hearing is called shruti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->The period of Shiva was a most turbulent period in India. On the one hand there were the Aryans, the outsiders, and on the other hand there were the indigenous people, with their Tantra-oriented culture and religion. Into this conflict-ridden environment, Shiva was born.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Now, what is the derivative meaning of shiva? From the extant texts on Tantra and Veda and from all other written and unwritten sources, we get three meanings of the term shiva. The first and most important meaning of shiva is &ldquo;welfare&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..12"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Ana&#x301;dyanantamakhilasya madhye<br>Vishvasya sras&#x301;t&#x301;aramanekaru&#x301;pam;<br>Vishvasyaekam&#x301; parives&#x301;t&#x301;aram&#x301;<br>Jin&#x32D;a&#x301;tva&#x301; Shivam&#x301; sha&#x301;ntimatyantameti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..13"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->[Knowing that Shiva, who has neither beginning nor end, who is<br>the creator of this vast universe &ndash;<br>That multi-formed single entity who encompasses the whole<br>universe &ndash; one attains eternal peace.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Here shiva means &ldquo;welfare&rdquo;. Shivamastu means the same as Kalya&#x301;n&#x301;amastu [&ldquo;May you be blessed&rdquo;]. Kalya&#x301;n&#x301;asundaram is the representation of Shiva embodying the true spirit of blessedness.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->People say that He has been serving people, doing good to them, with five faces. He is described as having five faces: two on the left &ndash; Va&#x301;madeva and Ka&#x301;la&#x301;gni; two on the right &ndash; Daks&#x301;in&#x301;eshvara and Iisha&#x301;na; and one in the middle &ndash; Kalya&#x301;n&#x301;asundaram, the Supreme Controller which controls all the individual&#146;s desires for action.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Daks&#x301;in&#x301;eshvara, the extreme right face of Shiva, is so called because He is showering daks&#x301;in&#x301;a&#x301; [compassion] upon the created beings. That is the special role allotted to Daks&#x301;in&#x301;eshvara. Iisha&#x301;na &ndash; the face next to the right &ndash; is responsible for controlling all the jiivas, individual beings, with meticulous care. And Kalya&#x301;n&#x301;asundaram, the face in the centre, plays the role of controlling all the faces.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Now the question is, why is Kalya&#x301;n&#x301;asundaram assigned such a role? His only purpose is to promote the greatest welfare of all living beings; He has no other purpose.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->In addition, Shiva has two faces on the left: Va&#x301;madeva on the extreme left, and Ka&#x301;la&#x301;gni next to the left. Va&#x301;madeva is terrible &ndash; rudra, rudra&#x301;tirudra, rudro&#146;pirudrah &ndash; &ldquo;one who teaches others by making them shed tears&rdquo;. But the underlying purpose is to teach people, not to harm them. The other face, Ka&#x301;la&#x301;gni, also subjects people to excruciating torture, but there also, the main purpose is to teach them, to promote their welfare. Now here also, the two roles of Va&#x301;madeva and Ka&#x301;la&#x301;gni are controlled by the central face, Kalya&#x301;n&#x301;asundaram. He is sundaram, beautiful, because He promotes kalya&#x301;n&#x301;a [welfare]: hence, &ldquo;Kalya&#x301;n&#x301;asundaram&rdquo;. He is terrible, but at the same time superbly calm and tranquil. Yet behind His apparent dreadfulness and tranquillity lies the kalya&#x301;n&#x301;asundaram bha&#x301;va [mental flow]. He is both severe and tender. He is tender, so naturally people love Him. Although He is severe, people still adore Him, because underlying His apparent severity, there is tenderness. Thus the role of Shiva is predominantly the role of a promoter of welfare. So the first meaning of the term shiva is &ldquo;welfare&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->The second meaning of the term shiva is &ldquo;cognition in its zenith status&rdquo; &ndash; the zenith status of the Cognitive Principle, the Supreme Non-Attributional Process, the Supreme NonAttributional Entity beyond the faculties of all existential bondages. I will elaborate on these meanings as appropriate later.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->The third meaning is Sada&#x301;shiva, who was born into this world about seven thousand years ago &ndash; and who, by His holy birth, consecrated, as it were, each and every dust particle of this earth and utilized His whole life for the sole purpose of advancing the cause of universal welfare. Remember, I have not said &ldquo;human welfare,&rdquo; because in our world, not only are there humans, there are also birds and animals, trees and plants. Shiva belongs to all; and for all living beings, He gave His all. Hence the people called Him &ldquo;Sada&#x301;shiva&rdquo;; sada&#x301; means &ldquo;always&rdquo;, and shiva &ndash; as I have said earlier &ndash; means &ldquo;welfare&rdquo;. So &ldquo;Sada&#x301;shiva&rdquo; means &ldquo;one whose only vow of existence is to promote the all-round welfare of all living beings&rdquo;. I will gradually tell you about this extraordinary personality. I hope you will deeply relish the discourses on this great man, this great personality.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->Now the question remains: in the night of blinding darkness, do humans alone aspire to feel the soothing touch of light? No, all want it. All seek to grow out of the oblivion of existential darkness into the warmth of life, to experience finally the fulfilment of their life&#146;s urges. Up until this day, human beings have not made a proper appraisal of this great personality, this Maha&#x301;sambhu&#x301;ti,<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.19.fn6"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#19.fn6">6</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> who gave human beings their first opportunity to experience the sweet joy of fulfilment of all their longings.

<a name="20..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->In fact, the A&#x301;rs&#x301;a Dharma ["Religion of the Sages", Aryan Religion] was not dharma at all &ndash; it was nothing but a geo-sentiment, sometimes combined with socio-sentiment. This continued for a long period. Shiva observed that this was not dharma at all. He looked deeply into human psychology and found that human beings do not really want happiness &ndash; they want absolute peace: peace is better than happiness. People do not attain peace by performing yajin&#x32D;as [sacrifices] nor by sacrificing animals in the sacrificial fire. They may please their palates by eating meat, but they will not attain peace in this way. Shiva showed human beings how to attain peace; and that path to supreme peace should not be called a path of ordinary attainment, but of supreme attainment. Here the spiritual realization is aparoks&#x301;a&#x301;nu&#x301;bhuti &ndash; is direct. This path, as shown by Shiva, is known as Shaeva Dharma [Shaivism].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Of course, Tantra did exist before Shiva, but it was scattered, not well-organized. As I told you a little earlier, Shiva made everything systematic and regulated. He brought about a harmonious synthesis between those scattered Tantras and the people&#146;s spiritual urges for supreme fulfilment, and created His Shaeva Dharma, which was above all sorts of geo-sentiment and socio-sentiment. This path of Shiva, which was a happy blending of the existing Tantra and His practical processes, was an ideal adjustment between the objective world and the subjective world. In spite of that, this cult was not able to survive the ravages of time. One of the reasons was that in those days it was not possible to write anything down because script had not yet been invented. Knowledge was conveyed orally, not by writing. The Vedas could not be written due to the same difficulty.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Much later, when the Vedas were written down, many portions had already been lost. However much we may try to find those lost portions of the Vedas, they can unfortunately never be recovered. Many of the teachings of Shiva were also lost for the same reason, because people had no knowledge of the alphabet. This Shiva Tantra inspired people to move towards the supreme truth on the one hand, and on the other hand it exhorted people, "Do not neglect the practical world. Maintain a congenial adjustment with the external world." His instructions were, "Vartta&#x301;manesu vartteta [Live in the present]. Try to penetrate as deeply as you can into your mind, keep moving inwards &ndash; Caraeveti, caraeveti [Proceed on, proceed on]. But do not forget the realities of the external world, because if you ignore the external realities, your internal peace will also be disturbed."<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->This Shaeva Dharma became the essential dharma of India.  In this dharma no one was ignored &ndash; neither the non-Aryans nor the women nor the untouchables.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->In the Vedic Age, women as a class were neglected and treated as mere commodities of enjoyment; whereas in the age of Shiva they were proclaimed as a class of mothers. As the influence of Shiva was comparatively great in Bengal, there we still find the custom of addressing unknown ladies as Ma&#x301; ["Mother"]. In Bengali, aunts are called ma&#x301;si-ma&#x301; [mother&#146;s sister], pishi-ma&#x301; [father&#146;s sister], etc.; that is, the word ma&#x301; is respectfully added when addressing women. And as the matriarchal system is still prevalent in Bengal to some extent, there the women are not altogether separated from the father&#146;s lineage. After marriage their gotra [clan] changes, no doubt, but they still have some relation with their father&#146;s lineage. For this reason a nephew, a sister&#146;s son, inherits the properties of his maternal uncle if he dies without heirs.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Shaeva Dharma is the dharma for attaining Parama Purus&#x301;a, and thus there is no external ritual in it. It does not enjoin any ritualistic offering of ghee, or any sacrifice of animals&#146; blood in yajin&#x32D;a; it is not a path of self-gratification. The followers of Shaeva Dharma proclaimed in a thundering voice that dharma is the path leading to supreme attainment &ndash; not the path of animal enjoyment.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="21..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Is Shiva a philosophy or a personality or a deity? We must first say a little about Shivatattva [the inner meaning of Shiva], devata&#x301;tattva and daevii shakti, and then analyse Shiva and the other gods and goddesses who are claimed to be related to Him. There are deep-seated questions in human minds about this, but all the questions remain unanswered.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Shiva was a great personality. At the same time, His entire life we may say, His very way of life is a philosophy. And when one&#146;s personality becomes fully identified with one&#146;s philosophy of life, one becomes a god.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..3"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Dyotate krid&#x301;ate yasma&#x301;t udyate dyotate divi;<br>Tasma&#x301;t deva iti proktah stu&#x301;yate sarvadevataeh.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..4"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->[The vibrational manifestations emanating from the Supreme Nucleus are known as devata&#x301;s, and these devata&#x301;s address that Supreme Nucleus as Deva. He with His powers vibrates the entire universe, makes the entire universe dance; and He by dint of His occult and supra-occult powers brings everything back onto His lap.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The endless expressions of life emanating from the Universal Nucleus which move all-pervasively in and through everything of the universe and influence all entities are called devata&#x301;s [deities, gods and goddesses]. Shiva&#146;s ideology is totally identified with His life, with His way of life. Hence, Shiva is definitely a devata&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Now while we are discussing devata&#x301;tattva [the inner meaning of a devata&#x301;] we must add something more. Normally, each and every expression that emanates from the Supreme Hub, the Cosmic Nucleus, is a devata&#x301;. In that sense, Shiva is not merely one such devata&#x301;; He is the aggregate of these devata&#x301;s. Shiva is no doubt a god, but the word &ldquo;god&rdquo; does not encompass the totality of His personality. He is not only a god, He is the God of gods  Devata&#x301;na&#x301;m&#x301; devata&#x301;, devana&#x301;m&#x301; devah ityarthe Maha&#x301;devah [&ldquo;The God of all gods and goddesses is Maha&#x301;deva&rdquo;]. Shiva is Maha&#x301;deva.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Now it is necessary to discuss those entities who were involved with Shiva, such as Pa&#x301;rvatii, Ka&#x301;lii, Gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301;, Sarasvatii, Laks&#x301;mii, etc.; and all the other gods and goddesses of Shiva Tantra, Buddhist Tantra, Jain Tantra, Post-Shiva Tantra and the Puranic religion. First we shall find out how much Shiva was related to them from the philosophical, social and personal points of view  or whether there was any relation between Him and them at all.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->In this context, the topic of daevii shakti must be discussed. When some wave of expression emanates from the Universal Hub and moves in the process of systalsis, two main forces are active, Prajin&#x32D;a&#x301;tattva [the Cognitive Force] and Shaktitattva [the Operative Force]. The former is called Citishakti, and the latter is called Ka&#x301;lika&#x301; Shakti. It is called Ka&#x301;lika&#x301; Shakti because the Operative Force maintains Her creation through ka&#x301;lacakra, the eternal time factor. (This has nothing to do with the deity Ka&#x301;lii.)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Now, to discuss Shivatattva, devata&#x301;tattva and daevii shakti, we must review briefly a long period of history stretching over seven thousand years. In the field of applied Tantra that was popular during Shiva&#146;s lifetime, there were different forces, no doubt, but they were not deified into gods and goddesses. So to say something about gods and goddesses, we must go back still further. In the Vedic Age there were gods and goddesses, but there was no system of idol worship. People used to worship those gods and goddesses through sacrificial rituals. Indra, A&#x301;gni, Varun&#x301;a, etc., were all Vedic gods, but they were not worshipped with idols. Nor was there any system of worshipping Parama Brahma [the Supreme Entity] with idols. It was said that Iishvarasya pratima&#x301; na&#x301;sti [&ldquo;There cannot be any finite pratima&#x301;, image, of God&rdquo;]. Pratima&#x301; means &ldquo;duplicate&rdquo;, something identical to the original. Suppose there is an eggplant. If we create an object exactly like the original eggplant, we say that the second eggplant is the pratima&#x301; of the original eggplant. But as there is no other entity like Parama Purus&#x301;a, Parama Purus&#x301;a cannot have a pratima&#x301;. Tula&#x301; va&#x301; upama&#x301; Krs&#x301;n&#x301;as-ya na&#x301;sti [&ldquo;Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a has no parallel or equal&rdquo;]. These were the ideas of the Vedic Age.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Next came the age of Shiva Tantra. In those days, many ka&#x301;lashaktis [deities] were accepted, but there was no system of idol worship. Then followed the age of Shivottara [Post-Shiva] Tantra, during the periods of Buddhism and Jainism. During this period, various systems of worshipping different gods and goddesses were introduced. In the subsequent period, that is, the period of the metamorphosed Post-Shiva Tantra (metamorphosed because it was Shiva Tantra but largely influenced by Buddhism and Jainism), image-worship became quite popular.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.21.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#21.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Now in the course of time, when Post-Shiva Tantra evolved, Shiva was still a devata&#x301;, but the Buddhist and Jain Tantra of that time exerted some influence on His image, and, by adding some new elements to the existing image of Shiva, tried to create a new entity. Sometimes, in the Puranic Age, Shiva was invested with a sacrificial thread, but in reality Shiva never had any thread on His body; if He had any, it was a thread of snakes.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Later, many gods and goddesses were brought to the scene and linked with Shiva,  because  until an  entity&#146;s  relation to Him was established in one way or other, that entity would not get any recognition at all. Take for instance the goddess Manasa&#x301;. Sometimes she is said to be the daughter of Shiva, but in reality, there was no goddess named Manasa&#x301; or Vis&#x301;ahari at the time of Shiva. In the Puranic Age, it was declared,<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..13"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->A&#x301;stikasya munerma&#x301;ta&#x301; Va&#x301;sukiibhaginii tatha&#x301;;<br>Jaratka&#x301;rumuner patnii manasa&#x301;yae namo namah.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Manasa&#x301; was said to be the mother of A&#x301;stika Muni and the sister of Va&#x301;sukiina&#x301;ga and the wife of Jara&#x301;tka&#x301;ru Muni. We will not raise any objection to the statement that she was the mother of A&#x301;stika Muni, but we cannot accept that she was the sister of Va&#x301;sukiina&#x301;ga. There is a story in one Purana that she was the sister of Va&#x301;sukiina&#x301;ga,<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.21.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#21.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> but according to another Purana, Kadru was the mother of serpents and Mahars&#x301;i Ka&#x301;shyapa was their father. In that case the father of Manasa&#x301; is Ka&#x301;shyapa. Then how can she be the daughter of Shiva? So the Puranas are mutually contradictory. In fact, Manasa&#x301; has no relation to Shiva; Manasa&#x301; is only a laokik<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.21.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#21.fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  goddess and was recognized as such in Buddhist Tantra and the Puranic religion. Shiva, however, was a great personality about seven thousand years ago, whose existence does not depend upon the tales of the Puranas. The Puranas were composed about 5500 years after Shiva.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->After Manasa&#x301;, let us take the case of Pa&#x301;rvatii. What is the meaning of the word Pa&#x301;rvatii? Some may derive it as Pa&#x301;rvatasya duhita&#x301;, pa&#x301;rvatasya kanya&#x301; (using s&#x301;as&#x301;t&#x301;hii tatpurus&#x301;a<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.21.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#21.fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> ) that is,  &ldquo;daughter of a hill&rdquo;.  Obviously the question will arise, and quite logically, how can a human girl whose body is made of five fundamental factors be the daughter of a hill? A river may be called the daughter of a hill, but in the case of a human girl we cannot say that. So the derivation of Pa&#x301;rvatii as pa&#x301;rvatasya kanya&#x301; is not logically acceptable; rather, the proper derivation is Pa&#x301;rvatadeshiiya&#x301; kanya&#x301; ityarthe Pa&#x301;rvatii (using madhyapadalopii karmadha&#x301;ray<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.21.fn5"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#21.fn5">5</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->): &ldquo;a girl born in a hill state&rdquo;. So when people say that Pa&#x301;rvatii was the daughter of the Himalayas, it does not mean that she was the daughter of a person named Hima&#x301;laya, but that she was a person born in the Himalayan Range. This Pa&#x301;rvatii was fair-complexioned; that is, she was an Aryan girl.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->In the then India, the mutual relations between the original inhabitants of India (Austrico-Mongolo-Negroids) and the outsiders, the Aryans, were by no means cordial. The Aryans, out of deep-rooted contempt for the indigenous people of India, used to call them sometime asuras, sometimes da&#x301;navas, sometimes da&#x301;sas, sometimes shu&#x301;dras.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.21.fn6"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#21.fn6">6</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  The Aryans did not accept these people in their society; rather, they declared them to be outcastes. But these ancient people of India, of Austrico-Mongolo-Negroid blood, had their own civilization and culture. They were also developed people: they had their science of Tantra, and their medicine. There was  a  prolonged  conflict  between  these  people  and  the Aryans.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Pa&#x301;rvatii was the daughter of an Aryan King, Daks&#x301;a, who ruled in the Himalayan regions. Many people were hopeful that after the marriage between Pa&#x301;rvatii and Shiva, the relations between the Aryans and the non-Aryans would improve. During the period of the vow of penance that Gaorii (another name for Pa&#x301;rvatii) undertook in order to attain Shiva as her husband, she used to dress in the fashion of a Shavara girl (the Shavaras were one of the non-Aryan communities). She used to stitch turmeric leaves together to make improvised outer garments. One of the Sanskrit words for &ldquo;turmeric leaves&rdquo; is parn&#x301;a. As she would wear par&#x301;n&#x301;a as her clothes, she was called &ldquo;Par&#x301;n&#x301;ashavarii&rdquo;. Later, after she became successful in her penance, people requested her, &ldquo;Now please set aside the turmeric leaves and wear fine clothes.&rdquo; When she actually discarded the crude turmeric leaves, she was nicknamed &ldquo;Aparn&#x301;a&#x301;&rdquo;. Unfortunately, even after the marriage between Shiva and Pa&#x301;rvatii, the relations between the Aryans and the non-Aryans did not improve; rather they became more strained  the conflicts became more acute than before. Gaorii&#146;s father, Daks&#x301;a, and the Aryans continued their slanderous campaign against Shiva, and finally, to humiliate Shiva, they held a yajin&#x32D;a [sacrificial ceremony] to which Shiva was not invited. Pa&#x301;rvatii went to attend the yajin&#x32D;a, and unable to bear the insults to her dear husband, immolated herself in the sacrificial fire.<!-- /block --></p>

Gaorii, or Pa&#x301;rvatii, was a human girl, and as such, she had only two arms. The ten-armed goddess Durga&#x301;, who was a deity of the Puranic Age, has nothing to do with Shiva or His age.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->The worship of the goddess Durga&#x301; is based mainly on the Ma&#x301;rkan&#x301;d&#x301;eya Pura&#x301;n&#x301;a, and to a lesser extent on the Devii Pura&#x301;n&#x301;a, the Ka&#x301;lika&#x301; Pura&#x301;n&#x301;a, the Brhatnandikeshavara Pura&#x301;n&#x301;a, the Duraga&#x301;bhaktitaraunginii, the Deviibha&#x301;gavat, etc. None of these books is older than 1300 or 1400 years. Seven hundred shlokas [couplets] were collected from those books and gathered together, and that constituted the abridged Ma&#x301;rkan&#x301;d&#x301;eya Pura&#x301;n&#x301;a, which is also known as Durga&#x301;saptashatii, or more colloquially, Shrii Shrii Can&#x301;d&#x301;ii. None of these works existed at the time of Shiva; they have no relation with Him.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->There are some people who believe that Durga&#x301; is the wife of Shiva, but this is not logically proved by any scriptural evidence. Shiva had only two arms, not four or six. Pa&#x301;rvatii also had two arms. But Durga&#x301; is a Puranic goddess, and the author of pura&#x301;n&#x301;a [educative fiction] can create in his imagination as many arms of Durga&#x301; as he likes. Nobody can object to this.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->No system for the worship of Durga&#x301; is prescribed by the Vedic scripture; so to put a Vedic seal of approval on the worship of Durga&#x301;, the famous Deviisu&#x301;kta of the Vedas is cited. But Haemavatii Uma&#x301; [Durga&#x301; is sometimes also called &ldquo;Uma&#x301;&rdquo;], who is mentioned in the Deviisu&#x301;kta of the Vedas, has no relation whatsoever to Pa&#x301;rvatii (or Gaorii), the wife of Shiva, nor to Durga&#x301;, the Puranic goddess. People have been thinking erroneously that Durga&#x301; was the wife of Shiva, but in reality she had no relation to Shiva.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->Yes, Shiva did have a wife &ndash; Gaorii, or Pa&#x301;rvatii. And another wife was Ka&#x301;lika&#x301;, or Ka&#x301;lii. Ka&#x301;lii was born in a non-Aryan community which was ethnically Austrico-Mongolo-Negroid. Now you may wonder about Ka&#x301;lii&#146;s appearance. Why is she undressed? Why is she sticking her tongue out? There are many tales about these matters, but you must not give any importance to these stories; you must discover the real history behind these things.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->One of Shiva&#146;s wives was Gaorii, who had a son, Bhaerava. &ldquo;Bhaerava&rdquo; means &ldquo;one who practises Tantra sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;&rdquo;. Another wife of Shiva, Ka&#x301;lii, had a daughter, Bhaeravii. &ldquo;Bhaeravii&rdquo; means &ldquo;a woman who practises Tantra sa&#x301;-dhana&#x301;&rdquo;.

At that time Shiva was deeply absorbed in meditation in the cremation ground.  Ka&#x301;lii, while  walking along the path, trip- ped over Shiva. She felt extremely contrite and stuck her tongue out.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.21.fn8"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#21.fn8">8</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> Shiva was roused from His meditation, and asked, Kastvam&#x301;?  &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; Now, Ka&#x301;lii was deeply embarrassed, but being Shiva&#146;s wife, how could she conceal her identity by introducing herself as Bhaeravii? A woman cannot identify herself to her husband by the name of her daughter.

<a name="21..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->Later Ka&#x301;lika&#x301; Shakti, also called Ka&#x301;lii, was accepted in Post-Shiva Tantra and also in Buddhist Tantra as a Tantric goddess. Still later, in the Puranic Age, this Ka&#x301;lii was worshipped as a goddess, and at that time she got a second name, Shya&#x301;ma&#x301;. But this Ka&#x301;lii, or Ka&#x301;lika&#x301; Shakti, has no relation to Ka&#x301;lii the wife of Shiva. Ka&#x301;lii the wife of Shiva existed seven thousand years ago; but Ka&#x301;lii the deity accepted in Post-Shiva Tantra and Buddhist Tantra goes back only 1600 or 1700 years. The worship of Ka&#x301;lii the deity is preached chiefly on the basis of the Ka&#x301;lika&#x301; Pura&#x301;n&#x301;a, so it has nothing to do with the Vedic Age nor the age of Shiva.

<a name="21..31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->Not only that, there is also a difference in meaning between ka&#x301;lii and shya&#x301;ma&#x301;. First, it is a fact that Ka&#x301;lii or Shya&#x301;ma&#x301;, who is worshipped as a goddess nowadays, has no relation to Shiva. Then, regarding her colour, in one part of the shloka she is described as meghavarn&#x301;a, that is, grey-black [&ldquo;having the colour of a cloud&rdquo;] (Ka&#x301;lii the wife of Shiva was a non-Aryan girl, so she may have been that colour); then again she is described in the same shloka as shya&#x301;ma&#x301;. The word shya&#x301;ma&#x301; in Sanskrit has two meanings. One meaning is &ldquo;green&rdquo;. Ka&#x301;lii, who is grey-black, cannot be shya&#x301;ma&#x301; in this sense; there would be an inconsistency in meaning, a contradiction in the shloka itself.

<a name="21..34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->So we find that neither the goddess Durga&#x301; worshipped nowadays nor the goddess Ka&#x301;lii, is the wife of Shiva.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->No goddess having eight or ten arms can be the wife of Shiva: He had only two arms. Similarly the Ka&#x301;lika&#x301; Shakti having four arms cannot be the wife of Shiva.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..36"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph -->Shiva had a third wife &ndash; Gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301;. She was a Mongolian girl with a yellow complexion, born in Tibet. I said a little while ago that Gaorii had a son, Bhaerava, and Ka&#x301;lii had a daughter, Bhaeravii. Gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301; had a son  Ka&#x301;rttikeya, or Ka&#x301;rttika, or Sanmukham, or S&#x301;ad&#x301;a&#x301;nana. (In Tamil San&#x301;-mugam, Ba&#x301;lasubrahman&#x301;yam or Muru&#x301;gam).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..37"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=37 type=paragraph -->Bhaerava, the son of Pa&#x301;rvatii, was an ardent spiritualist, a Tantric sa&#x301;dhaka. Bhaeravii, the daughter of Ka&#x301;lika&#x301;, was also an ardent spiritualist and a sincere practitioner of Tantra; but Gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301;&#146;s son, Ka&#x301;rttika, was of a different mould. Because of this Gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301; was very sad at heart; she was very unhappy with her only son. To remove Gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301;&#146;s mental unhappiness, Shiva used to treat her with the utmost courtesy. People would complain that Shiva was not so soft and courteous in His dealings with Pa&#x301;rvatii and Ka&#x301;lii as He was with Gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301;. He was pampering Gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301; too much &ndash; as if Shiva was dancing in joy, with Gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301; seated on His head.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..38"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=38 type=paragraph -->On the basis of this saying, Shiva was depicted in the Puranic Age with Gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301; tied to His matted locks of hair. Then a story was concocted in some Purana that the water discarded after washing the feet of Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u, flowed down from heaven, and Shiva supported the flow on His head; then this flow became the River Gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301; [Ganges]. That is, Gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301; the wife of Shiva became the River Gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301;. Actually this River Gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301; has no relation whatsoever to Shiva.

The River Gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301; has no relation to Gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301; who was the wife of Shiva. &ldquo;Gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301;&rdquo; the river is derived from gam plus gam plus d&#x301;a plus t&#x301;a&#x301; (to show feminine gender). Ga means a vast tract of land; ga&#x301; means a woman who is moving; so a woman who is coming from a distant land and going towards another distant land  a woman who is flowing from Gaun&#x32D;gottarii, the starting-point of the River Ganges, to Gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301;sa&#x301;gar, the mouth of the river  through a 1500-mile stretch of land  is called &ldquo;Gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301;&rdquo;.

<a name="22..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->In the age of Shiva, towards the end of Shiva&#146;s lifetime, the Aryan and the non-Aryan communities admitted the supremacy of Shiva. There were no longer conflicts between the Aryans and the non-Aryans regarding the issue of deities; there was no difference of opinion as to which great personality should be respected. Shiva was accepted as the supreme personality in the Vedas, and as such was considered a god. In the Vedic Age, people who worshipped the Vedic gods and goddesses accepted Shiva as one of them, and started worshipping Him and generally following His instructions. They used to follow only the ritualistic portions of the Vedas (the yajin&#x32D;as) and followed Shiva in all other matters. But those who did not follow even these ritualistic portions of the Vedas but followed Shiva in all matters were called Shaeva Ta&#x301;ntriks [followers of Shiva Tantra].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Perhaps you know that in the Vedas, the Tantras, and partly in Post-Shiva Tantra, particular gods were worshipped with specific biija mantras [acoustic roots]. Shiva was not worshipped with any particular acoustic root during His own time, in Shiva Tantra, because the people considered Shiva so much their own, so intimate with them, that they did not feel the necessity to worship Him with the help of any acoustic root. And Shiva really did become one of them. Thus they did not depend on any acoustic root to invoke Him. The then followers of the Vedas accepted the supremacy of Shiva, but their relation with Him was not so intimate. As I have already said, there was no system of idol worship in those days, but they used to accept Shiva as their deity of transmutation &ndash; as the transmutational principle.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.22.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#22.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> The people in those days used m [the sound &ldquo;mm&rdquo;] as the acoustic root for the process of transmutation, the process of metamorphosis.

<a name="22..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Although Shiva was accepted in the Vedic Age, He himself did not follow the Vedic cult. He accepted only the Tantric cult and adhered to it very strictly, and persuaded others to do the same. You know that the Jain religion was introduced a little more than two thousand years ago, but the Shiva Cult is much older than the Jain religion. Some people claim that the Tiirthaun&#x32D;kars (the original Jain prophets) existed even before the advent of Vardhama&#x301;n Maha&#x301;viira; they propagated Jainism, but it was undoubtedly long after Shiva. When Jainism was spreading in India, Shiva had already become a god of the people; He had penetrated into all walks of Indian life and become intimately associated with each and every aspect of social life. This was not only because of His extraordinary personality and genius, but because of His pervasive influence in all spheres of human life. Though Jainism is quite old, and efforts were made to propagate it, the people of that age accepted it only superficially. Jainism received quite a good  response in India,  particularly  in the  Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h  area,  but<!-- /block --></p>

By historical research, it has been found that Jainism is mainly Digamvara.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.22.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#22.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> But later a time came when the Nirgranthava&#x301;da of Digamvara Jainism (granthi means &ldquo;knot&rdquo;, so nirgranthi means &ldquo;not using the knots of clothes&rdquo; &ndash; that is why the doctrine was known as &ldquo;Digamvara&rdquo;) was not appreciated by the householders, and it was primarily they who introduced the Shveta&#x301;mvara doctrine, although Jainism is primarily Digamvara. Later this Nirgranthava&#x301;da of Jainism was associated with Shaivism. People were outwardly Digamvara Jain, but in the core of their hearts they were Shaivites. All the idols of Digamvara Tiirthaun&#x32D;kars which have been found are naked. Now let us move to another topic.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->In the prehistoric age, before even the Vedic Age started, people used to follow the system of phallic worship. I have mentioned in my book on Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h that in those days there were severe conflicts among the different clans. They were never secure, neither at night nor during the day; so they always wanted to increase their numbers. Thus they worshipped the phallus as the symbol of their earnest desire to multiply. This phallic worship was more or less in vogue in almost all the countries of the world, not just in one particular country. Phallic worship was common in India, Southeast Asia, and Central Asia, and also widely prevalent in Central America &ndash; that is, in  the  southern part of  North America  and  northern part of South America. Some think that this phallic worship was brought to America from India during the Shriishaelendra Empire of Andhra under the Pahlava, Pandya, and Chol Dynasties of South India. The phallus worshippers of Central America belonged to the Mayan civilization; thus America is called Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;dviipa in Sanskrit [Mayan Island]. However, the fact is that those people followed this phallic worship from prehistoric times more as a social custom than as a spiritual or philosophic cult. In the Jain age, the naked idols of the Tiirthaun&#x32D;kars aroused a new thought in the minds of the people, and thus for the first time phallic worship was introduced as part of the spiritual cult of Digamvara Jainism. Shaeva Dharma existed side by side with Digamvara Jainism; alongside the Jain and Buddhist doctrines, there existed Shiva Tantra<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.22.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#22.fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> also in a metamorphosed form, which may be designated as Post-Shiva Tantra. In this way the worship of Shiva-liun&#x32D;ga [phallic worship] was introduced in Post-Shiva Tantra through the influence of Jainism. Thus the prehistoric phallic worship, being associated with a newer spiritual awareness and philosophical outlook, produced a new trend of thought. (It should be remembered that metaphysics had already emerged by that time, for Jainism and Buddhism were propounded after the great  sage Mahars&#x301;i  Kapila.)  Thus  the worship of Shiva-liun&#x32D;ga was introduced about 2500 years ago. But the phallic worship of the pre-historic age,  and the  worship of Shiva-liun&#x32D;ga in medieval India (around 2250 years ago), were not the same. The latter, invested with a novel philosophical and spiritual significance, awakened a new trend of human thought. The people of that time started worshipping Shiva-liun&#x32D;ga with a new outlook, just as they gave new significance to the Tiirthaun&#x32D;karas. The intention behind the prehistoric phallic worship, as I have already said, was the worshippers&#146; earnest desire to increase their numbers &ndash; because they had to fight day and night to survive. But in later times, when Shiva-liun-ga worship was introduced in Jain Tantra, Buddhist Tantra, and Post-Shiva Tantra, it received a new interpretation, Liun&#x32D;gate gamyate yasmin talliun&#x32D;gam [&ldquo;The entity [[from which all things originate and]] towards which all things are moving is liun&#x32D;gam&rdquo;]. All the psychic flows and existential vibrations are flowing in the maha&#x301;ka&#x301;sha, the maha&#x301;vyoma [the eternal void], and these vibrational expressions will finally terminate in that Supreme Principle of Transmutation, that Supreme Metamorphosis. So this Shiva-liun&#x32D;ga is the final destination of all expressions, the culminating point of all existence. Thus the mode of worship of Shiva-liun&#x32D;ga was altogether transformed.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Now this worship of Shiva-liun&#x32D;ga which began in the age of Jainism spread throughout every fibre of Indian life. In this new style of Shiva worship, both the dhya&#x301;na mantra<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.22.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#22.fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> and biija mantra of Shiva were changed. Now it is necessary to explain this biija mantra. All the phenomena, all the vibrational expressions in this universe have colour and sound. The human eye may be unable to perceive those subtle colours, and the human ear unable to catch those subtle sounds, but their existence cannot be denied just because of human inability to perceive them. Many  animals and birds can  perceive  subtle  vibrations and understand things which humans cannot  for instance, the olfactory capacity of tigers and dogs is far greater than that of human beings. Often dogs can identify miscreants by their smell. Each and every expression has its own sound, and the collection of all sounds is on&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra &ndash; a-u-m. A [the sound &ldquo;uh&rdquo;] is the acoustic root of creation, and u [the sound &ldquo;oo&rdquo;] is the acoustic root of operation, and m is the acoustic root of destruction. The sound created by a particular vibration is called its &ldquo;acoustic root&rdquo; in Latin. The concept of so-called gods and goddesses is based on these acoustic vibrations, the sound expressions which emanate from the Supreme Consciousness and flow in various directions. This is the science behind the acoustic roots.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->The acoustic root of Shiva as mentioned in the Vedas was m [the sound &ldquo;mm&rdquo;]. I have already said that no acoustic root was necessary for the worship of Shiva [during His own time] because He was so intimate with all people. But in the age of Jain Tantra, Buddhist Tantra, and Post-Shiva Tantra, the acoustic root became aem&#x301;. This ae vowel is also an acoustic root.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->If we analyse this aum-sound,<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.22.fn5"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#22.fn5">5</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> we find fifty root-sounds, and these root sounds are all within the vast spectrum of eternal time. Within this spectrum there are infinite undulations of the waves of time. Time is nothing but the mental measurement of the motivity of action. Whenever there is action, there is motivity. Time is not an unbroken flow, but consists of disjointed elements. These elements are so closely connected that they seem to become one integral whole although actually it is not continuous. However, these fifty separate emanations are all sustained by this so-called temporal factor. These are: a, a&#x301;, i, ii, u, u&#x301;&#8230; ks&#x301;a.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.22.fn6"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#22.fn6">6</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> So the alphabet is called aks&#x301;a or aks&#x301;ama&#x301;la&#x301; [ma&#x301;la&#x301; means &ldquo;garland&rdquo;] &ndash; it is conceived as a garland of fifty letters.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->During the time of the Atharvaveda it was thought that these fifty letters are being sustained by the time factor. I have already said that this conception of the Atharvaveda was wrong because the time factor is not an integral whole but a series of many separate entities. So these fifty letters of the on&#x32D;m sound are combined in the time factor. In the age of the Atharvaveda, people learned to read and write, although there was no system for writing the Vedas in black and white. Thus it was conceived that the time factor had put on the fifty letters in a garland, and each letter was symbolized by a human face. The letter a was kept in the hand because a is the acoustic root of creation, and the rest of the letters (a&#x301; to ks&#x301;a) were put in the garland of Bhadraka&#x301;lii &ndash; a goddess of the Atharvaveda. It has been said:<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="22..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->You understand that this Bhadraka&#x301;lii [a concept of the Atharvaveda which features the fifty letters] is not an integral whole either, but an aggregate of partial entities; so this is also a wrong concept from the philosophical point of view.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.22.fn7"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#22.fn7">7</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> <!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Now, the letter ae (one of the twelve vowels) is called the va&#x301;gbhava biija [acoustic root of speech]. A sprout emerges from every seed, and the seed from which the sprout of wisdom emerges is called the seed of the spiritual guide, the guru; so aem&#x301; came to be the acoustic root of the guru. Shiva was generally accepted as the guru. So in the age of Jain, Buddhist and Post-Shiva Tantra, aem&#x301; became accepted as the acoustic root of Shiva. The incantative rhythm of Shiva&#146;s worship became Aem&#x301; Shiva&#x301;ya namah. But in the Vedic Age it was m.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Now let us consider the Jain Shiva. Nowadays large-size Shiva-liun&#x32D;gas are being excavated in different parts of India, especially in the Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h area. These are images either of the Jain Shiva or of the Shiva of the Post-Shiva Tantra of the Jain Age. In that age, there was intensive cultivation of knowledge throughout India. People considered this aem&#x301; (the root of wisdom and speech) to be an ideal acoustic root for knowledge. A long time later, when the worship of Sarasvatii, the goddess of learning, was introduced, she was given the same acoustic root (aem&#x301; &ndash; the acoustic root of speech). Aem&#x301; Sarasvatyae namah [&ldquo;Salutations to the goddess Sarasvatii&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->Thus far I have been talking about the Jain Shiva. The Jain Shiva has not been accepted in Shaeva Dharma but is accepted in Jain society because it was impossible to establish any doctrine without the influence of Shiva. In later times, Jain society was divided into different sections and sub-sections, and it influenced the contemporary Post-Shiva Tantra also. And then divisions arose regarding the worship of Shiva, and also differences of opinion about the system of Shiva-liun&#x32D;ga worship which had been practised since the Jain period. Some special types of Shiva-liun&#x32D;ga were called jyotirliun&#x32D;ga, other types were called a&#x301;diliun&#x32D;ga, others were called ana&#x301;diliun&#x32D;ga &ndash; thus there were many different branches of Jainism, each with its own Shiva-liun&#x32D;ga and its own style of worship. Another distinct type of Shiva-liun&#x32D;ga is the Va&#x301;n&#x301;aliun&#x32D;ga, but it was of a much later period, the Puranic Age. King Va&#x301;na, the monarch of north Bengal (then called Varendrabhu&#x301;mi), invented the Va&#x301;n&#x301;aliun&#x32D;ga Shiva. In this way, the worship of Shiva underwent many changes in the Jain Age.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Now, the followers of Jainism are all vegetarians. The followers of Shiva are also vegetarians. But the Shiva Cult was more practical and thus it became the valuable asset of human beings, while Jainism became estranged from the people because of its impractical nature. For example, according to Jainism, tilling the land is not permitted because it would kill many worms and insects, thereby violating the principle of non-violence. But Shaeva Dharma is quite practical. Lord Shiva said Varttama&#x301;nes&#x301;u vartteta [&ldquo;Live in the present&rdquo;]. In other words, &ldquo;Never ignore the practical realities of life.&rdquo; So even in the age of Jainism, the followers of the Shiva Cult used to cultivate the land, because to refrain from agriculture was not common sense. Again, the followers of Jainism covered their faces with a piece of cloth so that insects might not enter their noses and die. The followers of the Shiva Cult did not do such things, and they even fought if necessary, for they strictly followed the instructions of Shiva. There was much similarity between these two cultures, but in comparison with the culture of Shiva, the Jain culture had some serious drawbacks.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->Now let us consider the Buddhist Shiva. Just as Shiva was worshipped in the age of Jain culture and Jainism influenced Post-Shiva Tantra and was also influenced by it, the same thing occurred in the Buddhist Age.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->The Buddhist Age and the Jain Age occurred simultaneously. Lord Maha&#x301;viira was about fifty years older than Lord Buddha. There was a pervasive influence of Maha&#x301;ya&#x301;na Buddhism in some parts of India, China and Tibet. At that time, the Maha&#x301;ya&#x301;na branch of Buddhism split into two sections, both of which embraced Tantric culture. The Shiva of Post-Shiva Tantra was accepted in Buddhist Tantra, and the followers of the latter also preferred to worship the Shiva-liun&#x32D;ga instead of worshipping idols of Shiva.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->You should remember that there is no mention of the worship of Shiva-liun&#x32D;ga in the dhya&#x301;na mantra of Shiva. From this it is clear that the worship of Shiva-liun&#x32D;ga was introduced much later.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->Because of the vast popularity of Shiva, He could not be neglected even in the Buddhist Age, and the worship of the Shiva idol or Shiva-liun&#x32D;ga was accepted, only with a little difference. Shiva was not accepted as a perfect god. He was accepted as a bodhisattva, and a small image of Buddha was affixed to the image of Shiva. In some cases, a small image of Buddha was attached to the head of the image of Shiva at the time of Shiva&#146;s worship. The intention was to make it clear that Shiva was not a perfect god. He was a bodhisattva, and it was Buddha who was the goal of worship for Shiva. This kind of Bodhisattva Shiva became Bat&#x301;uka Bhaerava, then Bor&#x301;o Shiva, then Bur&#x301;o Shiva [Old Shiva], at a later time.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->In the remote villages of Bengal, many temples of Bur&#x301;o Shiva are found. These images of Bur&#x301;o Shiva are from the Buddhist Age. The worship of this Buddhist Shiva was widely popular on the eastern side of the Himalayas, in Tibet, and in some parts of Bengal; it was introduced in Bengal during the days of Vajraya&#x301;na Buddhism.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->It would not be irrelevant to say that though Vajraya&#x301;na was prevalent in India, Tibet and a considerable part of China, the centre or the controlling point of it was a village named VajraYoginii of Vikrampur of Dhaka district. A Chinese a&#x301;ca&#x301;rya [spiritual teacher] of Buddhist Tantra lived there, named Pha&#x301;ha&#x301;-u-ca&#x301;. This village and Vikrampur are still existing. The history of Vikrampur goes back much earlier than the Puranic Age. If I ever narrate the history of Bam&#x301;ga-Daba&#x301;k [southern Bangladesh], many things are to be said about this Vikrampur. In the age of Buddhist Tantra, the name of Vikrampur was Vikram Man&#x301;ipur &ndash; not Vikrampur. On&#x32D;m&#x301; man&#x301;ipadme hum was the mantra of Vajraya&#x301;nii Buddhism. The name Vikram Man&#x301;ipur has been derived from this Man&#x301;ipadma Mantra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->Anyway, Shiva was worshipped as a bodhisattva in the Buddhist Age. At that time a small idol of Buddha was set on the head of the image of Shiva or on the Shiva-liun&#x32D;ga. The acoustic root of this Buddhist Shiva, the Jain Shiva and the Shiva of Post-Shiva Tantra was aem&#x301;. This aem&#x301; is the acoustic root of speech and hearing, the root from which all knowledge springs.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->Then came the Shiva Cult and Sha&#x301;kta Cult of the Puranic Age. In this age also, the worship of Shiva continued. The Puranic concept of Shiva was the consolidation of the worship of the twenty-two varieties of Shiva-liun&#x32D;ga, including the jyotirliun&#x32D;ga, the ana&#x301;diliun&#x32D;ga, the a&#x301;diliun&#x32D;ga, etc., plus the Shiva-liun&#x32D;ga of King Va&#x301;na. But the interesting thing is that the Shiva of this Puranic Age was quite different from the Shiva of Jain, Buddhist, or Post-Shiva Tantra. Consequently the acoustic root of Shiva also changed from aem&#x301; to haom&#x301;. The acoustic root of the Puranic Shiva became Haom&#x301; Shiva&#x301;ya namah.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->The concept of a deity must change if there is a change in its acoustic root. So Sada&#x301;shiva, the very shelter of human life for seven thousand years, and this Shiva of the Jain, Buddhist or Post-Shiva Tantra, are not the same person.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->There is another interesting thing which people generally ignore. You will notice that when Buddhism was gradually transformed into Puranic Shaivism, that transitional period was the age of the Na&#x301;tha Cult. The word na&#x301;tha [lord] used to be appended to the names of the prophets of the Na&#x301;tha Cult, for instance A&#x301;dina&#x301;tha, Miinana&#x301;tha, Matsyendra-na&#x301;tha (who invented Matsyendra&#x301;sana), Goraks&#x301;ana&#x301;tha, Gohiniina&#x301;tha, and Caoraungiina&#x301;tha (after whom Chowringee street in Calcutta has been named). These were the spiritual teachers of the Na&#x301;tha Cult.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->This Na&#x301;tha Cult was the result of the synthesis between Buddhist Tantra and the Puranic Shiva Cult. All the masters of the Na&#x301;tha Cult were considered as avata&#x301;ras [incarnations] of Shiva; that is, after the death of these masters, people made idols of them and worshipped them in the temples as incarnations of Shiva. Thus just as the word na&#x301;tha was appended to the names of the masters, it was also appended to the names of Shiva when He was worshipped &ndash; for instance, Ta&#x301;rakana&#x301;tha, Vaedyana&#x301;tha, Vishvana&#x301;tha, etc.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->These deities were the objects of worship for the followers of the Na&#x301;tha Cult; they had nothing to do with the Sada&#x301;shiva of seven thousand years ago. There was a vast time gap of about 5500 years between the two. Although in the Shiva Cult and the Sha&#x301;kta Cult of the Puranic Age people continued the worship of Shiva-liun&#x32D;ga, they used to append the word iishvara [controller or lord] to the names of Shiva just to differentiate their Shiva from the Shiva of the Na&#x301;tha Cult. For instance, Ta&#x301;rakeshvara, Vishveshvara, Ra&#x301;meshvara, etc. Sometimes they used to name Shiva with the addition of both na&#x301;tha, in the manner of the Na&#x301;tha Cult followers, and iishvara, in the manner of the Puranic Shiva Cult. For instance, they would say either, or both, Ta&#x301;rakana&#x301;tha or Tara&#x301;keshvara, Vishvana&#x301;tha or Vishveshvara. (But the Vaedyana&#x301;tha of Deoghar cannot be called Vaedyeshvara.)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->From this one can easily distinguish which Shiva was worshipped by which cult &ndash; which was worshipped by the Na&#x301;tha Cult followers, and which by the Puranic Shiva Cult followers.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="22..36"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph -->Again it is said:<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="22..39"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=39 type=paragraph -->This is how Shiva is variously worshipped by the followers of different cults. In some places He is addressed as na&#x301;tha by the followers of the Na&#x301;tha Cult, in other places as iishvara by the followers of the Puranic Shiva Cult. The acoustic root for Shiva in all these cases is haom&#x301;, and as there has been a change in the acoustic root, this Shiva is not the Shiva of seven thousand years ago.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="23..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->From the study of history, it is known that the Rgveda was composed outside India, mainly in Central Asia and Russia. The Yajurveda was written mostly outside India; only a portion was written in India. And the Atharvaveda was composed in Afghanistan and India. Those three Vedas &ndash; Rk, Yaju and Atharva &ndash; long afterwards, say about 3500 years ago &ndash; were edited and divided into different branches by Mahars&#x301;i Krs&#x301;n&#x301;advaepa&#x301;yana Vya&#x301;sa. The oldest compositions were named Rgveda, the intermediate portions were called Yajurveda, and the remaining portions were named Atharvaveda. The last-named Veda was named after the great sage, Atharva, the first author of this Veda. And by compiling the musical compositions of the three Vedas, yet another Veda - the Sa&#x301;maveda, the fourth Veda &ndash; was created. Sa&#x301;ma in Sanskrit means &ldquo;musical composition&rdquo;. The Sa&#x301;maveda itself is not a Veda.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Sada&#x301;shiva was born at a time when the age of the Rgveda was coming to an end and the Yajurvedic Age was about to begin. The people had not yet invented script. In the days of Shiva, the serious disadvantage was that, although the people were acquainted with the science of phonetics, that is, the intonations of the letters, they did not know how to write the letters. The Bra&#x301;hmii and Kharos&#x301;t&#x301;hi scripts were invented some time after Shiva. Thus we can generally say that the Vedas and Tantra exercised their mutual influence over each other, through the invention of script, only at the time of the Atharvaveda.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The external form that was given to Tantra by Shiva in His time underwent a slight transformation in subsequent periods. You may raise the question &ndash; well, when the goal is the same, when the path is also the same, then why this transformation? The only cause was: there was no written book in those days. All the compositions &ndash; both Vedas and Tantras &ndash; were handed down orally from one generation to another. As a result, there arose a difference of opinion among the teachers themselves &ndash; one teacher or muni [seer] would say one thing, and another muni would say something else.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Now although letters were invented during the age of the Atharvaveda, the Vedas could not be written down due to one obstacle &ndash; a peculiar superstition (better to call it a dogma) that the Vedas should not be written down. Mahars&#x301;i Atharva&#146;s followers &ndash; Aungira&#x301;, Aungirasa, Satyava&#x301;ha, Vae-darbhi, etc., tried for the first time to get the Vedas written down in letters, but they were not courageous enough to do so because it was forbidden. (The very name of Vaedarbhi suggests that he was a resident of Vidarbha, and in India, particularly in the Vidarbha area, the Atharvaveda was partly written. Hence it is not proper to assume that the entire Veda was written outside India.) The Vedas were called shruti [ear] because they had to be mastered only by hearing: letters had not yet been invented. But once the script was invented, what could be the reason for not writing down the Vedas? The problem was the superstition, and the scholars did not dare to defy the superstition.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Now the Post-Shiva Tantra that gradually crystallized through the transformation of the original Shiva Tantra had two branches - the Gaod&#x301;iiya School and the Ka&#x301;shmiirii School. In East India, that is, Bengal, where the Gaod&#x301;iiya School of Tantra was popular, the Vedas had little influence. But in Kashmir, where the Ka&#x301;shmiira branch of Tantra was more dominant, there was the influence of both Tantra and the Vedas. During those days of ascendancy of the Ka&#x301;shmiira branch of Post-Shiva Tantra, the Ka&#x301;shmiira scholars first wrote the Vedas in contemporary Sa&#x301;rada&#x301; script; that is, the Vedas were written first in Sa&#x301;rada&#x301; script. Later came the age of Buddhism and Jainism; of course Post-Shiva Tantra was running parallel to them. Script had already been invented. The books on Jainism were mostly written in Pra&#x301;krta, in a Bra&#x301;hmii script which was a bit transformed; while the books on Buddhism were written in Ma&#x301;gadhii Pra&#x301;krta, that is, in Pa&#x301;li, in the Bra&#x301;hmii script of that time. But the Post-Shiva Tantra was written in Sanskrit; of course in Bra&#x301;hmii script. So this all proves that the invention of scripts removed a great obstacle on the way. At this time there was a mutual exchange of ideas among Jain Tantra, Buddhist Tantra and Post-Shiva Tantra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->When some ideas or schools of thought exist side-by-side for a long period in a certain country, there is bound to be some sort of mutual exchange, and the result of this type of exchange cannot but be beneficial. It is often found that the result is either good or, at the worst, neither good nor bad. For instance, the Puranic concept of the deity Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a and the Islamic concept of Piirabhakti combined together to give rise to a new concept of Satyapiira in Bengal. Its effect was not bad.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Similarly, those three schools of Tantra &ndash; the Jain, the Buddhist, and the Shivottara [Post-Shiva] &ndash; began to come to an understanding. All three schools broadly accepted the division of Tantra into sixty-four main branches, considering its various expressions. The only difference that persisted was the external one of differences in terminology: each school retained certain specific terms  of its own. But they all generally accepted that human life had sixty-four types of expression, and hence there were sixty-four branches of Tantra. In their internal essence, they were not very far from one another; only certain terms - something external &ndash; were used differently by different Tantras. For instance, the Mu&#x301;la&#x301; Prajin&#x32D;a&#x301; Shakti [Fundamental Cognitive Principle] was called Jinaratna or Jinaraana in Jain Tantra &ndash;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..8"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Bhan&#x301;ai Ka&#x301;hn&#x301;u jina raan bi kaesa&#x301;<br>Ka&#x301;len&#x32D; bob samvohia jaesa&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..9"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->&ndash; whereas in Shiva Tantra, rather in Post-Shiva Tantra, the word Shiva was used, and Buddhist Tantra used the various epithets of Buddha. Thus the sixty-four Tantras were running parallel.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->For each of these sixty-four Tantras, one particular yoginii-tattva was accepted as the presiding deity (a particular controlling deity of a particular branch of Tantra was called a yoginii). All three Tantras accepted this arrangement. And all three, in order to maintain their popularity, used the name of Shiva &ndash; they declared that each Tantric deity was the wife of Shiva. Those of you who have gone to Jabbalpur might have noticed the sixty-four small temples on a hill there dedicated to these sixty-four yoginiis. They are all sixty-four Jain Tantric deities. Similarly, in Buddhist Tantra, particularly in Vajraya&#x301;nii Buddhist Tantra, sixty-four deities were accepted. Shivottara Tantra followed the same practice.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Interestingly, you will notice how at this stage a silent synthesis was taking place among the different schools. Some of the Jain deities were recognized by Buddhist Tantra (for instance, the Jain deity Ba&#x301;ra&#x301;hii, with a swine&#146;s face, was transformed into Vajraba&#x301;ra&#x301;hii in Vajraya&#x301;nii Buddhist Tantra). Shivottara Tantra gave similar recognition to deities of other Tantras. Conversely, some of the deities of Shivottara Tantra were recognized and accepted by Jain and Buddhist Tantra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->All this proves that the synthesis of these three systems  of Tantra charted a new path. This was all made possible by the invention of script. As long as script was unknown or unused, they maintained their distinct separateness; but with the popular use of script, they began to come closer to each other. For example, Ambika&#x301; is an accepted deity of Jain Tantra. But then she also became recognized by Shivottara Tantra &ndash; she was supposed to be a wife of Shiva. (But as you know, these deities cannot be the wives of Sada&#x301;shiva, who is seven thousand years old, whereas these deities are all of comparatively recent origin &ndash; about two thousand years old &ndash; arising after the invention of script.) This Ambika&#x301; Devii has been accepted in a different manner in Paora&#x301;n&#x301;ik Sha&#x301;kta&#x301;ca&#x301;ra [the Puranic Sha&#x301;kta Cult], as the goddess Laks&#x301;mii, but actually she is a Jain deity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->In Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h,<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.23.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#23.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> there is a town named Kalna where there is still a temple dedicated to the goddess Ambika&#x301;. Once there was a tremendous influence of Jainism in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. The town was named Ambika&#x301;-Kalna, after the goddess, and is now called Enbo-Kalna.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Another instance: the Buddhist goddess Ta&#x301;ra&#x301; was accepted in Shivottara Tantra, and still later, in Paora&#x301;n&#x301;ik Sha&#x301;kta&#x301;ca&#x301;ra. And her changed form was accepted in Paora&#x301;n&#x301;ik Sha&#x301;kta&#x301;ca&#x301;ra as the goddess Sarasvatii. The goddess Ka&#x301;lii of Shivottara Tantra was accepted in Buddhist Tantra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Thus there came an age of synthesis. And following this synthesis, these deities were accepted as gods and goddesses in Paora&#x301;n&#x301;ik Shaeva&#x301;ca&#x301;ra [the Puranic Shiva Cult] and Paora&#x301;n&#x301;ik Sha&#x301;kta&#x301;ca&#x301;ra in somewhat changed form. This form underwent slightly more transformation during the middle of the Pathan Age, whose influence still lingers in a minor form.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Now in the process of synthesis among Jain, Buddhist and Shivottara Tantra, there evolved a new concept, the concept of Dashamaha&#x301;vidya&#x301; [Ten Maha&#x301;vidya&#x301;s], centring around those deities who had general influence in all three systems of Tantra. The idea of Dashamaha&#x301;vidya&#x301; arose out of ten Tantric deities, some from Jain Tantra, some from Buddhist Tantra and some from Shivottara Tantra. These deities, in slightly changed form, were accepted in Paora&#x301;n&#x301;ik Sha&#x301;kta&#x301;ca&#x301;ra, Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava&#x301;ca&#x301;ra, Shaeva&#x301;ca&#x301;ra and Ga&#x301;n&#x301;a-patya&#x301;ca&#x301;ra [the Puranic Sha&#x301;kta Cult, the Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u Cult, the Shiva Cult and the Gan&#x301;apati Cult]. While analysing the history of Dashamaha&#x301;vidya&#x301;, it is interesting to see how the concept of each deity evolved &ndash; how an idea dawned upon the human mind and gradually expanded in the path of synthesis until finally its basic defects demolished its own fundaments.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->These Ten Maha&#x301;vidya&#x301;s are Ka&#x301;lii, Ta&#x301;ra&#x301;, S&#x301;od&#x301;ashii, Bhuvaneshvarii, Bhaeravii, Chinnamasta&#x301;, Dhu&#x301;ma&#x301;vatii, Bagala&#x301;mukhi, Ma&#x301;taungii and Kamala&#x301;. These deities are present in all three Tantras. Sometimes their biija mantras [acoustic roots] are the same, sometimes different. For your proper understanding, let me give you a brief idea about these ten deities.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="23..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->The first of these deities is Ka&#x301;lika&#x301;. She is one of the controlling deities of Shivottara Tantra, but simultaneously she was accepted in Buddhist Vajraya&#x301;na. I have said a number of times that Shiva was the most influential personality. Therefore an attempt was made to establish some kind of relationship with Him: it was announced that Ka&#x301;lika&#x301; was Shiva&#146;s spouse. But one should remember that Shiva was born five thousand years before the age of Ka&#x301;lika&#x301;; so how could Ka&#x301;lika&#x301; be His wife? Secondly, Ka&#x301;lika&#x301; &ndash; this controlling deity &ndash; is depicted as having four hands. No human structure can have four hands. So Ka&#x301;lika&#x301; Shakti &ndash; Ka&#x301;lii &ndash; this deity &ndash; is not Shiva&#146;s wife. She is a Tantric deity belonging to subsequent ages.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->The second deity is Ta&#x301;ra&#x301;. Ta&#x301;ra&#x301; is one of the Tantric deities of Vajraya&#x301;na Tantra. I have said previously that the Ta&#x301;ra&#x301; that was worshipped in India was known as Ugrata&#x301;ra&#x301;, while the deity that was worshipped in China was called Bhra&#x301;marii Ta&#x301;ra&#x301; &ndash; &ldquo;black as a bumblebee&rdquo; &ndash; and the one who was worshipped in Tibet (Kim&#x301;purus&#x301;avars&#x301;a, as it was known previously) was blue-coloured. So this Ta&#x301;ra&#x301; was later than Buddha, and later yet than Shiva; hence Ta&#x301;ra&#x301; cannot be accepted as the wife of Shiva either.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->There is not even any similarity in name. Shiva did have one wife whose name was Ka&#x301;lii, so she has at least the similarity in name with Ka&#x301;lii, the deity of Post-Shiva Tantra. But this was not the case with Ta&#x301;ra&#x301;. Ta&#x301;ra&#x301; is purely a deity of the Buddhist Vajraya&#x301;na Tantra. But she is accepted as a deity in Post-Shiva Tantra and the Puranic Sha&#x301;kta Cult.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Even today, you will come across boys with names such as Ta&#x301;ra&#x301;pada, Ta&#x301;ra&#x301;prasa&#x301;da, etc., and girls with such names as Ta&#x301;ra&#x301;devii. This is the history behind these names.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Ta&#x301;ra&#x301; has no relation to Shiva. People wrongly believe that she is the wife of Shiva. I shall say something more about Ta&#x301;ra&#x301; later, when I discuss Sarasvatii.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->Then comes S&#x301;od&#x301;ashii, the third deity. In this connection, let us say something about biija mantra [acoustic roots]. At the time of Shiva, there was no use of biija mantra in Shiva Tantra. The people loved Shiva so intimately that they did not think it necessary to worship Him with a particular biija mantra. In subsequent periods the use of biija mantra became an accepted practice. In Buddhist Tantra, the acoustic root of Ka&#x301;lii was ram&#x301;: this was also the acoustic root of energy. This biija mantra signifies the application of energy in action. But in Post-Shiva Tantra the biija mantra for the same purpose was changed into riim&#x301;. (Ra, the acoustic root of energy, plus ii suffix, indicating feminine gender, equals riim&#x301;.) This denotes that energy is a female entity. And in still later days, when this deity Ka&#x301;lii was accepted in the Puranic Sha&#x301;kta Cult (the present custom of the worship of the goddess Ka&#x301;lii is derived from the Puranic Sha&#x301;kta Cult), the biija mantra (riim&#x301;) was further changed into klrm&#x301;: Klrm&#x301; Ka&#x301;li-ka&#x301;yae namah.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->Generally in the Post-Buddha days, during the period of the Puranic Sha&#x301;kta Cult, all the Buddhist, Jain and Post-Shiva Tantric deities were declared to be the wives of Shiva, otherwise the society would not recognize and worship them. But they have different biija mantras. In the Puranic Age, the commonly accepted practice was that the controlling deities derived from Post-Shiva Tantra were designated as &ldquo;Daks&#x301;in&#x301;a&#x301; Shakti&rdquo;, and those derived from Vajra&#x301;ya&#x301;na Buddhism were designated as &ldquo;Va&#x301;ma&#x301; Shakti&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->For instance, Ka&#x301;lika&#x301;: she was known as &ldquo;Va&#x301;ma&#x301; Ka&#x301;lii&rdquo; when worshipped in Buddhist Tantra. When an image was made of her, she would be painted jet-black; her left leg would be placed forward, her right leg behind; and there would be red patches on her left leg. This deity, Va&#x301;ma&#x301; Ka&#x301;lii, was not worshipped inside houses or in villages; she was worshipped in the cremation grounds outside the villages. These days, these deities are called by various names: for instance, Va&#x301;ma&#x301; Ka&#x301;lii, Shmasha&#x301;na Ka&#x301;lii, Raks&#x301;a&#x301; Ka&#x301;lii and Rat&#x301;antii Ka&#x301;lii. These are all deities of the Buddhist Tantra Cult, subsequently declared to be &ldquo;Va&#x301;ma&#x301; Shakti&rdquo;; and the goddesses of Post-Shiva Tantra who are now accepted in the Puranic Cult are called &ldquo;Daks&#x301;in&#x301;a&#x301; Shakti&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->But the images of Daks&#x301;in&#x301;a&#x301; Shakti are painted black or blue, or light green, and the right leg is placed in front. They are worshipped mainly at home, or inside the villages. The idea is: we may accept the deities of Buddhist Tantra, but not as family deities or village deities. Some sort of distance must be maintained. But in the case of the Daks&#x301;in&#x301;a&#x301; Shaktis, there is no such distance.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->Though both types of deity, daks&#x301;in&#x301;a&#x301; and va&#x301;ma&#x301;, were declared to be the wives of Shiva, historically speaking, they had no relationship with Shiva, because all these deities originated at least five thousand years later than Shiva. Not only that, no human structure can have four hands. They have been selected out of the sixty-four schools of Tantra. Basically, they are not human structures.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="23..32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->Let us come to S&#x301;od&#x301;ashii of these ten Maha&#x301;vidya&#x301;s. S&#x301;od&#x301;ashii is also called &ldquo;Shiva&#x301;&rdquo; &ndash; that is, &ldquo;the wife of Shiva, one whose object of meditation is Shiva&rdquo;. S&#x301;od&#x301;ashii, who was originally a deity of Buddhist Vajraya&#x301;na Tantra, was accepted subsequently in Post-Shiva Tantra with a new name, Ra&#x301;jara&#x301;jeshvarii. Later, in the Puranic Sha&#x301;kta Cult, this deity Ra&#x301;jara&#x301;jeshvarii was accepted and worshipped, though she was not very popular among the masses. More recently, towards the end of the Mughal period and the beginning of the British period, Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a Candra, the king of Nadia, introduced the worship of Ra&#x301;jara&#x301;jeshvarii, in a slightly changed form and with a new name &ndash; Jagaddha&#x301;trii. Thus Jagaddha&#x301;trii is essentially a Buddhist Tantric deity transformed from S&#x301;od&#x301;ashii.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->You should note carefully that the worship of Jagaddha&#x301;trii was especially popular in Krishnanagar. It is comparatively recent in origin, as it started in the early part of British history. Just as S&#x301;od&#x301;ashii in Buddhist Tantra was conceived  to be the wife of Shiva, Ra&#x301;jara&#x301;jeshvarii and Jagaddha&#x301;trii were also declared to be Shiva&#146;s wives. But how can they be the wives of Shiva, who lived seven thousand years ago?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->It may be a bit irrelevant to mention here, but the fact is  that the worship of Jagaddha&#x301;trii is carried out in both Krishnanagar and Chandannagar with great pomp and pageantry. An inhabitant of Chandannagar &ndash; possibly his name was Gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301; Govinda Bandyopa&#x301;dhya&#x301;ya &ndash; was the  Dewan, the Prime Minister, of Nadia. Following the example of Krishnanagar he introduced the worship of Jagaddha&#x301;trii in Chandannagar also. In art, grandeur, pomp and pageantry, Chandannagar lags behind Krishnanagar. But Chandannagar can claim supremacy in one special area: there the Jagaddha&#x301;trii idols are of gigantic size.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->Anyway, these deities, which originated in the days of medieval Jain Tantra, Buddhist Tantra and Post-Shiva Tantra, were not the wives of Shiva.

<a name="24..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The idea that Brahma comprises both Shiva and Shakti was consummated five thousand years after Shiva&#146;s advent. This is the idea of Ardha-Na&#x301;riishvara Shiva. It was imagined that Shiva was one: His  right side was like that of Shiva, and His left side was like that of Shakti, or Gaorii. One side was plain white, the other side was fair-complexioned; one side was covered with a tiger skin, the other with linen cloth; on one side there was a hooded snake, on the other, the matted locks of Gaorii&#146;s hair. This idea of Ardha-Na&#x301;riishvara Shiva [Shiva Half Man and Half Woman] represents the inner spirit of Shiva Shaktya&#x301;tmakam&#x301; Brahma. True, A&#x301;nanda Su&#x301;tram<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.24.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#24.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> was not composed then, but the idea was there deep in people&#146;s minds. This Ardha-Na&#x301;riishvara Shiva was not known in the days of Shiva Tantra, but was very much present in the days of Post-Shiva Tantra. Later on it was accepted in the Puranic Shiva Cult, but subsequently this idea disappeared from people&#146;s minds.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->I saw the figure of Ardha-Na&#x301;riishvara Shiva in one of the 108 temples on the Burdwan-Guskara Road to the west of Burdwan town. This Ardha-Na&#x301;riishvara Shiva is a personification of a philosophical idea: that Shiva and Shakti [the Supreme Cognitive Faculty and Supreme Operative Principle] &ndash; knowledge and energy - work in harmony. Energy is a blind force. A little child may die of electrocution, because electricity is merely a form of energy devoid of consciousness; being a blind force, it never stops to think that it is killing an innocent child. Thus there should be proper coordination between energy and cognition. This energy, unless guided and controlled by consciousness, may indulge in destructive activities. Thus all the actional expressions of Prakrti [the Operative Principle] are performed only on the vast body of Supreme Consciousness. If Shakti takes one step away from the body of Shiva, it may be harmful. So Ardha-Na&#x301;riishvara Shiva is a symbolic form of this creation by Shiva and Shakti. Shiva is only working as a witnessing entity and controlling the movements of Shakti with His characteristic firmness, simplicity, and love for creation.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="25..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->In those days of matrilineal order, people introduced the system of mother worship, and from that emerged the custom of can&#x301;d&#x301;ii pu&#x301;ja&#x301;, the worship of can&#x301;d&#x301;ika&#x301; shakti, the power of the group-mother. In those days the leader of a clan would invariably be a woman, a clan-mother.<!-- /block --></p>

I offer my deepest salutations to the goddess who is immanent in all created beings in the form of the Supreme Force.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Thus the people, being inspired by this idea, developed the system of mother worship in early stages of the Puranic Sha&#x301;kta Cult, in the last phase of Post-Shiva Tantra. Alongside this developed the custom of kuma&#x301;rii pu&#x301;ja&#x301; [virgin worship], just to please the future clan-mothers. So the custom of can&#x301;d&#x301;ii pu&#x301;ja&#x301; gave rise to the custom of virgin worship. One who is a maiden today will be a clan-mother in due course; so it was wise to please these clan-mothers-to-be by offering them something.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Thus we see that can&#x301;d&#x301;ii pu&#x301;ja&#x301; or kuma&#x301;rii pu&#x301;ja&#x301; was essentially a social affair, but in Post-Shiva Tantra and in the first phase of the Puranic Sha&#x301;kta Cult, a religious tinge was added to it. This is how the worship of virgins originated. Now this system has almost disappeared.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->The situation changed a great deal in subsequent periods. The matrilineal order was stopped, and the supremacy of gotrama&#x301;ta&#x301; came to an  end. Then came the age of the patriarchal system, and along with it the leadership of the clan vested in the gotrapita&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->The same tradition perpetuated itself even in the patriarchal system; that is, the head of the clan had to be kept in good humour with gifts and offerings.

<a name="25..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Can&#x301;d&#x301;ika&#x301; shakti is the can&#x301;d&#x301;a shakti, the great power exercised by the clan-mother.

We shall say more about Puranic Sha&#x301;kta later.

<a name="25..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Gan&#x301;es&#x301;a was the group-leader of prehistoric days. Some time after Post-Shiva Tantra, in the Puranic Age, a special cult, the Gan&#x301;apati Cult, arose centring around Gan&#x301;apati. You should remember that some five cults arose following the Puranic doctrine that had its origin some 1300 or 1400 years back: Shaeva&#x301;ca&#x301;ra, Sha&#x301;kta&#x301;ca&#x301;ra, Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava&#x301;ca&#x301;ra, Ga&#x301;n&#x301;apatya&#x301;cara and Saora&#x301;ca&#x301;ra.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="25..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Next is Sha&#x301;kta&#x301;ca&#x301;ra [the Shakti Cult]. According to Sha&#x301;kta&#x301;ca&#x301;ra, the static principle contained in ta&#x301;masikii shakti has to be merged in Bhava&#x301;nii Shakti, or Ka&#x301;lika&#x301; Shakti (the acoustic root for Ka&#x301;lika&#x301; Shakti is sam&#x301;). And then the mutative principle has to be withdrawn from Ka&#x301;lika&#x301; Shakti and merged in Bhaeravii Shakti (the acoustic root of Bhaeravii Shakti is sham&#x301;).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Bhaeravii Shakti means energy in action. All people want to come into contact with the mutative force. The acoustic root of energy is ram&#x301; and that for the mutative principle is sham&#x301;. People want energy supported by the mutative force so that they might enjoy name and fame. So they crave for sha + ra = shra (in the feminine gender, shrii, beauty.) Thus there was a custom in olden days for people to prefix their names with the word shrii. The old custom has fallen into some disuse: shrii is used less nowadays. But I hope that these days people will not become vishrii [ugly]!<!-- /block --></p>

When the ancient custom of group leadership &ndash; gan&#x301;a-pativa&#x301;da, vina&#x301;yakava&#x301;da or gan&#x301;es&#x301;ava&#x301;da &ndash; became converted into a cult during the Puranic Age, the idea was adopted that the group-leader was the leader of the universe. &ldquo;The Supreme Entity is the leader of our group. We will try to satisfy Parama Purus&#x301;a.&rdquo; With this sort of outlook, the Ga&#x301;na&#x301;patya Cult evolved during the Puranic Age. They are worshippers of gan&#x301;apati, the group-leader. This is the Ga&#x301;n&#x301;apatya Cult.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Last is the Saora [Sun] Cult. This cult was propagated by the Brahmans who came from Sha&#x301;kadviipa. Sha&#x301;kadviipa was the southern part of Russia, with its capital at Tashkent. The original Greek name of this area was Sacdonia. These Brahmans who migrated to India from Sacdonia did not recognize the Vedas or anything else; they were astrologers and teachers of a&#x301;yurveda. Since they cultivated the science of astrology and astronomy, they used to worship the sun-god, Su&#x301;rya. The word saora is derived from su&#x301;rya plus the suffix s&#x301;n&#x301;a, giving the sense of &ldquo;offspring&rdquo;; saora means &ldquo;one who is the worshipper of the sun-god&rdquo;. When it developed into a full-fledged cult, the idea behind it was that the sun-god, who was the creator of this world, was also the creator of the solar system; that is, all the planets &ndash; earth, Mars, Mercury, etc. &ndash; have come from the sun. The sun is their father. Similarly, the father of this universe is the sun-like Parama Purus&#x301;a; so the sun is worshipped as the Supreme Progenitor of this universe. This is the inner essence of the Su&#x301;rya Cult, which was spread by the Sacdonian Brahmans. But it was not well accepted anywhere in India; it was only accepted to a moderate extent in some places.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->These were the five main cults of the Puranic Age. None of them became widely established. Some enjoyed a limited popularity, while some barely existed at all. Some have a philosophical basis, while others do not.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="26..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Bengal is situated on the boundary line between Jambudviipa and Suvarn&#x301;adviipa [ancient names of India and Burma].  The civilization that grew along the banks of the Mayura&#x301;ks&#x301;ii, Ajaya and Damodara, later blended with the civilization which developed in the areas of Paond&#x301;ravardhana Bhukti (North Bengal), Samatat&#x301; [mid-Bengal], and D&#x301;aba&#x301;k [mostly now in Bangladesh]. A new civilization was born in Bengal &ndash; a blending of the Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h civilization of Gondwana<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.26.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#26.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> and the Gangetic civilization. That is why the people of Bengal are not exactly the same as those of northern India. The modes of worship and the priesthood system are different from those of northern India. Bengali script and intonation are also different, as is the physical appearance of the Bengalees. From their facial lineaments, one can conclude that these people are of the Bengalee stock. These are the especial characteristics of a blended civilization.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Not only that, even the type of thought varies between the different communities. The blending of the dark-complexioned people of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h with the fair-complexioned Aryans led to the formation of the Bengalee race. But this is not the end of the story. The River Brahmaputra flowed from the interior of Tibet, where its name was Sang Po (Son of a God), into India. In other words, it came from within a Mongolian<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.26.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#26.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  country. The people of Tibet are Mongolian of the Indo-Tibetan group. The Mongolians are divided into a few branches, one of them being the Indo-Tibetan group. The Brahmaputra, or Sang Po, River carries that Mongolian civilization and not the Gangetic civilization. That Mongolian civilization was criticized by the Aryans in the <I>Karma Pura&#x301;n&#x301;a</I>:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26..3"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Sarve ma&#x301;m&#x301;sarata&#x301;h mu&#x301;r&#x301;ha&#x301;h mleccha&#x301;h gobrahmagha&#x301;taka&#x301;h,<br>Kuvacaka&#x301;h pare mu&#x301;r&#x301;ha&#x301;h ete ku&#x301;t&#x301;ayonaya&#x301;h,<br>Tes&#x301;a&#x301;m&#x301; paesha&#x301;cikii bha&#x301;s&#x301;a&#x301; loka&#x301;ca&#x301;ro na vidyate.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26..4"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;They do not protect cows and Brahmans. They eat fish and meat. When they eat fish, what sort of Aryans are they? By these acts of theirs they have degraded themselves even more. Their style of pronunciation is full of defects.&rdquo;<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.26.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#26.fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The Mongolian civilization that flourished in the Brahmaputra Valley blended with the Ra&#x301;r&#x301;hii civilization and the Gangetic civilization, resulting in a new blended civilization, the Gaor&#x301;iiya or Bengal civilization. Tantra had its origin in such a blended civilization. The Ganges and the Brahmaputra meet at Goyalanda in Bengal [Bangladesh]. Thus we see that the Bengal civilization is a mixed civilization, a blending of the Gondwana civilization of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, the Gangetic civilization of northern India, and the Mongolian civilization of Tibet and China [whose access was via the Brahmaputra Valley]. That is why it is said that this Bengal civilization flourished in the border areas between Jambudviipa and Suvarn&#x301;adviipa.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->In the Bengalee race the blood of these different civilizations is mixed. Because of the blending of Australoid and Dravidoid blood, the people of Bankura, Midnapore and Purulia are mostly dark-complexioned. A certain amount of Mongolian blood is also present. The Bengalee farmers, the Ra&#x301;jvam&#x301;shiis and Cha&#x301;kma&#x301;s, have come from the Brahmaputra Valley. They are flat-nosed. As a result of the permutation and combination of these various small groups, the various castes and sub-castes of West Bengal emerged &ndash; the Brahmans, the Kayasthas, the Vaedyas, and a host of sub-castes. But the source of all these castes and sub-castes is one and the same &ndash; the blended culture of the Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, Gangetic and Brahmaputra valleys. If we take Bengal as a distinct land, it has a speciality of its own. This is due to the influence of the river valleys.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="27..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The social system of Bengal was basically Tantric, for the Vedic influence was minimal. In the higher realms of spiritual practice, the influence of Tantra was enormous; only in the middle and lower strata of spiritual practice was there some slight Vedic influence. In the local customs and social systems, and in some ceremonies conducted by women, the influence of Tantra was quite evident. Even today the avidhava&#x301;s [married, unwidowed women] of the family play a prominent role in various social observances. The [modern Bengali] word eyo<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.27.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#27.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> developed from this word avidhava&#x301; through a process of linguistic distortion.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->In the various rituals of worship, banana, betel leaves and betel-nuts were widely used. This is not in accordance with the Vedic system. The word kadalii is not used in the Vedas; but in non-classical Sanskrit, a banana is called rambha&#x301; and a plantain is called kadalii. In non-classical Sanskrit betel-nut is called guva&#x301;ka or pungiphalam. With changes in the temporal and spatial factors, various other things as well have undergone change. Bengalees are Austrico-Negro-Dravidian; thus they were fond of chewing betel leaves like the Dravids, and they used to keep a container with them for this purpose. Young people used to carry a betel-nut cracker at the time of their wedding. Bengalee women used to work in the fields and farms all day long, and after the day&#146;s work was over they would wash their hands and face and, with a daub from their collyrium casket, would make a black mark on their foreheads. The women of Bengal were quite fond of cosmetics, so they used to tuck this collyrium casket into their hair-buns. They still do this at the time of their marriage ceremony.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The ancient society of Bengal was basically Tantric. Both the young men and the young women would use the surnames of their fathers before and after marriage [i.e., the young women would not give up their surnames]. The young women would use their father&#146;s surname, suffixed by the word duhita&#x301; [daughter], even after marriage. Women, though belonging to a new gotra [clan] after marriage, were entitled to observe the funeral rites of their departed parents. They would observe ashaoca [mourning] for three days and three nights after their father&#146;s or mother&#146;s death, and on the fourth day would perform the shra&#x301;ddha ceremony [in commemoration of the departed]. In the rest of India, the rule was that the women after marriage would lose their parental gotra and as such would not be entitled to observe the shra&#x301;ddha ceremony of their departed parents. In the rest of India, women&#146;s right to make pin&#x301;d&#x301;a [offerings] to their ancestors is not recognized, but in Bengal it is recognized. In ancient days, the social life of Bengal was based on Tantra as introduced by Shiva.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="28..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->There are certain deities which are recognized in more than one school of Tantra. Some of them are recognized by both Buddhist Tantra and Jain Tantra, some by both Buddhist and Shaeva Tantra [Shiva Tantra], some by both Jain Tantra and A&#x301;rs&#x301;a [Hindu] Tantra. The number of such deities is not negligible. Originally the deity Ka&#x301;lika&#x301; of Sha&#x301;kta Tantra [Shakti Tantra] was recognized by Buddhist Tantra. There is a place called Kalka near the hill town of Simla. The place has been named after the deity Ka&#x301;lika&#x301;. There is a particular place named Ka&#x301;lka&#x301;jii in Delhi. That area has been named after the goddess Ka&#x301;lika&#x301;, who has a temple there. Ta&#x301;ra&#x301; is primarily a Buddhist deity, but in Sha&#x301;kta Tantra also Ta&#x301;ra&#x301; is a recognized deity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->In the Buddhist period there were four variations of the Ta&#x301;ra&#x301; deity: (1) Bhra&#x301;marii Ta&#x301;ra&#x301;, whose complexion was like that of a black bee; (2) Niila Sarasvatii, who was blue-complexioned; (3) Vajrata&#x301;ra&#x301;, worshipped by the Vajraya&#x301;nii Buddhists;<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.28.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#28.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> (4) Ugrata&#x301;ra&#x301;, a terrible blood-thirsty deity. In those days Bhra&#x301;marii Ta&#x301;ra&#x301; was worshipped in China, a Maha&#x301;ya&#x301;nii Buddhist country. Niila Sarasvatii was worshipped in Tibet. Ugrata&#x301;ra&#x301; was worshipped in eastern India, particularly in Gaod&#x301;adesh [approximately equivalent to Bengal]. When Vajraya&#x301;na was popular in eastern India, the deity Vajrata&#x301;ra&#x301; was worshipped. Each and every Ta&#x301;ra&#x301; deity has been recognized as a deity by Sha&#x301;kta Tantra as well as Puranic Tantra. It is claimed that all of them are Shiva&#146;s consorts. The Niila Sarasvatii of Tibet was later changed into the all-white Puranic deity Sarasvatii.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Another deity of the Vajraya&#x301;na school is Vajraba&#x301;ra&#x301;hii. This deity was widely popular in the Bhulua (or Noakhali) District of Bangladesh. Even today effigies of the old Vajraba&#x301;ra&#x301;hi deity are sometimes recovered from the earth or from the artificial ponds of that region.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The S&#x301;od&#x301;ashii deity of Sha&#x301;kta Tantra has in some places been changed into the Ra&#x301;jara&#x301;jeshvarii Devii of Puranic Tantra, in other places into Jagaddha&#x301;trii. But in certain fundamental ways all three deities  S&#x301;od&#x301;ashii, Jagaddha&#x301;trii and Ra&#x301;jara&#x301;jeshvarii are one.

<a name="29..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Many of you have surely witnessed the Ga&#x301;jana of Shiva. [The word ga&#x301;jana came from the Sanskrit root word ga&#x301;rjana. Ga&#x301;rjana means &ldquo;shouting&rdquo; or &ldquo;roaring&rdquo;.] The Ga&#x301;rjana, Car&#x301;aka and Bola&#x301;n festivals of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h are very ancient. Shiva&#146;s influence in Bengal and India even today is immense, although Shiva left his mortal frame long, long ago. Shiva is gone, no doubt, but his effulgent personality continues to influence people&#146;s minds even today. Car&#x301;aka, Ga&#x301;rjana and Bola&#x301;n are a few of the vestiges of Shaeva Tantra [Shiva Tantra] which are still to be found in Bengali society. The greatest influence of Shaeva Tantra is found in Kur&#x301;mun Village in Burdwan District, centring around the temple of Iisha&#x301;neshvara. In certain areas of Megha&#x301;laya the influence of Shaeva Tantra can still be easily traced. About two hundred years ago there was widespread influence of Shaeva Tantra in the Ha&#x301;jaun&#x32D;ga community of northern Maymansingh District. This Shaeva Tantra permeated every bit of the Bengali mind. A clear proof of this all-pervasive influence is that even today in all the Shiva-oriented festivals in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, only the line of native Bengalees participate. The so-called high-caste Bengalees, particularly the Brahmans, Ka&#x301;yasthas and Vaedyas, keep their distance from these festivals.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.29.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#29.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> When asked the reason for their aloofness, they say, &ldquo;We are not supposed to participate in these people&#146;s festivals.&rdquo; If they are still pressed as to why, they flounder for a satisfactory reply. The reason is that the so-called high-caste people have tried to mould the Shaeva religion which was inseparably rooted in the Bengal soil into the shape of the Vedic religion. But they could not altogether obliterate the influence of Shiva.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Since the days of the Yajurveda, the Aryans as well as non-Aryans have accepted and recognized Shiva. In the Vedas the word &ldquo;Shiva&rdquo; has been used in many places. Shiva could not be downgraded or underrated in any way by anyone.<!-- /block --></p>
