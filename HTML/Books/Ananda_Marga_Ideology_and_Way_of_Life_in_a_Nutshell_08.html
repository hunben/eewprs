<a name="1..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Human beings have been drifting along through constant clash and cohesions amidst endless waves of physical and psychic diversities. It is natural that various questions arise in their minds about their surroundings. None of these questions can be ignored. A question is a kind of psychic hunger. If it goes unanswered one cannot find any mental rest.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->[[Questions whose answers lie in the human psychic sphere are called apara prashna [questions pertaining to the relative world]. When different areas of the psychic realm endeavour in a persistent way to find answers to those questions, it is called material science. When the subject matter of the questions does not lie beyond the unit psychic sphere, that is, when the questions are apara prashna, the answers will be aparottara [answers pertaining to the relative world]. In the endeavour<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.1.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#1.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> to find aparottara, humans have brought about advances in material science. With the increase in complexity of the human structure, the capacity of human beings to find such answers increases, and science advances at a rapid pace.]]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Does this increased capacity to find answers to mundane questions necessarily cause the expansion of mind? Some renowned scientists have harmed society to such an extent that they can best be described as &ldquo;demons in human form.&rdquo; In order to expand the psychic arena one will have to accept an entity beyond the psychic arena as one&#146;s goal. This persistent endeavour will bring about actual psychic development, culminating in the attainment of Brahma. Any question which concerns the attempt to attain Brahma is called the supreme question or parama prashna.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The internal and external ideas of the unit mind can be understood from the following anecdote. Suppose you want to know what is lying in a particular corner of a particular house in Bettiah, a town you are quite familiar with. The quest for this type of knowledge is called apara&#x301; prashna for it concerns the relative world. The answer one receives is aparottara, and the attempt to fulfil the desire to know is the pursuit of science. When you come to know everything there is to know about Bettiah you will still know nothing about Motihari town. If your psychic arena is likened to Bettiah then to know Motihari town you will have to expand your psychic arena. Now if we call the desire to know Motihari town parama prashna, then the acquisition of knowledge about Motihari town is paramottara, (the Supreme answer) In this case, the effort to know Motihari can be called spiritual pursuit.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Brahma is beyond the periphery of unit mind. So any question regarding Brahma is parama prashna, the attainment of Brahma is paramottara, and the endeavour to attain Brahma is spiritual practice. Both types of knowledge, para&#x301; (absolute knowledge) and apara&#x301; (relative knowledge) operate within unit mind simultaneously. Hence any question regarding either para&#x301; and apara&#x301; which arises in the human mind should not be ignored. But in this discourse I would like to discuss parama prashna, the supreme question.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->The process of preparing rice from paddy comes within the scope of material science, and in thus a part of apara&#x301;vidya&#x301;. But the question as to why rice was created in the first place is parama prashna, and comes within the domain of para&#x301;vidya&#x301;, because the source from which it has emerged lies outside the periphery of paddy. The question who has infused the potentiality in rice, and why, is also beyond the psychic arena and hence parama prashna, too.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->When the shadow of the moon is reflected on the earth a lunar eclipse occurs. This is a scientific fact. Through the science of astronomy human beings have discovered the reasons for an eclipse. Astronomy is part of apara&#x301;vidya&#x301;. But who is the entity who causes the moon to cast its shadow on the earth? Astronomy cannot answer that question. It can tell us when the eclipse takes place, and how, but nothing more.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->When knowledge concerns the mundane world you look upon objects as the subject; that is external objects are your psychic object. No matter how much you study the different stages of metamorphosis an object passes through, the Supreme subject of those objects will remain unknown to you. Likewise when you are the object, then your subject remains unknown to you. Therefore in apara&#x301;vidya&#x301; you are the subject and the external physicalities are your psychic objects, but in para&#x301;vidya&#x301; the position is reverse: you and the external physicalities are the objects of another subject. The endeavour to discuss that Subject, the Knower, the Witnessing Entity is the pursuit of para&#x301;vidya&#x301;. You are not to look upon yourself as the knower or author of actions, but as the objective counter part of the Subjective Entity. The supreme entity is the final authority in the universal laboratory and you are just like a test tube in His hand.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Being His object, you must gradually identify your unit identity with the Macrocosmic identity &ndash; you must surrender totally to Him. Thus to get the proper answer to the supreme questions there is no alternative except complete surrender to Him. The effort to transform the unit identity into the Macrocosmic I is called sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->What is an object? That which is accepted or rejected by the indriyas, or that which is ideated upon, is called an object or pabulum. Brahma is thinking of you. His thought process causes the creation, preservation, and annihilation of all objects and entities. Hence you are His object and He is your subject; He is not your object. To know Him you are to throw yourself into the introversive flow of Macrocosmic imagination and bring about a union between the Entity which imagines and the entity which is imagined. To know Brahma means to become Brahma. As He is not you mental object you cannot see Him.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="1..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->All the answers to question of what and why regarding creation terminate in Brahma. The endeavour to merge one&#146;s individual authorship into Brahma is called nivrttimu&#x301;laka sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; (path of self-abnegation). The last what and the last why of all the whats and whys is the supreme question. The answer to this question is that Brahma is the Final Authority, the Supreme Knower, and all other entities are His finite expressions. This is called paramottara (supreme answer).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Human beings are animate beings, they are not animals. What is the difference between the two? Animals remain obsessed with the gratification of their crude propensities; they only try to satisfy their cruder kos&#x301;as. That is why in the minds of animals, what to speak of the supreme question, even questions related to the mundane world do not arise. Human beings, however, are (and herein lies the main difference between them and animals) mind preponderant beings. They possess the capacity of subtle thought which helps them find answers to increasingly complex questions, answers which have helped them to increase their dominance over nature. The same subtle thinking power has helped humans to attain Brahma, the Source of all psychic thought, and the final answer to all queries. It is the characteristic of all animate beings to seek joy and composure. For animals, that means the fulfilment of the crude propensities, but humans, by virtue of their developed thinking power, seek the deeper joys of life through the constant perfection of the subtle branches of relative knowledge. In the process of self-abnegation they take their psychic thinking back to its Supreme Source and get established in eternal bliss. Those for whom the pursuit of the crude pleasures of life is the be-all and end-all of existence should never be categorized as human beings.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="1..15"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->[Eating, sleeping, procreating and fearing are the characteristics of both humans and animals. But human beings have an additional characteristic &ndash; dharma &ndash; which, if unexpressed, makes the human beings no better than animals.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->The human structure has been created for the purpose of attaining the supreme answer through spiritual sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. The proper utilization of human life can be evaluated according to the degree of progress achieved in sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. If an animal does not perform Brahma sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, it cannot be criticized, because it does not possess a sufficiently developed intellect. But if a human being does not practice sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; he or she can certainly be criticized. A destitute individual should not be blamed for not donating to charity but if a wealthy person does not donate a cent for a good cause it is highly reproachable, for he or she is being miserly. People averse to spiritual practice are worse than animals and birds, or even trees and stones. If people endowed with enormous potentialities do not cultivate the mind properly, it means they are not utilizing the vast treasure that has been bestowed upon them. Thakur Narottam Das wrote,<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..17"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Krs&#x301;na bhajaba&#x301;r tare sam&#x301;sa&#x301;re a&#x301;inu<br>miche ma&#x301;ya&#x301; baddha hage brks&#x301;asama hainu.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..18"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->[I came onto the world to worship Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, but, deluded by Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;, I have become as inert as a tree.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->I would rather say that such a person is even worse than a tree. Those who misuse their human treasure are greater sinners than those who do not utilize it at all.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is a constant struggle against non-spiritual forces, a struggle against Avidya&#x301;. Those who do not wage a war against these negative forces do not have the right to live &ndash; they are as good as dead.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->It is a fact that the force of Avidya&#x301; disturbs a spiritualist more than it disturbs an ordinary person. Various situations arise in life such as material difficulties, family unrest, abundant wealth, tremendous reputation, acute financial distress, or extreme humiliation. Sa&#x301;dhakas will have to bravely confront these mundane situations as a test. They must never think in terms of retreat &ndash; it would be fatal, for the Avidya&#x301; force would stab them as soon as their backs were turned. In all circumstances one must continue the process of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; to gradually enhance one&#146;s latent psychic and spiritual power. Just as all-round physical exercise makes the body fit, similarly appropriate psychic and spiritual exercise (as a struggle against Avidya&#x301;) leads to one&#146;s psychic evolution and spiritual elevation. If one is keen to advance, if one wants to attain expansion as well as bliss in life, one must continue to struggle. Brahma sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is an all-round struggle leading to all-round progress and the ultimate goal of merging in the Supreme Source.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Life is a constant effort to restore an unstable equilibrium. Human beings endowed with enormous thinking power want to attain all-round development. To that end, along with the development of subtle thinking power, they will have to practice nivrttimu&#x301;laka sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;; they will have to strike a balance between the relative and subjective worlds. In the absence of such a balance, the process of thinking becomes disturbed again and again. There arises an irresistible desire in human beings to bring the unknown within the periphery of their knowledge, thus overcoming all obstacles. At that moment the supreme question arises. And when the supreme answer is understood their doubts and confusions are allayed.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="1..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->After rising above the level of animality a series of questions arose in the mind of the ancient humans: Why does the mind run after objects? Where does it gets its inspiration to run? And from whom? Whose inspiration causes the life force to be associated with objects?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->Psychology can provide answers as to why and how the mind performs its actions, but it cannot give any clue as to the origin of the force which sustains the mind. When an indriya (sense organ) comes in contact with an object, the nerves are vibrated. If the vibrations are compatible with the nature of the sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras, then the vibration creates pleasurable sensations in the mind. Learning by experience, living entities discover the objects from which they can derive pleasurable feelings. Endowed with this knowledge they run after objects of their choice, carefully avoiding those objects which produce painful sensations. This comes within the periphery of psychology. But the source from which the mind derives its capacity to run towards or turn away from objects is outside the domain of mind. Yet until it is fully discovered, it is not possible to understand the true nature of the mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->The next question is, Who causes life or vital energy (pra&#x301;n&#x301;ah) to activate physical objects? The word pra&#x301;n&#x301;a has various meanings. In the singular number it means &ldquo;energy&rdquo; (pra&#x301;n&#x301;a), and in the plural number it means &ldquo;life&rdquo; or &ldquo;vital energy&rdquo; (pra&#x301;n&#x301;ah). It has yet another meaning: pra&#x301;n&#x301;endriya &ndash; an intermediary state between the sensory organs and motor organs. The five motor organs keep the mind and body engaged in the action of externalization (the objects of the motor organs are called ka&#x301;rya or &ldquo;doable&rdquo;); and the five sensory organs keep the mind related to external objects through the action of internalization or subjectivisation (objects of the sensory organs are called jineya or knowable). The pra&#x301;n&#x301;endriya is an indriya which is not included in the list of the sensory and motor organs, yet with the help of all the indriyas it assists in the process of subjectivisation (its objects are called dha&#x301;rya or subjectivised). The expression of the pra&#x301;n&#x301;endriya takes place through the five internal va&#x301;yus and five external va&#x301;yus. As the va&#x301;yus themselves are included in the list of the five fundamental factors (as air), pra&#x301;n&#x301;endriya cannot be treated as a separate indriya. Material science is unable to explain why pra&#x301;n&#x301;endriya is engaged in the process of subjectivisation. Likewise, science can explain how a person speaks, but fails to explain from which source the vocal cord derives its capacity to utter sound.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->Each sense organ can only receive a certain type of inference (tanma&#x301;tra): the ears cannot receive the form inference, the eyes cannot receive the sound inference: the indriyas can only remain actively associated with their respective objects. Why this is the case and who has created this system is beyond the purview of material science. The supreme answer to this supreme question (parama uttara of parama prashna) cannot be given satisfactorily by science or philosophy.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..28"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->Shrotrasya shrotram&#x301; manaso mano yadva&#x301;co ha va&#x301;cam sa u pra&#x301;n&#x301;asya<br>Pra&#x301;na&#x301;shcaks&#x301;us&#x301;ashcaks&#x301;uratimucyadhiirah pretya&#x301;smanlloka&#x301;damrta&#x301; bhavanti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->The fundamental energy behind the gateway, the site, and the capacity of an indriya is radiated from the Supreme Entity. Concerning the universe, He is the supreme answer &ndash; He is the ear of ears, the eye of all eyes. He is the thinking power of the mind, the vocal power of the vocal cord, the visual power of the eyes, the life of all lives. To merge one&#146;s individual authority into the Absolute Entity is what is called immortality. Wherever there is actional expression there is vibrational change &ndash; either death or life. The Absolute Authority, the Supreme Knower of the cycle of life and death, is established in the highest stance of immutability.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->What sort of explanation can material science give regarding the auditory organs. At best it can explain how the sound vibration creates a congenial vibration in the auditory nerves, is transmitted to a particular point in the brain, and is heard as sound in the citta. But it cannot explain the fundamental cause of the sound. Moreover, not all vibrations created in the auditory nerve, or any particular kos&#x301;a, will necessarily be heard as sound.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->A noise made beside a corpse&#146;s ear will vibrate the auditory nerves but will not be heard by the dead person. Why? A corpse does have ears, which have the capacity of hearing, but lacks the capacity to gain knowledge by hearing.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->Any knowledge acquired by hearing has to be first substantiated by consciousness before it can be assimilated by the mind. The nature of consciousness can only be analysed by spiritual science, and the systematic endeavour to do that is called para&#x301; sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->Similarly, when the form tanma&#x301;tras of an object are reflected on the eyes it does not necessarily mean that one will perceive the object. They eye-balls and optical nerves of a dead man may continue to function, but he will not be able to see anything, for he lacks the witnessing faculty. Without the support of the witnessing faculty, the visual power of the eye-organs is ineffective. Thus the cognitive faculty is the actual eye of the eyes.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->The entity which discharges the function of thinking is called mind. The mind-stuff gives proof of its existence through perception and knowledge, but psychic thought cannot occur without His witness-ship. An object of knowledge can only be substantiated in the presence of that I-feeling. Without the I-feeling no object of knowledge can be perceived. Thus, in the absence of the final substantiating authority, the vocality of the speech organ remains unsubstantiated. When the expression of the vitality of an object wanes the entity gradually loses its vocal power. So in spite of the existence of the vocal cord and the mind, one&#146;s mental feelings remain unexpressed at the time of death. The tears in the eyes of a dying man indicate that what he wanted to communicate remained unsaid.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->The five internal va&#x301;yus which sustain the sensory organs and give them the power of expression are the objective expressions of A&#x301;tman &ndash; the aerial manifestation of A&#x301;tman. Hence A&#x301;tman is called the life of all lives. Just as the perfect state of pause of the vital airs (va&#x301;yus) enhances the perceptive capacity of the indriyas, similarly intuitional practice increases the degree of the state of pause of the vital airs. Thus the rs&#x301;i says that the Entity which is the embodiment of perfection is the only imperishable entity, whereas the indriyas and their power are all subject to perishability.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="1..38"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=38 type=paragraph -->The object cannot perceive the subject. If the eyes want to transform their subject into their object, they will have to fully identify themselves with their subject. Only then will the eyes be able to visualise the Supreme Entity.

You cannot see the entire Himalayan range at the same time because of its vastness. And this range of mountains is only an infinitesimal part of the Supreme Entity. How can you hope to ever see His vast Macrocosmic Body? The human sense organs can only perceive tanma&#x301;tras within a very limited range. Anything outside that range remains beyond the scope of perception.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..40"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=40 type=paragraph -->Waves of very high or very low frequencies cannot be received by the sense organs. So, being handicapped by such a limited capacity, how can you grasp that entity which is unlimited in all respects? Owls and moles cannot see anything in broad daylight because their eyes do not have the capacity to receive the brightness of the day. If these creatures were to deny the existence of the day simply because they cannot see it we would call it totally ludicrous. It would be equally ludicrous for ordinary people to deny the existence of the Supreme Entity because they are unable to perceive Him with their limited sense organs.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..41"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=41 type=paragraph -->That which comes within the periphery of mind is its object or pabulum. And the means by which the mind is related to its object is termed sense perception. The faculty of knowing is the faculty of consciousness, and not the faculty of mind. Whatever people say they &ldquo;know&rdquo; about an object is only their sense perception, and not real knowledge. And that sense perception remains unsubstantiated in the absence of I-feeling.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..42"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=42 type=paragraph -->Human beings cannot explain the Supreme Entity with their vocal power because that vocal power is His own objective expression. The seed of the vocal power, with all its latent possibilities, lies in Him. When that vocal power gradually unfolds into a sprout, a sapling and finally a tree, it is expressed through words. Even then it is only a minute expression of His Supreme power.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..43"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=43 type=paragraph -->In the initial stage, one&#146;s vocal power lies latent as para&#x301;shakti (primordial desire) in mu&#x301;la&#x301;dha&#x301;ra cakra. Para&#x301;shakti is an undeveloped state of verbal expression. When the internal desire of speech arises, para&#x301;shakti is awakened and starts its upward journey.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..44"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=44 type=paragraph -->At sva&#x301;dhis&#x301;t&#x301;ha&#x301;na cakra we visualise the next form of material speech called pashyanti shakti. Pashyanti shakti permits people to visualise an idea according to their inherent sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras. That is, people mentally visualise what they are going to articulate. At ana&#x301;hata cakra, madhyama&#x301; shakti transforms pashyanti shakti into mental language, which seeks to find expression through dance, gestures or speech. This inner urge to vocalise the mental language is externalized through dyotama&#x301;na&#x301; shakti, which operates between ana&#x301;hata cakra and vishuddha cakra. Finally, with the help of vaekharii shakti, dyotama&#x301;na&#x301; shakti takes the form of language. Where vaekharii shakti does not function properly, we say that the ideas are there but the person cannot find the right words to express them. In the case of mute people, vaekharii shakti cannot function properly due to a defect in their vocal cords. Inspite of the proper functioning of para&#x301;shakti, pashyanti shakti, madhyama&#x301; shakti and dyotama&#x301;na&#x301; shakti, mute people are unable to give vocal expression to their mental ideas.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..45"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=45 type=paragraph -->Even if vaekharii shakti functions properly, linguistic expression does not take place if vaekharii shakti does not come in contact with the fundamental factor (ether) carrying the sound waves. The energy which makes sound audible to other people is called shrutigocara&#x301; shakti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..46"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=46 type=paragraph -->Thus, if para&#x301;shakti is the subject, pashyanti shakti is its actional expression. If pashyanti shakti is the subject, madhyama&#x301; shakti is its actional expression. Similarly, the actional expression of madhyama&#x301; shakti is dyotama&#x301;na&#x301; shakti, that of dyotama&#x301;na&#x301; shakti is vaekharii shakti, and that of vaekharii shakti is shrutigocara&#x301; shakti. When the vocal power established in vaekharii or shrutigocara&#x301; shakti is so limited, how can one aspire to describe the Supreme Knowing Faculty.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..47"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=47 type=paragraph -->Scholars, with the help of vaekharii shakti, waste a great deal of time and energy in debates and discourses. By virtue of vaekharii shakti one can never find the supreme answer to the supreme question. A&#x301;ca&#x301;rya Shaun&#x32D;kara&#x301;ca&#x301;rya also said,<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="1..52"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=52 type=paragraph -->Brahma is that Entity whom the mind cannot think of, but from whom the thinking power of mind originates. That entity which is within the periphery of the mind, whom sense perception can grasp, is a limited entity. A limited entity in the form of an image or a idol cannot be regarded as Brahma.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..53"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=53 type=paragraph -->Brahma is your Knowing Entity, Brahma is knowledge personified. His witness-ship, His knowing faculty, is beyond sense-perception. To suspend sense perception in spiritual realization is actual knowledge, which finally leads one to the Supreme spiritual stance, that is, Purus&#x301;ottama. Bodhakriya&#x301; or knowledge is of two types: conceptual knowledge (paroks&#x301;a bodha) and spiritual knowledge (aparoks&#x301;a bodha). Conceptional knowledge is also of two types: perceptional knowledge (mati jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na) and spontaneous intuitional knowledge (sphu&#x301;rtta jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na). Perceptional knowledge is again of two types: sensory knowledge (indriyaja bodha) and acquired knowledge (sam&#x301;ska&#x301;raja bodha).<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="1..55"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=55 type=paragraph -->Sensory knowledge is of two types: direct sensory knowledge (sarala sam&#x301;yukti) and indirect sensory knowledge (tiryak sam&#x301;yukti). Direct sensory knowledge occurs when an indriya directly receives an inferential vibration and conveys it straight to the citta, thus bringing the same kind of experience in the unit mind. Suppose an elephant is standing before you. Your seeing the elephant is perception, and not knowledge, and is thus called perceptional knowledge. It is a case of direct sensory knowledge because it is acquired as a result of direct inferential contact between the indriya and its object. The second type of sensory knowledge is called indirect sensory knowledge. In this case the indriyas receive inferential vibrations indirectly. For example, by hearing a description of an elephant, or by seeing its picture, one can get an idea about how it looks. Similarly, many of you have acquired a lot of knowledge about London, even though you have never been there, through indirect perception.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..56"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=56 type=paragraph -->Acquired Knowledge<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..57"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=57 type=paragraph -->Acquired knowledge also is of two types: knowledge acquired through habitual instinct (siddha sam&#x301;ska&#x301;raja jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na) and knowledge acquired through inborn instinct (sahaja&#x301;ta sam&#x301;ska&#x301;raja jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na). Knowledge acquired through habitual instinct occurs when one receives the same piece of information again and again. For example, when you see the elephant a second time, you conclude that this second image resembles the first image, and must obviously be an elephant. When the previous knowledge is acquired by your mind a second time, it is called knowledge through habitual instinct. One&#146;s power of memory depends on this type of knowledge.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..58"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=58 type=paragraph -->Children have certain instincts which can be called inborn instincts. Inborn instinct is actually the habitual instinct carried over from one&#146;s previous life. A baby mammal learns spontaneously how to suck its mother&#146;s breast &ndash; it does not need to be taught that there is milk in the breast, or the method of sucking. It is a kind of inborn instinct. The animal-like propensities of human beings come within the category of instinct. When monkeys quarrel they make grimaces &ndash; a habit which is found in human beings. When monkeys are frightened they cling to a branch of a tree with a firm grip frightened human beings clasp their palms and start trembling.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..59"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=59 type=paragraph -->The two branches of spontaneous intuitional knowledge are: focused intuitional knowledge (aparoks&#x301;a&#x301;bha&#x301;sa) and spirituo-intuitional knowledge (aparoks&#x301;anubhu&#x301;ti).<!-- /block --></p>

However, they normally remain unseen since the causal mind has been darkened by static ignorance. The process to see some parts of the causal mind with the help of spiritual effulgence is called focused intuitional knowledge. I do not call it perceptional knowledge because it is only acquired through spiritual effulgence and not psychic probing. As the objectivities lie within the causal mind, I cannot logically call it the faculty of perceptional knowledge.<!-- /block --></p>

Only this is real knowledge. All other knowledge is the shadow of knowledge&#8230; insubstantial knowledge. The pursuit of perceptional knowledge has no absolute value.<!-- /block --></p>

Even if microcosms could hear the totality of sound, they would still not be able to recognize the Cognitive Faculty. Sound, whether limited or unlimited, is an expression of the Cognitive Factor in His limited form. Hence sound cannot be the absolute factor. The divine sound, On&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra is not Brahma, but an expression of Brahma in the form of sound (Va&#x301;k Brahma). We may also call On&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra the primordial phase of Sagun&#x301;a Brahma (Brahma in His creative stance), but we can never describe it as being Non-attributional Brahma.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="1..72"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=72 type=paragraph -->Like all other actions, the flow of life (pra&#x301;n&#x301;akriya&#x301;) is also systaltic. During the state of pause the object ideated upon comes within one&#146;s sphere of knowledge. Vital energy (pra&#x301;n&#x301;ah), which is the coordinated functioning of the ten va&#x301;yus, is an expression of Purus&#x301;a in the form of the aerial factor under static bondage. It is for this reason that vital energy, by its action, cannot attain Brahma as its object of ideation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..73"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=73 type=paragraph -->So through intellectual pursuit it is not possible to attain Brahma as one&#146;s object. What is normally called the cultivation of knowledge is nothing but the acquisition of perceptional knowledge which produces a lot of vanity. Unfortunately nothing substantial is gained which could even begin to justify such inflated pride. In the mundane world there may be a vast difference between the greatest intellectual and the biggest fool regarding the acquisition of perceptional knowledge, but when it comes to real knowledge there is hardly any difference between them at all. To attain real knowledge one will have to probe deep within one&#146;s self.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..74"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=74 type=paragraph -->The lofty ideas of books and dry hay carry the same value. To acquire true knowledge, that is, self knowledge, one will have to ideate on the Supreme Faculty. There is no other way.<!-- /block --></p>

Wherever there is actional expression there are invariably three factors: kartha&#x301;(doer), karma (doing) and karana&#x301; (the connecting link between kartha&#x301; and karma). In the case of creation, Brahma is the doer and the microcosms are His doings or objects of creation. He is the subject and the rest are His objects. As the Supreme Subject He knows His objects, but His objects do not know Him. You know the moon, but the moon does not know you. Your object is, in effect, His object too. All are His manifestation bound by the limitations of Prakrti. That is why, He knows what you know, and not only that, He knows what you do not know. You do not know yourself, but He knows you. You cannot point to any one of His finite manifestation in this quinquelemental world and declare that it is the Supreme Entity. Each finite manifestation is only an infinitesimal part of the vast Macrocosmic body expressed within the bounds of a particular time and space. The rivers and springs, the hills and valleys, the seas and oceans, and the earth itself are nothing more than His finite objective manifestations, perennially proclaiming His infinite glory.<!-- /block --></p>

In order to know Brahma as the Knowing Entity one will have to merge one&#146;s self in His subjective bearing. There is no other way. The objective expression of the microcosm is created by the binding faculty of Prakrti; hence, in order to merge in His subjective bearing by discarding one&#146;s objective counterpart, the bondages of Prakrti must be broken. Microcosms will have to fight against the static influence of Prakrti. The supreme culmination of this microcosmic struggle is the ensconcement in the field of supreme cognition. The self-seeking disciples of the rs&#x301;i realized that it is futile to show off one&#146;s egoism by declaring that one has attained Brahma.

The so-called pandits know nothing of Brahma, whereas the so-called illiterate people may be successful in attaining Him.<!-- /block --></p>

That is why only foolish people declare themselves Brahmajin&#x32D;a&#x301;na(one who knows Brahma). Just as a worm-eaten flower cannot be presented as an offering, similarly, a mind eaten by ego cannot be offered to Purus&#x301;ottama. Hence, before merging one&#146;s mind in Him one must sincerely endeavour to destroy all the worms of the mind.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="2..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->A sincere spiritual aspirant understands that Parama Purus&#x301;a is the Prati bodhasattha&#x301; (Omni-telepathic Entity). What does this mean? Mind is the perceiver and the apparent knower of objects. The subjective emanations from this perceiving mind are finally reflected in the Cognitive Faculty. Hence the Cognitive Faculty is called the Omni-telepathic Entity. Only when psychic emanations are reflected on the cognitive plate, can one acquire some kind of intellectual knowledge. The Omni-telepathic Entity is like a mirror. When a spiritual aspirant, after relinquishing the authorship of actions, is established in this Omni-telepathic Entity, he or she attains immortality. As this Entity is free from the bondage of mind, obviously He is not bound by spatial, temporal and personal bondages, and hence is not subject to waxing or waning. For waxing and waning to occur a third entity is required. But as there cannot exist any other entity except that Infinite Knowing Entity, no external pressure can bring about any change in Him. He is beyond the scope of mutability, beyond birth and death. Rather, He is the Source of mutability, the source of birth and death of all finite objects. But He Himself is undecaying, undying.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->The nature of reflection depends upon the nature of the object placed before the reflecting place.

Who accept Him as an object of genuine devotional sentiment? The answer is that they will certainly attain immortality. The manifestation of the Supreme Entity will be clearer in those who are free from the vanity of intellectual knowledge, who love Him as the soul of their soul. The more elevated they become, the more their existence will glitter with spiritual effulgence. Brahma is love personified, Brahma is unbounded. One who is in deep love with Him will steadily advance towards the infinite from the world of finitude.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Accelerated progress towards the Supreme occurs in the flow of Pratisain&#x32D;cara with the help of the force of Vidya&#x301;. Though Vidya&#x301; is non-existent in the Supreme stance, it takes microcosms right to the door of the Supreme Stance. Hence it is said, Sa vidya&#x301;ya&#x301; vimuktaye. &ldquo;Vidya&#x301; is that which leads to complete emancipation&rdquo;. In the pursuit of knowledge the Supreme Entity is your Omni-Telepathic Entity, and in the path of devotion He is the big &ldquo;I&rdquo; of your small &ldquo;I&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>

However the one who advances only a short way along the path of knowledge is soon assailed on all sides by the laments of the parched desert. No matter what the nature of one&#146;s sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; might be, one will have to practice sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; in this world; one will not get the opportunity after death. It is up to you to choose between the path of divinity and the path of animality. But remember, the highest fulfilment in life lies in Brahma sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. The attainment of immortality lies in the pursuit of this path. Only through Brahma sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; can one properly evaluate life and attain genuine progress. The fulfilment of a bud lies in its unfoldment, not in its withering. Those who spend life in the pursuit of limited mundane objects allow the bud of their lives to wither, and regress along the path of negative Pratisain&#x32D;cara to suffer the eventual miserable plight of becoming as inert as bricks, stones or iron, what to speak of dogs or cats. This process of crudification will lead to the total annihilation of their latent humanity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->An intelligent person should not follow the path of annihilation, but the path of spiritual unfoldment.

<a name="2..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->The common masses cannot easily realize that they are moving towards their annihilation. So intelligent people should point out their mistakes and inspire them to move along the path of progress. Just as motorists  are warned about a road under repair with the signboard &ldquo;Danger ahead&rdquo;, similarly those moving along the wrong path should be warned of the impending danger by the well-wishers of society and guided along the proper path. To render this service is everyone&#146;s bounden duty.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->All petty thoughts and narrow sentiments disappear from the mind of a person moving towards the Supreme Entity. Brahma includes all; therefore to love Brahma means to love all. So Brahma sa&#x301;dhakas see Brahma in everyone and everything, loving all equally. They look upon all countries as their own country, all languages as their own language, and all races as their own race.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->Even the worms and insects that infest hell are as dear to them as the greatest of human beings.

This is the true stance of immortality.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="3..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Today&#146;s subject of discourse is &ldquo;The Macrocosmic Stance and Human Life&rdquo;. Human beings not only want expansion, but undisputed authority in the process of expansion. Not only do they seek the Supreme shelter, they want to bring that shelter within their reach. Out of this desire to attain the Supreme, out of this longing to become as vast as the Supreme, they discovered the science of intuitional practice. But this discovery was not easy. They had to cross numerous hurdles such as ritualistic observances, isms, doctrines and cults. Their discovery was the reward for their long-cherished desire to attain the Supreme. Without the desire for expansion, they would have never tried to realize Brahma even while remaining in the ocean of Brahma. The entity closest to them would have remained far away.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->It is the innate desire of human beings to seek expansion, to yearn for the Supreme. They want to attain Him for their personal happiness, self-preservation, and attainment of bliss. The owner of a hundred acres of land wants to own a hundred and fifty acres; a millionaire wants to become a billionaire. But if the desire for self-expansion or happiness is limited to the mundane world, clashes of interest and various hindrances will certainly arise before long. It is not possible to enrich oneself at the expense of others for very long.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Due to the defective mentality, &ldquo;Let others live in destitution, but I want immense wealth; let others be landless, but I want landed property&rdquo;, many people had to suffer in the past, and many are suffering even today. This mentality begins with violence and exploitation and ends with violence and exploitation. Violence begets violence. If a person becomes a billionaire today by exploiting the masses, tomorrow the same masses, driven to irrepressible violence by poverty and hunger, will snatch away the billionaire&#146;s accumulated wealth and raze his honour to the ground. The endeavour to expand should not centre around finite objects of the mundane world. Whether the mind accepts it or not, every limited resource of the world should be treated as the property of the entire humanity. The collective wealth of the human race should not be amassed by a few individuals.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The human desire for expansion is an innate desire. It cannot be suppressed, but must be given full scope for expression. Since desire for expansion is harmful for society when limited to the material sphere, it should be diverted to unlimited objects. No matter how much people acquire from this unlimited stock, it will not create conflict amongst individuals. While running after the acquisition of finite objects, the dissatisfied human beings of the past realized one day that their minds were looking for something which had hitherto eluded them.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Psychic objects are limited by nature, but the Entity who is the Subject of the mind is unlimited. The final establishment in that Entity alone is the real expansion, the Supreme fulfilment of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. One glorious day, while moving along the path of Pratisain&#x32D;cara towards the Supreme Subject, human beings attained Him. Actually, it not proper to say they &ldquo;attained&rdquo; him, because one only attains an object with the help of the mind. When one attains the Supreme Subject the small-I loses itself completely in Him. Neither the mind nor words can attain Him; they merge in Him. One does not &ldquo;get&rdquo; Him; one becomes one with Him.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->In the process of expansion clashes occur between the boundary of one object and that of another object. In the case of mundane objects it is impossible to expand without encroaching upon the boundaries of other objects. This clash over boundaries brings out the worst in human beings &ndash; narrow-mindedness, greed, casteism, provincialism, nationalism, etc. &ndash; as they strive to establish themselves in the empire of the universe. Those who are bound by these sentiments deny the existence of the Absolute Entity. Even if they set out with a goal before them, their love for crude desires grows so intense that their goal becomes totally obscured. Being preoccupied with their own self-interests, they lose their capacity to look towards their goal. Such people are called moha&#x301;ndha or blindly infatuated.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Those who are moving will have to think constantly of their goal, not of their movement, and certainly not about the probable obstacles they may encounter along the way. If one thinks of obstacles, the obstacles themselves become one&#146;s goal, and the actual goal is relegated to the background. Hence in the sphere of Brahma sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; only Brahma is the goal, only Brahma is to be meditated upon. Spiritual aspirants must not entertain any thought about the impediments which may arise at the time of meditation, but focus their minds upon the supreme culminating point. To establish a heavenly kingdom in this mundane world human beings will have to fight tirelessly against the internal and external demons. But this does not mean that the demons should become the object of ideation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Brahma Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is entirely different from jad&#x301;a sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; (the pursuit of matter) because it focuses on the goal and not the clash. Spiritual aspirants who struggle to expand the self should never compromise themselves with those forces which try to thwart the process of supreme expansion. The path of self-expansion (dharma sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;) is the path of valour. There is no place for inertness or cowardice on such a path.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->In the social sphere, the perennial struggle of human beings should not be undertaken individually but collectively. Those who provide leadership in the social struggle must be established in yama and niyama (code of yogic morality). Such people I call sadvipras.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->How will sadvipras be created? They will be created in the continued endeavour to expand the self. By reciting holy scriptures or by acquiring a few Sam&#x301;skrta titles, one cannot succeed in spiritual pursuit. Brahma does not care who is of noble descent or high caste. The important thing is to continue sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. One&#146;s life can only be properly evaluated in the light of that struggle.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..11"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Na&#x301;sti tes&#x301;u ja&#x301;tividya&#x301;ru&#x301;pakulakriya&#x301;di bhedah.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->The struggle in collective life, with the sadvipras in the position of leadership, will continue endlessly. Sadvipra after sadvipra will come: the torch carried by one will be handed over to the next. But the sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; of individual life is not endless &ndash; it culminates in the attainment of Brahma. Those who believe that they must first attain success in individual life before participating in the collective struggle will not succeed. They will never bring expansion in their individual lives if they ignore collective welfare. To be worthy of being sadvipras, individuals will have to concentrate on both intellectual and social development. Otherwise, no matter how lofty the word dharma might sound in theory, it will remain as a big hoax in the practical field. All spiritual aspirants must strive to become sadvipras, and that, too, from this very moment. If a person who takes bribes starts an anti-bribe campaign he will become an object of ridicule. One will have to make an earnest endeavour to develop oneself thoroughly; mere rhetoric will not do. Only those endowed with sincerity and devotion can be called righteous, and can successfully propagate dharma. For the propagation of dharma government help is not required.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Those who want to thwart the introversial phase of the Cosmic Cycle in individual and collective life are dominated by Avidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301;. In the struggle against Avidya&#x301;, if the thought of Purus&#x301;a (Cognitive Faculty) is kept awake in one&#146;s mind, Avidya&#x301;&#146;s influence will start to wane. In individual life the six enemies (ripus) and eight fetters (pa&#x301;shas) are collectively known as the force of Avidya&#x301;. For the preservation of the physical body, and to keep social tyrants under control, these pa&#x301;shas and ripus need to be maintained, but the mind must not be allowed to become their slave. Those who want to destroy them would be better off committing suicide. Sincere spiritual aspirants must keep their pa&#x301;shas and ripus firmly under control, making them subservient to their disciplined mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Though the Avidya&#x301; force is expressed in various ways, its expression in the human mind can be divided into five categories: avidya&#x301;, asmita&#x301;, ra&#x301;ga, dves&#x301;a, and abhinivesha.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="3..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->When human beings become blindly infatuated with objects of enjoyment and lose all common sense, when they become totally absorbed in the pursuit of finite objects forgetting the infinite, they make the error of believing that the impermanent is permanent. This useless pursuit exhausts all their vital energy. They forget that no single object of the world enjoys permanence. Some educated people say, &ldquo;Well, I may not live long enough to enjoy all the pleasures of life, but my grandchildren will.&rdquo; This yearning for the finite is caused by avidya&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Under the influence of avidya&#x301;, people become so infatuated that they forget the difference between pure and impure; and so greedy that they eat rotten meat, choose to forget that alcohol is bad for health, and even try to prove the unholy as being holy by force of logic. Some people claim that eating meat and drinking alcohol are a part of dharma sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;; and some state they eat meat to maintain their health and strength.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->Lost in blind pursuit for finite objects, people fail to realize that the pleasure they derive will actually bring more sorrow in the future. An alcoholic does not understand that heavy drinking severely damages the liver: an opium addict does not understand that the temporary pleasure derived from the drug gradually benumbs the nervous system. This mistaking pain to be pleasure is caused by the influence of avidya&#x301;. Those who succumb to this influence can be likened to a dog chewing on a dry bone in a burial ground. The dog thinks that the blood oozing out of its jaws comes from the dry bones and greedily bites even harder, further damaging its jaws. The poor animal wrongly thinks sorrow is happiness.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Under the influence of avidya&#x301; people believe that the finite objects created by static Prakrti are their own. They think, &ldquo;my horse, my son, my daughter, my wealth,&rdquo; and believe that with these objects they will live eternally. But the fact is, all these limited objects will desert them after sometime. Nothing that can be called one&#146;s own will remain.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->To understand avidya&#x301; properly, one must pursue the path of  spiritual practice. Without sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; one cannot escape the devouring jaws of avidya&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="3..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->Asmita&#x301; literally means to arrogate the full authorship of an action. The actual authorship of action, no matter what that action may be, does not belong to the sensory and motor organs. In the absence of A&#x301;tman (the knowing entity) the organs become totally ineffective. If the image an of elephant is reflected on the eyes of a corpse, it will not be able to see it. A corpse has no A&#x301;tman, no witnessing entity, and thus no capacity to see. People often believe that mind is everything, and thus commit the error of taking the mind to be the author of actions. This error is called asmita&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->Asmita&#x301; causes human beings to confuse drkshakti (witnessing entity) with darshanshakti (faculty of sight). Sa&#x301;dhakas must remember that the mind and the indriyas can only perform their allotted duties when Consciousness is reflected on the unit mental plate.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->By forgetting that the Cognitive Faculty is the witnessing force behind the faculty of seeing, behind the existential I-feeling, people become worse than animals.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="3..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->The human mind constantly needs pabulum. A mind devoid of any pabulum attains the non-attributional stance. But sleep, senselessness or death cannot be regarded as the non-attributional stance. From the viewpoint of psychology, sleep and senselessness are almost similar. They occur when the ka&#x301;mamaya and manomaya kos&#x301;as of the mind remain suspended due to some reason or other. In both cases the mind still has an object. In the case of death, the psychic power (reactive momenta) is detached from the nerve cells of the brain and hence the mind cannot perform actions.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->In the wakeful and dream states human beings seek to acquire objects with the help of their entire mind. Under the influence of avidya&#x301; they think that they will derive pleasure from eating a certain type of food, or become more comfortable by wearing certain clothes, or get some satisfaction by playing a certain role. This tendency to run after certain objects in the pursuit of pleasure is called ra&#x301;ga or blind attachment.<!-- /block --></p>

They do not understand, or sometimes refuse to understand, that nothing in this universe except infinite Brahma can give them permanent happiness.

There are some objects or ideas upon which people cannot fix their minds because, according to their sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras, they find it painful to do so. They are reluctant to analyse whether those objects or ideas are really painful or tormenting. When an attempt is made to divert the mind from those objects or ideas to escape the anticipated pain it is called dves&#x301;a. Most of the wars and battles of the world are the result of either ra&#x301;ga or dves&#x301;a. Dhritarastra&#146;s love for Duryodhana and his animosity towards Bhiima was one of the causes of the Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata war.<!-- /block --></p>

They deliver eloquent discourses on dharma and morality in meetings and symposia, yet knowingly indulge in sinful deeds in their personal lives, even though they are aware of the dreadful consequences of their sinful actions. This suppression of Vidya&#x301; is also an expression of Avidya&#x301; shakti in one&#146;s personal life.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..38"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=38 type=paragraph -->Incidentally, I remember a story. Once there was an alcoholic who realized, by studying good books and generally cultivating his knowledge, that addiction to wine is a very bad habit indeed. Under the influence of Vidya&#x301; shakti he even made a vow to give up the habit of drinking on the next auspicious day. When that auspicious day came he marched resolutely past the wine bar he used to frequent. When he was ten steps past the wine bar he said in self-appreciation, &ldquo;Well done, mind. You are so firm in your resolution to kick the habit of drinking that you&#146;ve succeeded in taking ten steps past the wine bar. Congratulations! Today I will reward you for your courage. Let&#146;s open two bottles of wine!&rdquo; After that the alcoholic continued to visit the wine bar regularly and drink large quantities of wine. This story is a beautiful illustration of abhinivesha or psychic obsession.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..39"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=39 type=paragraph -->From where does abhinivesha derive its impetus? From the acquired sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras of human beings.

<a name="3..40"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=40 type=paragraph -->The life or vital energy of human beings is the coordinated functioning of the ten vayus. As these vayus are one of the fundamental factors (the aerial factor) in the extroversive flow of the Cosmic imagination, it can be said that vital energy is created and vibrated by the Cosmic imagination. Thus, human life is no more than a mere bubble in the vast ocean of Consciousness. The influence of Avidya&#x301; on the human mind, the dominance of one&#146;s individual flow, and microcosmic reactive momenta, are only relative factors. No one can advance by disowning the vast Macrocosmic flow.<!-- /block --></p>

The more human beings advance towards the authorship and witness-ship of the Supreme Entity, the more they understand the expression of the Cosmic flow. The more they proceed to the Cosmic Stance (bha&#x301;va), the more effulgent their existence becomes and the more the darkness of ignorance fades. To shake off the influence of Avidya&#x301;maya&#x301; one must take shelter in Him. To count beads or practice ritualistic worship without directing one&#146;s mind towards the Supreme Entity is of no use.

<a name="3..46"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=46 type=paragraph -->The beginning, the middle and end of dharma sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is to rush towards Him, to channelize all the positive and negative propensities of mind toward Him. Spiritual aspirants will not destroy the six ripus (not even ka&#x301;ma or physical longing) but will utilize them for their benefit. When utilized as aids for spiritual progress they will do no further harm. So-called jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nis may fight the propensity of krodha (anger), but devotees will utilize  it to fight staticity. They will shatter the meanness and pettiness of the mind through psychic strength and fearsome temper. So-called jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nis claim that the propensity of greed (lobh) is harmful, but devotees disagree &ndash; they nurture greed to attain Him. Jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nis abhor vanity or pride (mada), but devotees say that the only object of pride in their lives is Parama Purus&#x301;a. Jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nis detest the propensity of blind attachment (moha), but devotees say, &ldquo;I am already in love with Him. I have a blind attachment for attaining my Lord&rdquo;. The propensity of jealousy (ma&#x301;tsarya) as a ripu is very bad, but a spiritual aspirant will never take it as harmful. In this way spiritual aspirants keep their vision fixed on Brahma. Those who fail to focus their entire entitative existence on Him, those who do not flow towards the Macrocosmic Nucleus of the Cosmic Cycle, realize one day that everything in their lives has become futile.<!-- /block --></p>

This force of inspiration keeps all the receptive minds connected to Purus&#x301;ottama, the Supreme Source of all emanations, and motivates them to rush towards Him.

<a name="4..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Today I would like to discuss mata and patha [opinions regarding the Supreme, and paths to the Supreme]. Mata means a certain style of thought, so we have to see where the action of thinking originates, develops, and culminates; and we have to see on what the action of thinking depends. When someone says, &ldquo;It&#146;s my opinion, my personal view,&rdquo; where does the action of thinking lie and how does it take place? Thinking depends on the unit mind; it originates in the unit mind and is maintained in the unit mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->In the absolute sense what is the unit mind? The Cosmic Mind reaches a state of maximum crudification through sain&#x32D;cara [the phase of extroversial movement], and thereafter starts returning to Its original abode through pratisain&#x32D;cara [the phase of introversial movement]. The small &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling that gradually develops within crude matter is called the unit mind. Although the Macrocosmic Mind is the Supreme Controller of everything in this universe, It does delegate a certain degree of control to unit minds as they increase in complexity in the phase of pratisain&#x32D;cara. Therefore the unit mind can be called a primary sub-centre in a physical structure within the Macrocosmic Mind. Unit minds have to act within the periphery of time, place, and person, as created by the Macrocosm, and their different styles of action are called mata [opinions]. Just as the unit mind is dependent on time, place and person for its creation, maintenance and annihilation, each of its expressions also depends on a particular time, place and person. This is why opinion carries its highest value in a particular time, place, or individual, and loses its value, or becomes altogether non-existent, when any of these three relative factors changes. Opinions do have some value in both individual and collective life. But when one is dealing with the Absolute Entity, who transcends the boundaries of time, place and person, does one&#146;s opinion have any value? No, in this case an individual opinion has no value whatsoever. Thus the statement Yata mata, tata patha<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.4.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#4.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> is not logically tenable. An opinion held by a particular individual or group regarding the social sphere, the economic sphere, or the political sphere does have some value, but to attempt to express an opinion concerning the absolute sphere would be simply ludicrous.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->An opinion is a psychic object. An opinion of a particular person is, in effect, an object of the object of the Cognitive Faculty [the objects of the Cognitive Faculty are minds and the objects of minds are opinions]. So how can an opinion become the subject of the Supreme Subjectivity? How can it know the Knower of the known? One&#146;s opinion in this regard has no value &ndash; for anyone to have an independent opinion about Parama Purus&#x301;a is meaningless.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Regarding Parama Purus&#x301;a the unit mind can do only one thing: become one with Him as the Supreme Subject. The unit mind must accept Parama Purus&#x301;a as its object, and run towards Him. Even this proposition is illogical in the absolute sense. Rather it should be said that the unit mind will have to return to its own subject. This should be the only movement, movement towards the Parama&#x301;gati [literally, the &ldquo;Supreme Terminus where the movement, or journey, of finite entities culminates&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Thus a unit mind may hold many opinions about the mundane world, but no opinion regarding the spiritual world. The path which leads to supreme bliss is a singular one; there is no second path. The path is one, and only one.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->If this universe is considered as a circle, its nucleus is the blissful Purus&#x301;ottama to which every point on the circumference is connected. If any microcosm located on any point of the circumference wants to reach the Nucleus, he or she will have to move with Cosmic ideation, floating on the divine waves of bliss. From no matter what point on the circumference one measures the distance to the Nucleus, that radius will always be the same. This radius is termed the a&#x301;nanda ma&#x301;rga [the path of bliss]. So the a&#x301;nanda ma&#x301;rga is the only ma&#x301;rga. The spiritual path has nothing to do with the opinions of any particular individual or of any group of individuals, because Parama&#x301;tma&#x301; cannot be attained by opinions.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..7"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->The Three Stages of Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->In Ananda Marga there are three particular stages of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; which can be fused into one, or can remain separate: Sha&#x301;kta, Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;aviiya, and Shaeva. True spiritual practice is a happy combination of these three stages. In endeavouring to reach the Nucleus of the Cosmic Cycle from any point on the circumference, one must develop each stage, for each has an equal importance. To understand Ananda Marga one has to understand the significance of the three stages.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Who is a Sha&#x301;kta? A Sha&#x301;kta is one who is determined to awaken his or her cognitive faculty and fight against the negative influence of the static principle. Such a person struggles ceaselessly against psychic impurities and physical ailments in individual life, and against social evils and economic disparity in collective life. A Sha&#x301;kta is not afraid of the crushing load of unhappiness in life, and never surrenders to pessimism, but fights against the miseries of life with revolutionary zeal. This is the criterion of a Sha&#x301;kta. Such dauntless fighting spirit wins the laurels of victory for a Sha&#x301;kta one day, a victory which is never possible through coaxing and cajoling. Of course, as a war strategy, there can be a temporary truce, but nothing more than that.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->In Indian mythology there is a story about the Sha&#x301;kta, Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava (or Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;aviiya) and Shaeva mentalities.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.4.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#4.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> Perhaps you have heard that Shiva was first married to Sati, or Dakshayani. Shiva was at that stage of the story like a soul in bondage. When Sati heard from Narada that King Daksha, her father, was staging a grand sacrificial ritual, she became determined to attend it. Shiva objected to her going and tried all He could to dissuade her, but in vain. Sati went to her father&#146;s house. Up to here in the story, Prakrti has been dominant, and Purus&#x301;a dormant, as is the case with a microcosm in bondage.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Then next, Shiva&#146;s latent valour awakened. Totally absorbed in His own self, He placed the dead body of Sati on his shoulder and began to move throughout the universe. Everyone saw that the inert Prakrti had found her place on the shoulder of Purus&#x301;a. This was the sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; of Shiva. Shiva at this stage was the perfect Sha&#x301;kta, performing sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; to attain victory over Prakrti.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.4.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#4.fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> This is the first stage of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; &ndash; Shakti sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, to establish one&#146;s supremacy over Shakti, or Prakrti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Then Prakrti undertook the practice of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; in order to make Herself subservient to Shiva. Prakrti wanted Purus&#x301;a to be Her Lord. Or as the mythological story goes, Sati took rebirth as the daughter of Himalaya and Menaka and was called Parvati; she then underwent tremendous penance to get Shiva as her husband, while Shiva refused to even look at her. So Prakrti suffered immense hardship to attain Purus&#x301;a, but Purus&#x301;a remained totally indifferent. At this stage Shiva was the perfect Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava [Vaishnavite], for he had no concern at all for Prakrti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Then finally Parvati, with the help of the gods, got her wish to be Shiva&#146;s consort. Prakrti became sheltered in Purus&#x301;a. But since Shiva meanwhile did not give up His original non-attributional stance, He was the ultimate Shaeva [Shaivite].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->This beautiful allegory has immense educational value. To recapitulate: In the first stage of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; one has to become a Sha&#x301;kta in order to acquire adequate shakti [power]. In the second stage Prakrti is willing to take the shelter of Purus&#x301;a, but the sa&#x301;dhaka is indifferent, and remains absorbed in the flow of Cosmic bliss &ndash; so this is Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, the endeavour to throw oneself into the current of Cosmic bliss and float towards the supreme goal. [And in the last stage one practises Shaeva sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->In the Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava stage sa&#x301;dhakas remain totally unconcerned as to who is Purus&#x301;a and who is Prakrti. Their only desire is to become one with Brahma in the flow of bliss. They do not make a hair-splitting analysis regarding fight or non-fight, for they know they will remain absorbed in the Cosmic flow of bliss for eternity. This is the true spirit of Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. &ldquo;Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u&rdquo; means &ldquo;all-pervading&rdquo;, &ldquo;expansive&rdquo; &ndash; so the proper etymological meaning of &ldquo;Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava&rdquo; is &ldquo;universalist&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Vaishnavite bha&#x301;va [spiritual stance] can be divided into two stages: liila&#x301;bha&#x301;va and nityabha&#x301;va. When a sa&#x301;dhaka&#146;s mind oscillates [among different experiences] along the paths of the sain&#x32D;cara and pratisain&#x32D;cara of Brahma and becomes inextricably merged with Its panoramic expressions, that condition is called liila&#x301;bha&#x301;va, and the sa&#x301;dhaka&#146;s blissful feeling is called liila&#x301;nanda. In liila&#x301;bha&#x301;va the sa&#x301;dhakas&#146; entire existences become vibrated with the vibrations of the Cosmic dance, causing them to burst out in dance, laughter, tears  and song. But in nitya&#x301;nanda there is no such expression as this. Purus&#x301;ottama [the Nucleus Consciousness] is the supreme source of the countless forms and flows that emanate during liila&#x301;bha&#x301;va; but His own stance is nityabha&#x301;va [eternal and unchangeable].

<a name="4..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->The more that unit beings advance towards the Supreme Being, the more their physical and psychic bodies (which are made of Macrocosmic stuff) advance from crude to subtle. In the first phase of Macrocosmic imagination, the Cognitive Faculty moves from subtle to crude. One atom or particle comes in closer proximity to another atom or particle. The name of this process is sain&#x32D;cara. And when these particles begin to drift away from each other or become powdered down, thus going beyond the scope of sense perception, it is called the process of pratisain&#x32D;cara. When an object becomes more condensed it should be understood that the Macrocosmic mind-stuff is decreasing its inter-molecular gaps. This causes an object to gradually come within the periphery of sense perception. When there comes to be a high degree of diversity in the structure of the condensed object, it requires a self-activated psychic factor for its preservation, maintenance and destruction. This psychic entity (the mind) is created as a result of clash due to inter-molecular proximity. Thus it can be said that mind emerges as a result of clash within the material structure. But it must not be forgotten that matter is nothing but a condensed state of Macrocosmic mind-stuff. What we call matter is not crude matter as such, but a metamorphosed form of Consciousness.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->The unit mind finds its expression through clash. This process of clash causes the psychic atoms to get powdered down and expanded to such a degree that the mind expands into the universe, transcending the limits of the small &ldquo;I&rdquo;. This continous unfoldment and expansion of the mind through constant clash and cohesion is brought about mainly by Prakrti. The unit mind finds natural problems which it must solve, such as procuring food, finding accommodation, and rearing children &ndash; not to mention simply staying alive. The more difficult these obstacles are, the more scope the mind gets to unfold. The struggle to overcome obstacles is the primary factor in the development of the mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->But there is also a secondary factor, and that is the influence of a more-developed mind on a less-developed mind. Domestic animals such as dogs and cats get ample scope for accelerated development due to their contact with the human mind. The company of human beings often accelerates their progress more than do the natural forces which present them with obstacles to overcome. So if a dog&#146;s mind can develop into a monkey&#146;s mind, and a monkey&#146;s mind into a human mind, in the normal course of evolution, then a dog that is in constant contact with a human being may experience a tremendous intellectual growth and be reborn as a human being, bypassing the stage of a monkey. Such galloping changes do take place in the process of animate evolution; and comparatively undeveloped creatures, if advantaged with human contact, can establish themselves in human form in a shorter period than can comparatively developed creatures deprived of human contact.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->When a microcosm reaches a stage of expanded consciousness, having made considerable psychic progress due to natural clashes or due to contact with more-developed minds, and is able to control the psychic propensities as opposed to being subservient to them, it is called manus&#x301;ya [human being]. The term manus&#x301;ya, or ma&#x301;nus&#x301;a, means &ldquo;mind-preponderant being&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->With the development of the mind, the physical structure becomes more complex. It can be put in another way: the physical structure grows in complexity in order to serve as a proper vehicle for the expression of a developed mind. When the psychic activities are channelized in different directions or engaged in combatting various obstacles, the brain, the medium of the mind, is bound to become more complex.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->Similarly, undeveloped human beings can make rapid psychic progress due to natural clashes or due to contact with great personalities. The greater the application of psychic energy to a unit being, the more its physical stuff is transformed into mind-stuff. This helps it attain greater psychic expansion, and consequently the greater reflection of Cosmic Consciousness on the unit mental plate.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->Unit beings have attained a human body after evolving from the stage of animality through structures of ever-increasing complexity.

Some have just evolved from animal life to that point, in the process of pratisain&#x32D;cara; while others have reverted to that point from a more developed human level, due to their mean thoughts. If they continue to allow mean thoughts to dominate their minds, they will degenerate to the even cruder stage of inert matter, becoming bricks, stone or wood. Just as animals have no scope to elevate their thoughts or practise spirituality, similarly human beings who make their minds animal-like through animalistic thinking are unable to pursue spiritual practices. Even after receiving spiritual initiation or receiving an education, they behave like ignorant fools. But those who are by mentality undeveloped human beings, but not animals, will if they receive initiation carry on spiritual practices, and will if they receive education behave like intelligent people.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->Spiritual initiation and education will bring about mental development in those who have degenerated to the level of animality, but it will be next to impossible for them to develop spiritually.

If we remember this fact, if we work for the well-being of all, then undeveloped human beings will be able to develop their spiritual potentiality when they come in contact with us.

That is, those who do not follow the spiritual path may perform harmful actions at any time. Even those whom society respects as intelligent or learned may, in reality, be no better than &ldquo;polished satans&rdquo;, or what the scriptures call &ldquo;demons&rdquo;. Our modern society is full of such people. They talk about universalism like parrots. They have no defined ideology in their individual and collective lives, and merely dedicate themselves to the deception of the human race as they strive to serve their petty self-interests by any means, fair or foul.

<a name="4..33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->Human beings perform two types of action: pratyayamu&#x301;laka [original actions] and sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ramu&#x301;laka [reactive actions &ndash; actions prompted or goaded by sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras]. Original actions are performed under one&#146;s own initiative, and thus one is fully responsible for them. Every original action is a new action. It may represent an extension of the experience of the past, but it is not a reaction. And the actions which human beings are compelled to perform as reactions to their previous actions are called reactive actions. In other words, original actions constitute efforts, and reactive actions constitute the resultants [of the original actions].<!-- /block --></p>

But you should remember that this was destined to happen to you as a reaction to one of your previous bad actions. So even though you asked that man politely, you had to undergo psychic pain.

<a name="4..35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->When people rob others, or indulge in hypocrisy, or cheat people, or indulge in tall talk day after day, they are committing original actions.

When his son dies he laments, &ldquo;I haven&#146;t knowingly done anything wrong. Oh, Lord, why have you given me such severe punishment.&rdquo; But God did not give him any punishment &ndash; the deep sorrow he felt at the death of his child was the result of his past original actions.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..36"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph -->The moment sa&#x301;dhakas start spiritual practice they must surrender all their original actions to Brahma so that they do not have to endure the reactions.

<a name="4..39"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=39 type=paragraph -->Reactions in requital to past actions normally occur more in a spiritual aspirant&#146;s life than in an ordinary person&#146;s life. The reason is that when all original actions are surrendered to Brahma, there remain only the reactive actions. The reactions may be good or bad [according to whether they are resultants of good or bad original actions]. But think about how many of the deeds you performed before coming to the path of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; were good and how many were bad. To tell the unpleasant truth, ninety-nine percent of your deeds were bad. Hence it is often the case that sa&#x301;dhakas have to suffer much more from bad reactive momenta than get to enjoy good ones. It can even be said that the more one suffers from reactions, the more one is progressing along the path of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..40"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=40 type=paragraph -->Of course, the requital of the reactive momenta may possibly be pleasurable instead of painful; it all depends upon the nature of one&#146;s actions. In either case, the more one surrenders one&#146;s actions to Brahma, the shorter will be the period of requital caused by the reactions. In this case the intensity of the requital will be greater than normal; but this is a good sign, because intense requital means the exhaustion of the requital within a short period.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..41"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=41 type=paragraph -->Suppose you have incurred a loan of a thousand rupees. If you repay the loan in monthly instalments of one rupee it will take you a thousand months to clear the loan. One rupee being such a small amount, this will hardly cause any suffering at all. But if you want to free yourself from the debt quickly, you will have to pay a larger amount every month, which will obviously cause more suffering. Likewise, if one does not feel the need to be freed of one&#146;s reactive momenta quickly, one can undergo less affliction, but then one may have to wait ten or twenty lives to exhaust all the reactive momenta. Moreover, within those ten or twenty lives one will probably undergo psychic degeneration, and due to one&#146;s mean actions imbibe new reactive momenta.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..42"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=42 type=paragraph -->Hence genuine sa&#x301;dhakas always strive to be relieved of their acquired sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras as early as possible; therefore they surrender completely to Brahma.

The mundane obstacles, the friends and foes, merge in the Vaishnavite sa&#x301;dhakas&#146; world of blissful ideation. With whom will they fight? They feel that the entire universe is an unbroken divine play composed of Ra&#x301;dha&#x301; and Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. In this stage there is a clear dominance of action and devotion. Vaishnavite sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is a blissful flow indeed.

Some people You place on golden thrones as kings, others You throw into the street to beg from door to door with outstretched begging bowls. You are my joy, You are my sorrow.

They feel the divine joy of the Cosmic play. They never retreat, for having passed through the Sha&#x301;kta stage they have acquired immense courage and valour. One who has not been an ideal Sha&#x301;kta cannot be an ideal Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava. In the final stage of the Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava cult, sa&#x301;dhakas offer their greatest treasure &ndash; their mind &ndash; to Brahma, and in exchange for this supreme gift expect nothing in return. In the absence of mind they cannot enjoy the sweetness of the divine play any longer. At that supreme stage of surrender liila&#x301;nanda is transformed into nitya&#x301;nanda.

Progress on this journey is made through pratya&#x301;ha&#x301;ra yoga. As all spiritual aspirants are aware, the goal of pratya&#x301;ha&#x301;ra, dha&#x301;ran&#x301;a&#x301;, and dhya&#x301;na is the attainment of sama&#x301;dhi.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.4.fn6"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#4.fn6">6</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> Pratya&#x301;ha&#x301;ra is the conscious endeavour to withdraw the mind from mundane qualities and attractions &ndash; easier said than done!

Suppose you see one of your colleagues taking a bribe, and think, &ldquo;Had I not been an Ananda Margi I could have also earned some extra money in this way.&rdquo; This shows that your propensity of greed is not fully controlled, but as you are keen to control it, you have adopted the Ananda Marga way of life.

<a name="4..56"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=56 type=paragraph -->In vyatireka, the second stage, some propensities may be controlled at one time, but uncontrolled at another time.

After delivering an eloquent lecture he or she will say, &ldquo;All the credit goes to Brahma. It is only by His grace that I could deliver such a lecture,&rdquo; but in his or her heart will think, &ldquo;What an excellent speech I gave today.&rdquo; This is called vyatireka.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..57"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=57 type=paragraph -->In the ekendriya stage, the propensities are brought under control, no doubt, but not permanently.

Hence this stage does not represent complete pratya&#x301;ha&#x301;ra either, because the pa&#x301;shas and ripus [fetters and enemies of the mind] are not totally controlled.<!-- /block --></p>

<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="4.fn2"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.4.fn2">2</a></b>)  In this chapter the author&#146;s focus is psychological: the author discusses the different mentalities characteristic of Sha&#x301;ktas, of Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;avas and of Shaevas. From a philosophical point of view, the different recognized schools of the Hindu tradition &ndash; five in all, known as the Paincopa&#x301;sana&#x301; &ndash; are distinguished on the basis of their different deities, or objects of meditation. In Shaeva&#x301;ca&#x301;ra (Shiva Cult) one&#146;s object of meditation is Shiva. In Sha&#x301;kta&#x301;ca&#x301;ra it is one of the representations of Shakti, or Prakrti. In Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava&#x301;ca&#x301;ra it is Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u. In Saora&#x301;ca&#x301;ra it is Su&#x301;rya (the sun or the sun god), and in Ga&#x301;n&#x301;apatya&#x301;ca&#x301;ra it is Gan&#x301;apati (Ganes&#x301;a). In all the cults, the more subtle practitioners understand that their particular deity is a representation of the infinite Brahma. &ndash;Eds</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="4.fn3"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.4.fn3">3</a></b>)  The story goes that King Daksha&#146;s main purpose in staging the sacrificial ritual was to humiliate Shiva, for he never forgave Shiva for marrying Sati against his wishes. When Sati realized this, and saw that her pleas to stop the harsh vilification of Shiva were falling on deaf ears, she threw herself into the fire. Shiva received immediate news and rushed to the spot to try to save her from being totally consumed by the flames. &ndash;Eds.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="4.fn4"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.4.fn4">4</a></b>)  I.e., the two experiences, nitya&#x301;nanda and nirvikalpa sama&#x301;dhi, are no more different from each other than are the two bha&#x301;vas, or stances, from which the two experiences respectively come. &ndash;Eds.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="4.fn5"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.4.fn5">5</a></b>)  Jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na, karma and bhakti are forms of spiritual practice which emphasize, respectively, discrimination, selfless action, and devotion. &ndash;Eds.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="4.fn6"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.4.fn6">6</a></b>)  Pratya&#x301;ha&#x301;ra, dha&#x301;ran&#x301;a&#x301;, dhya&#x301;na and sama&#x301;dhi are the last four limbs of as&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301;m&#x301;ga [eight-limbed] yoga. &ndash;Eds.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="4.fn7"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.4.fn7">7</a></b>)   Offering of mental colours to the Lord, also known as Guru pu&#x301;ja&#x301;.  &ndash;Eds.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="4.fn8"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.4.fn8">8</a></b>)   An indriya is a sensory or motor organ, together with its respective nerves, nerve fluid, and site in the brain. &ndash;Eds</p>

<a name="5..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The centrifugal movement that starts from the Macrocosmic Nucleus and moves towards crudity is called the process of Sain&#x32D;cara. What influence does the centrifugal force of Sain&#x32D;cara exert on the microcosmic body and Macrocosmic body?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->In the process of Sain&#x32D;cara (the first half of the Cosmic cycle) the centrifugal force acts on the Cognitive Faculty, bringing Its unit expressions under ever cruder bondage. This centrifugal force of Sain&#x32D;cara results in the creation of a centripetal force in material structure. The more the process of Sain&#x32D;cara advances, the greater its momentum, and the stronger the internal force of attraction within the structure. When a molecule comes in contact with another molecule the inter-molecular gap decreases. This is what we call crudification.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->So when the centrifugal force is greater than the centripetal force in the Cosmic body, in the microcosmic body the centripetal force is greater than the centrifugal force. Microcosms are attracted to the Supreme Nucleus with the same amount of centripetal force as the Macrocosmic body is distanced from Its Nucleus due to the centrifugal force, and vice versa.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->When the centripetal force is greater than the centrifugal force in the Cosmic Cycle there emerges mutual repulsion amongst the component units of the material structure which leads to increasing subtlety. There arises a love and attachment for the Cosmic Mind and a limitless thirst for Supreme Bliss. In this stage the Microcosm is subjected to the centrifugal force which causes atoms and molecules to be mutually repelled. The strength of the force with which atoms are repelled from each other is the same as the strength of the force with which they are attracted to the Macrocosm.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->When the centrifugal force of the Cosmic Cycle in Sain&#x32D;cara remains dominant, one particle comes in closer contact with another particle &ndash; their relative distance decreases. This decrease in the inter-molecular and inter-atomic gaps causes physical objects to be further crudified. In this process of gradual crudification a stage comes when the Cosmic Mind can hardly be called &ldquo;mind&rdquo;, but, having come within the scope of sense-perception, should be called &ldquo;bhu&#x301;ta&rdquo; or fundamental factor. The fundamental factor which first comes into being is a&#x301;ka&#x301;sha or ethereal factor. The crudest stage of the Cosmic Mind and the subtlest stage of the ethereal factor are virtually indistinguishable.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->The ethereal factor is also changeable, having variations in its degree of subtlety and crudity. Just as the subtlest stage of the ethereal factor is no different from the crudest stage of the Macrocosmic Mind, similarly, the crudest stage of the ethereal factor is nothing but the subtlest stage of the subsequent aerial factor. It is due to the decrease in the gaps between particles that the ethereal factor, at a certain stage, comes to be known as the aerial factor.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->With the decrease in internal gaps there is a simultaneous increase in internal friction. If the strength of the centrifugal force of the Cosmic Cycle is less than the centrifugal force that first emanated from the Macrocosmic Nucleus, the centrifugal force generated within the material structure remains less than the centripetal force. As a result, in spite of the internal centrifugal force within the material structure, the extro-internal force remains dominant. It is for this reason that the internal force within the fundamental factors remains dominant during the process of Sain&#x32D;cara. When the centrifugal force exerts all its power in the process of gradual crudification, there is a simultaneous increase in the internal friction or centripetal force within the material structure. A stage comes when the centripetal and centrifugal forces are evenly balanced. That is the nadir point of crudification.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->From the aerial factor evolves the luminous factor, from the luminous factor evolves the liquid factor, and from the liquid factor evolves the solid factor. When the particles of a structure come in close proximity to each other as a result of the action of the centripetal force(which is a reaction to the centrifugal force), the internal centrifugal force becomes less than the extro-internal force, and the process of crudification continues, but only to a certain level. A stage comes when the centrifugal and centripetal forces become evenly balanced. As soon as that stage is reached the Macrocosmic centripetal force increases. This results in a decrease in the intensity of the centripetal force within the material structure giving scope for greater internal friction. This is the state of maximum crudification.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->With the increase in the degree of crudification of the fundamental factors, the clash within microcosmic structures gradually increases. To describe this clash I have used the term sam&#x301;ghars&#x301;a (friction). In the flow of Sain&#x32D;cara this increase in friction and the process of evolution of an object are inseparably linked. But in the stage of Purus&#x301;ottama, when Prakrti lies dormant, and the process of evolution is unborn, there is no friction because the fundamental factors have not yet come into being.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->The factor in which the degree of friction becomes extreme is the solid factor. The crudest stage of the liquid factor is the subtlest stage of the solid factor. What is the crudest stage of the solid factor? I shall explain this a little later.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->In this connection it should be understood that the philosophical term bhu&#x301;ta is different from the scientific term &ldquo;element&rdquo;. The Sam&#x301;skrta equivalent for element is maolika pada&#x301;rtha. Philosophically, bhu&#x301;ta means that which has been created, that which is recognized as a factor (tattva). In the world there are many elements, but only five bhu&#x301;tas, five fundamental factors.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->The fundamental factors are determined by certain characteristics. Those factors that have the capacity to carry the inference of sound come within the scope of the ethereal factor. Those factors which carry two inferences, sound and touch, are known as the aerial factor, which is not visible to the eye. The luminous factor carries three inferences, sound, touch and form, and due to its greater crudity comes within the scope of visibility. The nebulae and the sun belong to this luminous factor. The crudest stage of the aerial factor and the subtlest stage of the luminous factor are the same. Of course, there are variations in the degree of crudity within the same fundamental factors. Thus although the sun and nebulae both belong to the luminous factor, the sun is much cruder than the nebulae.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Let us return to our previous discussion about the crudest stage of the solid factor. Each factor is going through the process of gradual metamorphosis in the flow of sain&#x32D;cara. Even no two molecules are uniform as far as the degree of crudification is concerned. Of all the fundamental factors, the solid factor is the most perceptible because it contains five inferences, and its degree of friction is the highest. What is the resultant of the extreme friction within the solid structure? The resultant is the gradual increase in the inter-molecular gap. This increase is inspired by the force of Macrocosmic attraction (the sentient force which enhances the strength of the centrifugal force, as a reaction, within the material structure) causing the conversion of matter into mind. But the mind that first originates in the process of introversive movement is a very undeveloped stage of mind. Thus the direct resultant of the crudest solid is the crudest mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->This resultant is the first stage of Pratisain&#x32D;cara. Mind does not emerge from the solid factor under all circumstances. For the preservation and proper functioning of the unit mind, the solid factor as well as the other four factors have to be metamorphosed into the chemical compound we call the human body. For the preservation of this human body, food, drink, air and light are necessary. It is not possible for the mind to evolve in an environment which does not have an adequate supply of these essential requirements.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->When the solid factor does not get the opportunity to be converted into mind, it is automatically further crudified in the process of Sain&#x32D;cara. Instead of calling excessively crude matter the direct resultant of crudification of matter, it is better to call it the indirect resultant of the crudification of matter. Of course this extremely crudified object is nothing but matter. And the direct effect of matter is mind. So when materialists observe that mind comes out of matter, they are right. But remember, matter itself comes out of Macrocosmic Mind: both are composed of the same stuff.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Now what is the function of this unit mind that evolves from solid matter? To meet the primary needs of the physical body, the fundamental factors have to bring about necessary changes in structural complexity. Although the mind draws its sustenance from the organic structure, its function is also to preserve the organic structure. In the initial stage this is the main function of the mind. This primary stage of mind is called ka&#x301;mamaya kos&#x301;a. Eating, procreating, and so on, are the functions of the ka&#x301;mamaya kos&#x301;a. The minds of undeveloped unicellular organisms are nothing more than ka&#x301;mamaya kos&#x301;a. How do the higher kos&#x301;as evolve out of the ka&#x301;mamaya kos&#x301;a? The mutual conflict between the physical components of the body (which follow the laws of Sain&#x32D;cara) and the mind (which follows the laws of Pratisain&#x32D;cara) is called physical clash. That physical clash forms the subtler manomaya kos&#x301;a out of the stuff of the ka&#x301;mamaya kos&#x301;a. But where mind cannot evolve from matter, matter undergoes further crudification and finally explodes in the process of Jadasphota. Jadasphota causes the internal force of the material structure to be suddenly released, and generates tremendous heat in some portion of the universe. This is why I once said that the universe as a whole will never meet with thermal death.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Physical clash leads to psychic progress. But is absolute psychic progress possible through physical clash alone? No. Apart from physical clash, psychic clash and attraction of the Great are necessary. The mind that evolves from the solid factor as a result of physical clash gradually takes the form of manomaya kos&#x301;a from the initial stage of ka&#x301;mamaya kos&#x301;a. If there is only physical clash, the kos&#x301;as higher than manomaya kos&#x301;a cannot be developed. Extreme physical clash can only mature or perfect the lower kos&#x301;as.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Human beings who live in hostile or uncongenial environments are far more dynamic than those who live in areas where the struggle for existence is minimal. Those who maintain their existence through greater physical clash are said to be engaged in sha&#x301;kta sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. But physical clash alone can only lead to a certain level of psychic progress. To progress beyond that psychic clash is required.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->Through study, analysis, verification, listening to scriptural discourses, constant contemplation, and meditation unit minds acquire psychic power from the Cosmic Mind. To produce friction or commotion in others&#146; minds by proper application of these psychic powers is called psychic clash. Those who are mentally inert, who are blindly attached to old worn-out ideas, will no doubt refuse to accept new ideas, but questions will nevertheless arise in their minds. Constant psychic clash will cause their blind attachment for the old to gradually weaken.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->When the ancient people were faced with immense obstacles, they would perform sacrificial ceremonies for the propitiation of the gods, for they were not acquainted with the scientific methods to surmount those obstacles. They thought that there was no difference between the smoke produced by burning ghee in fire and the clouds in the sky. They were unaware that the former is composed of unburnt carbon-particles of ghee and the latter are basically a combination of hydrogen and oxygen which appears to be blackish under certain circumstances. Even today if people misuse ghee by burning it in a sacrificial fire, they certainly do it out of total ignorance.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->If people&#146;s blind attachment to sacrificial rituals and love for outmoded customs are intense, they will not disappear when confronted with logical arguments or shaken by the first jolt caused by psychic clash. But if one can create a suitable environment of constant psychic clash their blind attachments are bound to disappear. Some people believe that the fragrance of the sacrificial smoke purifies the air and kills germs. This is not true. On the contrary, the increase in the amount of carbon particles makes the air more impure. A highly pungent smell is much more effective in destroying germs. Thus, due to the impact of constant psychic clash, people eventually understand the defects of old systems and ideas. Through physical clash the ka&#x301;mamaya and manomaya Kos&#x301;as can be developed, and through psychic clash the higher kos&#x301;as can be developed.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Those who want to avoid the cultivation of knowledge hardly get any opportunity for psychic clash, and hence the higher kos&#x301;as of his mind do not get any scope for development. It is through psychic clash that the psychic field gets properly tilled, thereby increasing its fertility. All living beings evolving in the phase of Pratisain&#x32D;cara benefit from this psychic clash.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Both physical clash and psychic clash accelerate psychic progress. The rat which escapes from the trap never makes the mistake of getting caught again; the fish which frees itself from the fisherman&#146;s hook never bites the bait again. Physical clash develops the ka&#x301;mamaya kos&#x301;a and, as a consequence, the instinct to survive. A city ox walks confidently along a busy street in Calcutta, but if a village ox were made to walk along the same road, it would become crazy.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->Psychic clash enables one to make rapid psychic progress along the path of Pratisain&#x32D;cara and deepen one&#146;s thinking capacity. The psychic clash caused when undeveloped minds come in contact with developed minds further accelerates the rate of psychic progress in the flow of Pratisain&#x32D;cara. A monkey is more developed than a dog, having advanced further along the path of Pratisain&#x32D;cara. Yet a pet dog, benefiting from the psychic clash resulting from its contact with human beings, becomes more advanced in knowledge than other dogs, and even other monkeys. A monkey trained by human beings is far more advanced intellectually than a wild monkey. If a monkey becomes intellectually developed its brains cells will have to be kept engaged in more complicated activities to give proper expression to its evolved thinking. This will result in a change in the size of its brain. If its brain outgrows the size of the cranium, it will require the more developed body and brain of a human being. Similarly the dog which makes tremendous psychic progress after being trained by a human being will require a more developed structure to express its increased psychic potentialities. In such circumstances there will be a rapid progress in the phase of Pratisain&#x32D;cara. Such rapid change can also take place in the phase of Sain&#x32D;cara through scientific efforts. So you understand that psychic clash is not at all negligible. Rather, with the cultivation of knowledge, microcosms can make galloping progress along the path of Pratisain&#x32D;cara.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->One may conclude theoretically that a highly evolved monkey and the most backward human are almost similar. An underdeveloped human being will make rapid progress after coming in contact with more advanced human beings. The same applies to cows, horses, dogs and monkeys. After coming in contact with evolved human beings they get the scope to be reborn as human beings.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->Animals lack a brain developed enough to contain a greater intelligence, and thus do not have the capacity to perform spiritual practice. This is not to say that animals are not entitled to spiritual practice. On the contrary, had their bodies and brains been more developed, they would have certainly had the opportunity to perform spiritual practice. The characteristics of a physical structure are determined by the nature of the brain. So by looking at the physical structure of a living being one can have a rough idea about the degree of its intellect or intelligence.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->As some psychic propensities have a tendency to flow towards matter, even evolved human beings can be transformed into inert matter if they fall prey to those psychic propensities. Hence all human beings should carefully avoid bad company. Due to mean psychic ideation the human mind may imbibe animal tendencies or may even degenerate to a stage cruder than that. Once the mind degenerates to the inertness of stone, the physical body will also be converted into stone. In Indian mythology there is a beautiful story illustrating this point. Due to her mean thoughts Ahalya was turned into inert stone. However, by the grace of Parama Purus&#x301;a, she was later reconverted into a human being.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->When the mind evolves in a physical structure, it becomes responsible for the maintenance of that structure. That initial state of mind, the ka&#x301;mamaya kos&#x301;a, is only concerned about the needs of the physical body. Thereafter, in the flow of Pratisain&#x32D;cara, one&#146;s unit mind comes in contact with other unit minds which leads to psychic clash. In this way the hopes and aspirations, the pains and pleasures of ones own mind becomes interrelated to and interdependent on other minds. This mutual relationship is a kind of psychic clash. And even greater psychic clash occurs when people try to derive mutual benefit through rational intellectual pursuit. Therefore in our society the cultivation of knowledge is an indispensable necessity. Those who avoid good company (satsaun&#x32D;ga), study of good books (svadhyaya), uplifting discourses and healthy analyses cannot develop any kos&#x301;a (layer of mind) higher than ka&#x301;mamaya kos&#x301;a. Animals dominated by the ka&#x301;mamaya kos&#x301;a find pleasure in snatching away morsels of food from others mouths, and in depriving others of their right to live, because they look upon this world with a narrow body-centred outlook.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->With the development of higher kos&#x301;as through the process of psychic clash the existential feelings of human beings do not remain confined to their physical bodies alone but spread to those around them. Initially they think about the welfare of the members of their own families, but with the gradual evolution of their minds, they see themselves as members of a global society and become actively engaged in promoting the well-being of all. This gradual process of evolution leads the unit mind towards the Macrocosmic mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->The ensconcement in the Macrocosmic stance is not possible through morality alone. &ldquo;I will speak the truth, I will not harm anyone&rdquo; &ndash; This simple morality alone cannot take human beings very far along the path of progress. So-called moralists can all too easily degrade themselves under the nefarious influence of evil company. The only way to advance is to follow the path of vigorous spiritual practice. To repeat high-sounding words of morality like a parrot, while cherishing narrow sentiments within one&#146;s mind, will not take one far.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->To effect psycho-spiritual expansion constant spiritual practice is a must. I have called this spiritual practice &ldquo;attraction of the Great&rdquo;. Through physical or psychic clash absolute self expansion is not possible; even the awakening of hiranmaya kos&#x301;a is not possible. Of course physical clash can take a person a certain distance, but not to the final destination. I have already said that only when attraction of the Great is supreme can the centrifugal force within the microcosm become strong enough to lead an entity to liberation or salvation. Where there is no attraction for the Great, no matter how intellectual or moral a person might be, his or her entire existence will be dominated by the kamamaya kos&#x301;a. Out of narrow self interest, such a person will betray low morals at every step in live. Those who have no love for the Supreme may be considered as humans today, but tomorrow will surely degenerate into animals like dogs, and the day after into inert bricks or stones.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->Now a question a may arise: Since animals cannot act independently, and thus cannot discriminate between virtue or vice (only developed human beings can do that), why do some animals live in constant pleasure while other animals undergo constant pain? Why are some dogs treated lovingly, fed tasty food, and driven around in cars, their heads stuck out of the window to enjoy the fresh breeze; while other dogs are forced to eat out of dustbins to survive, or are shot by hunters&#146; bullets, or are run over by passing cars? The answers to these question have already been given: in most cases the psychic clash caused by these incidents, under the direction of Prakrti, helps to accelerate the dogs&#146; psychic development.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->In the attraction of the Great lies the secret of greater well-being. You will have to rush towards the fundamental Source of the entire creation. You will have to merge your individual stance in the Absolute Stance of the Supreme Transcendental Entity. You will have to advance at a speed greater than that of ordinary microcosms in the Cosmic Cycle.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->Having accelerated your speed, if you embrace the force of Vidya, rejecting Avidya&#x301;, you will certainly reach the Macrocosmic Nucleus. If Non-attributional Brahma and not Purus&#x301;ottama is accepted as the goal one will transcend the Cosmic Cycle. This transcendence is not affected by the centrifugal force of Macrocosmic Nucleus, because that force is confined to the periphery of Saguna Brahma. One will have to transcend the Cosmic Cycle with the help of the Cognitive Force. To become one with the Macrocosm is called liberation, and to transcend the periphery of the Cosmic Cycle and becomes one with the Non-attributional stance is called salvation. The Tangential Entity which connects the path of liberation and the path of salvation, who, although infinite, comes within the domain of the finite, is called Ta&#x301;raka Brahma. Whether you want to become one with Purus&#x301;ottama, or one with the Non-attributional Stance, or one with Ta&#x301;raka Brahma, you will have to continue your spiritual pursuit, you will have to surrender yourself to the force of attraction of the Great.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->The one performing sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; must be ever vigilant to ensure that the small &ldquo;I&rdquo; cannot hinder spiritual progress. The ego that can so easily develop on the path of knowledge and action may not develop at all on the path of devotion. A spiritual aspirant must take the help of devotion at the final stage of spiritual attainment. If ego remains, even on the path of devotion, the best way to counteract it is to superimpose Cosmic ideation on the small I-feeling through devotion. Intelligent people should understand that the objects their ego uses as its support may not last long. The vanity of power of today will disappear tomorrow; the leader of today may be thrown out of office tomorrow (those who clamour for a chance to garland them today will not even cast a glance at them tomorrow); a man swollen with the pride of scholarship today may become mentally abnormal tomorrow &ndash; people will point at him and say, &ldquo;See that lunatic over there, he used to be great scholar&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..36"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph -->The vanity expressed by the so-called civilized human beings of today is extremely dangerous. These people hide the cruder propensities of the mind under the cloak of sweet words and decent behaviour. They are more harmful to the well-being of the human race than the so-called uncivilized humans, because they are hypocrites. The defects of the uncivilized humans pale into insignificance before their abominable hypocrisy. The uncivilized humans of the past may have killed twelve people at most in the battles they fought with bows, arrows, sticks and spears, but the so-called civilized human beings of today kill millions of unarmed, innocent people indiscriminately with their dreadful and lethal weapons. Human society of today is being exploited by the so-called civilized people. Such people should not make themselves look ridiculous by claiming otherwise.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..37"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=37 type=paragraph -->All entities must advance along the path of progress. This evolution will lead to the expansion of the psychic arena and, ultimately, liberation. This struggle for liberation is the struggle against those forces which attempt to thwart one&#146;s psychic expansion. These are one&#146;s enemies. Through meditation and contemplation one must surrender oneself at the altar of the Almighty, merging one&#146;s finite identity into the Infinite. Only by surrendering one&#146;s mind to the vast Macrocosm and becoming one with the Supreme Consciousness can one attain final salvation. The struggle for salvation is the struggle against those forces which strive to prevent one&#146;s total self surrender to the Supreme.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="6..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Whenever there is clash or conflict within any structure, whether subtle or crude, it develops increasing subtlety. This applies to both psychic clash and physical clash. The more subtle the crude mind becomes as a result of internal clash, the greater its spiritual awakening. It is written in <i>Carya&#x301;carya Vinishcaya</i>: <!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..3"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Tula&#x301; dhuni dhuni a&#x301;n&#x32D;sure a&#x301;n&#x32D;su<br>A&#x301;n&#x32D;su dhuni dhuni niravara sesu.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..4"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;When cotton is spun, its fibres become more subtle. As a result of further spinning, that is, further physical clash, its fibres become so subtle that they are almost invisible to the eye.&rdquo; In the dexterous hand of <i>Prakrti</i> [the Supreme Operative Principle], the solid factor is metamorphosed into mind, and mind is later converted into Consciousness.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..5"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Physical Clash<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->In the initial stage of <i>pratisain&#x32D;cara</i> [the process of introversion], there is only physical clash. The unit mind &ndash; the mind whose flow is connected with matter through the workings of its vital energy &ndash; is generated as a consequence of extreme physical clash. Thus we see that in the phenomenal world the primordial cause of creation is physical clash, and due to this clash animate entities are generated out of inanimate matter. <!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Though the term &ldquo;non-matter&rdquo; is taken to mean the <i>a&#x301;tman</i> [unit consciousness], the <i>maha&#x301;ttattva</i> [existential &ldquo;I&rdquo;] and the <i>aham&#x301;tattva</i> [doer &ldquo;I&rdquo;], a subtle analysis can lead us to the understanding that only <i>Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma</i> [the Non-Qualified Supreme Entity] qualifies as non-matter. Clash transforms matter into mind-stuff and mind-stuff into non-matter. Whenever the objective part of the Macrocosm is converted into non-matter, it is no longer Its objective part but becomes Its subjective part. <!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Although the unit mind appears to originate from matter, in the absolute sense it evolves from the Macrocosmic Mind. Because the matter from which it appears to originate is nothing but physical vibrations emanating from the Cosmic (Macrocosmic) Mind. And what (based on appearances) we call physical clash is, from the Cosmic point of view, direct Macrocosmic psychic clash, and as created within the microcosm, indirect Macrocosmic psychic clash. When what we call physical clash is mostly superseded by direct Macrocosmic psychic clash due to close proximity to the Cognitive Entity, a material object comes to be termed a conscious entity. When that conscious entity is further assailed by the direct waves of the Macrocosm, it can be called a human mind. Thus the human mind is created as a result of physical and psychic clash in the relative world and Macrocosmic psychic clash in the absolute sphere. The appropriate structure for the human mind is selected by the waves of the Macrocosmic Mind out of the five fundamental factors. That structure is the human body. <!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->So in human beings there is both physical and psychic clash. Due to the impact of both, humans gradually advance along the path of progress. But inanimate objects are only subjected to physical clash, because in them mind has no expression. <!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Even though both physical and psychic clash help to create progress, human beings can generally be divided into two categories: those who welcome psychic clash and those who prefer to undergo physical clash. The first category we can call <i>bha&#x301;vava&#x301;diis</i> [&ldquo;idealists&rdquo;] and the second category <i>bhogava&#x301;diis</i> [&ldquo;materialists&rdquo;] . I intentionally do not use the word jad&#x301;ava&#x301;diis<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.6.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#6.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> to describe the latter. <!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->It should be remembered that both the materialists and the idealists are <i>sa&#x301;dhakas</i> [spiritual aspirants], the only difference between them being their goal. A subtle analysis will reveal that both categories harm society. In order to advance, human beings will have to maintain a balance between the two, and will have to keep the idea of the Supreme fixed before them as their goal in the midst of physical clashes. <!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->In the relative sense, only a kind of physical clash exists in the <i>sain&#x32D;cara</i> [extroversial] phase of <i>Brahma Cakra</i> [the Cosmic Cycle of creation] whereas in the <i>pratisain&#x32D;cara</i> [introversial] phase all three exist: physical clash, psychic clash and the attraction of the Great. Now, in the case of these clashes, what clashes against what? Whatever the clash, whether physical or psychic, it exists between two forces: <i>Vidya&#x301;</i> [introversial force] and <i>Avidya&#x301;</i> [extroversial force] &ndash; negative and positive. Suppose in the phase of <i>sain&#x32D;cara</i> the negative <i>Vidya&#x301;</i> force is fixed at forty and the positive <i>Avidya&#x301;</i> force is fixed at sixty. The resultant force will be twenty in favour of <i>Avidya&#x301;</i>. In the phase of <i>sain&#x32D;cara</i> this stronger positive <i>Avidya&#x301;</i> force causes the [Cosmic] ectoplasm to move away from <i>Purus&#x301;ottama</i> [Nucleus Consciousness]. In the phase of <i>pratisain&#x32D;cara</i>, if the negative <i>Vidya&#x301;</i> force is fixed at sixty and the positive <i>Avidya&#x301;</i> force at forty, the resultant will be twenty in favour of <i>Vidya&#x301;</i>, causing the [unit] ectoplasm to gradually advance towards Nucleus Consciousness, that is, towards non-matter.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.6.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#6.fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> The subtle Cosmic mind-stuff is metamorphosed into the material particles of the relative world. The return of these particles to non-matter is caused by physical clash, psychic clash and the attraction of the Great. <!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->To encourage physical clash is a kind of sadhana which is called <i>karma yoga.</i> In <i>karma yoga</i> people perform sadhana physically by rendering service to living beings and the world at large, by conducting scientific research, etc. Physical clash increases the inter-atomic space within material objects, resulting in the transformation of crude matter into mind-stuff. This transformation of matter into mind occurs due to the aforementioned net twenty-point negative <i>Vidya&#x301;</i> force, so whatever energy of human beings and their physical science might be applied in the transforming process, those human beings and their physical science cannot add to the effect of that twenty-point force. <!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Those people who opt for the path of physical clash use all the energy they have gained in the process of <i>pratisain&#x32D;cara</i> to deal with matter. Thus although there is no scope for their minds to acquire knowledge, they certainly have room for devotion, because the goal of the <i>Vidya&#x301;</i> force with which they are engaged in physical clash is Nucleus Consciousness. So those who move in the flow of <i>Vidya&#x301;</i> are certainly advancing towards <i>Brahma</i> [the Supreme Entity]. This movement towards <i>Brahma</i>, this attraction towards Nucleus Consciousness, is termed &ldquo;devotion&rdquo;. <!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Self-awareness develops through clash. The awareness that develops through physical clash is termed <i>jada&#x301;buddhi</i> [crude physical intellect] because it is associated with <i>jada&#x301;</i> [matter]. The consciousness of animals and undeveloped human beings is matter-oriented. But even in developed human society, if someone is an atheist or a materialist, we can only term their intellect as <i>jada&#x301;buddhi</i>. Such people deny the existence of spirituality in order to hide their intellectual deficiencies. Their denial betrays their moral and intellectual bankruptcy. It does not speak of their glory, nor does it diminish the value of spirituality. <!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Devotion plays a positive role in the process of clash. Had there been no factor to maintain the balance among all the objects created within the Macrocosmic Mind, the entire structure of the universe would have fallen apart. For the sake of harmony and balance within the universe, there is a mutual attraction among all the objects; each microcosm attracts the other microcosms. All finite microcosms &ndash; the innumerable manifestations of the Supreme Entity &ndash; are entitled to that universal love with which It has bound each microcosm to Itself, entitled to the wave of that universal love, in which Its divine ocean of bliss is perennially flowing. Attraction is the innate characteristic of microcosms. When this attraction is for finite objects, it is called <i>ka&#x301;ma</i> [&ldquo;physical longing&rdquo;], and when it surges towards the Cosmic Entity, it is called <i>prema</i> [&ldquo;divine love&rdquo;]. Of course, <i>ka&#x301;ma</i> is nothing but a limited form of <i>prema</i>. When microcosms rush towards <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a</i> [Supreme Consciousness] attracted by the irresistible force of divine love, it is termed &ldquo;devotion&rdquo;. Since clash drives the microcosms towards subtlety, it follows that clash must be the sustainer of devotion. <!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Materialists are worshippers of <i>ka&#x301;ma</i>. They are preoccupied with casteism, nationalism, communism, etc. They confine their love to a particular social group or state and do not feel any qualms of conscience about spitting venom at another social group or state. Such a limited expression of love cannot be called devotion. Genuine devotees will shower their love equally on each and every entity of this universe. When materialists put on a show of universal love, it is merely a ploy which they use to misappropriate others&#146; property. <!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..18"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Psychic Clash<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->The second possibility is struggle on the intellectual plane &ndash; psychic clash. In this sort of clash, people strive only to satisfy their psychic longings unrelated to the physical body. They do not desire mundane objects of pleasure, but seek psychic objects such as name, fame, etc. Pure psychic clash is perhaps subtler than physical clash, but to what extent can it promote human welfare? Even educated and intelligent people constantly indulge in mudslinging against others merely to attain name and fame, even though they are not greedy for money. Can this sort of psychic clash lead the mind towards subtlety? On the one hand ectoplasms are powdered down due to clash and their minds may achieve a fair degree of expansion, but on the other hand, under the domination of the propensity of greed, their minds gradually move towards greater crudity; that is, they move along the path of negative <i>pratisain&#x32D;cara</i>. <!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..20"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Attraction of the Great<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->That is not to say that one should avoid physical and psychic clashes. On the contrary, one should encourage them, but without losing sight of the Macrocosmic goal. <!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->When one&rsquo;s mind becomes more subtle and expanded, it is no longer assailed by petty thoughts. The mind-atoms (atoms of ectoplasm) will be powdered down, and in the fire of sadhana those powdered-down atoms will become ensconced in non-duality. So physical and psychic clash achieve their highest fulfilment in the attraction of the Great. Without this divine attraction, life loses its charm. <!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->The mind is one&rsquo;s best friend if it moves towards subtlety, but if it degenerates and becomes crude it is one&rsquo;s worst enemy. Due to psychic clash people today have created atom bombs, but as their endeavour is motivated by materialistic desires, the consequences have been horrifying. <!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->The structure of the mind is determined by the nature of its object. If the psychic object is crude, the inter-atomic gaps within the mind decrease in size, and the mind will ultimately refuse to accept anything except its own crude object. For this reason the supporters of crude isms become incapable of accepting the rational ideas of others, and closing their eyes and plugging their ears, they try to cling to their own irrational rituals. Their psychic receptivity is lost due to the superimposition of crude ideation. They do not feel the need for the <i>Vidya&#x301;</i> force to exceed the <i>Avidya&#x301;</i> force. They say, &ldquo;Why should I bother about such subtle things. I am quite happy as I am.&rdquo; Such people, engrossed as they are with materialism, are bound to be reborn in crude material bodies. <!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->When the goal of one&rsquo;s ideation is <i>Parama&#x301;tman</i> [the totality of all unit consciousnesses], one progresses in an absolute sense. As one&rsquo;s psychic object is subtle and expansive, one&rsquo;s psychic body also becomes subtle and expansive and finally becomes one with the Macrocosm. It was assumed that during the period of psychic clash in the phase of <i>pratisain&#x32D;cara</i>, microcosms progress due to the resultant <i>Vidya&#x301;</i> force (a negative twenty in our example). But as a result of Cosmic ideation, can the speed of the microcosms&rsquo; progress exceed that <i>pratisain&#x32D;cara</i> speed? Yes, it can. This is known as the attraction of the Great. But some <i>sa&#x301;dhakas</i> whose brain and nervous system have become accustomed to the natural speed of <i>Vidya&#x301;</i> find it difficult to adjust to the accelerated movement created by the attraction of the Great. This difficulty is expressed through vibrational symptoms such as tears of joy, horripilation, dance, etc. <i>Sa&#x301;dhakas</i> who can adjust to the accelerated movement will not be affected by these expressions. <!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->The movement caused by the attraction of the Great is called true devotion; such devotion results from worshipping the Great. Physical clash also produces a type of devotion, but that is static in nature. And the devotion caused by psychic clash is mutative in nature. Actually, there is very little difference between the devotion born out of psychic clash and that born out of observance of the moral code [i.e., cardinal moral principles]. Such psychic-clash or moralistic devotees cannot feel the sweetness of sentient devotion, because their minds are not filled with the thought of the Supreme; their minds are filled with petty thoughts; their outlook is that of one engaged in a commercial transaction. Ideation on the Supreme is the only way to attain real spiritual peace. The attraction of the Great is the only genuine devotion. <!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph --><i>Parama&#x301;tman</i> has been attracting all to Himself,<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.6.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#6.fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> with no exception. Some people complain that <i>Parama&#x301;tman</i> has forgotten them, but to say that is unjust, for no living being is outside <i>Brahma Cakra</i>. He attracts all through His sweet bond of love. Sometimes this love appears to be painful, sometimes pleasurable. But whatever the experience, painful or pleasurable, He comes to you. He does not cast you away in a world beyond the scope of pain or pleasure. If you ever see that this has happened, you will know that you have lost your identity. <!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->Hence when a genuine spiritual aspirant experiences happiness he or she will say, &ldquo;O Lord, how great You are to have remembered such an insignificant person as me,&rdquo; and when he or she experiences pain, &ldquo;O Lord, how great You are to have come to me in the form of sorrow, even when others ignore me.&rdquo; An innocent person who is acquitted in a court case should say, &ldquo;O Lord how great You are! You have saved me by upholding justice.&rdquo; And the guilty one should say, &ldquo;O Lord, how great You are! You have made me realize my mistakes by putting me through physical and psychic torment.&rdquo; And the judge should say, &ldquo;O Lord, You have honoured me by making me the deliverer of justice.&rdquo; <!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->According to divine decree, if the negative <i>Vidya&#x301;</i> force in <i>pratisain&#x32D;cara</i> is sixty and the positive <i>Avidya&#x301;</i> force is forty, then the resultant <i>Vidya&#x301;</i> force is twenty. With the help of this resultant force of <i>Vidya&#x301;</i> (twenty), <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a</i> attracts microcosms towards Himself. If microcosms surrender totally to <i>Vidya&#x301;</i>, they will certainly attain <i>Brahma</i> some day. And if the microcosms can, by virtue of sadhana, accelerate the flow of <i>Vidya&#x301;</i>, then their resultant <i>Vidya&#x301;</i> force will merge in the resultant <i>Vidya&#x301;</i> force of <i>Brahma</i>. This pursuit of <i>Vidya&#x301;</i> in individual life is the sadhana of <i>Sagun&#x301;a Brahma</i> [the Qualified Supreme Entity]. But if one wrongly pursues the path of <i>Avidya&#x301;</i>, one moves counter to the resultant <i>Vidya&#x301;</i> force of <i>Brahma</i>. The result of this movement against the Cosmic will can never be good. Philosophically it is known as <i>pralaya</i> [annihilation]. Hence while doing the sadhana of <i>Sagun&#x301;a Brahma</i>, one has to increase the <i>Vidya&#x301;</i> force. <!-- /block --></p>

As long as human beings advance due to the resultant <i>Vidya&#x301;</i> force of the Supreme Entity, they are regarded as <i>sa&#x301;dhakas</i> of sentient devotion; that is, the wave of the resultant force during the <i>pratisain&#x32D;cara</i> phase is the wave of sentient devotion. In the flow of their movement they only have one desire in their minds, the desire for liberation. And when they cleanse themselves of all impurities and take the help of the full negative force in order to become one with Nucleus Consciousness, the devotion through which they advance is called <i>ra&#x301;ga&#x301;tmika&#x301; bhakti</i> [&ldquo;non-attributional devotion&rdquo;]. At that phase of sadhana they do not desire liberation, but yearn for <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a</i> alone. In this category of devotees the resultant <i>Vidya&#x301;</i> force of twenty is converted into the original sixty <i>Vidya&#x301;</i> force [of the Supreme Entity]. <!-- /block --></p>

Even illiterate people can perfect non-attributional devotion. When great scholars, well-versed in the scriptures, see the height of devotion of the common masses, they stare in blank amazement, like fools. When spiritual aspirants advance along the path of devotion, but do not develop the resultant <i>Vidya&#x301;</i> force sufficiently to attain the status of non-attributional devotion, they attain a stage of devotion called <i>ra&#x301;ga&#x301;nuga bhakti</i> [&ldquo;attributional devotion&rdquo;]. <!-- /block --></p>

<div class=book_chapter_info_top></div>

<a name="7..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The characteristic of a unit mind is that its goal is multi-purposive whereas its expression is unilateral, confined to a particular space, time and individuality. The goal of the Cosmic mind, however, is uni-purposive and Its expression multilateral, manifested in all time, space and individuality. This is the major difference between the microcosm and Macrocosm. A unit mind can only think of one object at a particular time, or remain attached to one entity at a particular time, but cannot exist in more than one place or at more than one time. But the Cosmic Mind expresses Himself in more than one action, at more than one place, and in more than one entity. A microcosm expresses itself unilaterally, but nurtures desires which are multilateral. It may want to be a king, and a billionaire, and a learned person, and so much more. But when it actually performs actions, it can only act in one direction, not many. But the Macrocosmic endeavours are multilateral. His only desire is to get all His reactive momenta exhausted through the suffering of the microcosms; to move towards fullness through the various times, spaces and individualities.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->In the case of microcosms, the creation of space and individuality occurs at a particular time. And that particular time becomes the past at a different time. But the Macrocosm transcends time, for the three realms of time &ndash; past, present and future &ndash; lie embedded in His mind. It may be that a thousand years ago, a certain unit mind was sheltered in a particular physical structure at a certain place, and today has found shelter in a different structure at an entirely different place, and a thousand years from now may find shelter in another structure at another place. These three states of existence &ndash; that which was, that which is and that which will remain &ndash; lie in their totality in the Macrocosm, the Witness of all, as the continuation of the same flow. For the Macrocosm there is no external space, hence, there are no spatial differences: Mithila, The Punjab, Russia, and America all are equal to Him. Each and every entity is an object of His mental imagination, thus for Him there are no external individual differences. The rich and the poor, the literate and the illiterate, are all His psychic projections, sheltered in His vast Macrocosmic Mind. Therefore under no circumstance can there be any allegation of partiality against Him.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->According to some people space is infinite, but in reality that is not the case. Space is a limited expression bound by the static principle of Prakrti. That which is bound by the static principle cannot be called infinite. We may say that space is vast, but not infinite. For the Macrocosm there is no difference between a partial expression of space, and the totality of space; between individuality and collectivity. Microcosms concern themselves with time, space and person; but the Macrocosm will think of them as his own psychic projection. What will happen if the Macrocosm does not think of anything as his psychic projection? The result will be that whatever the Macrocosm views from the microcosmic viewpoint will appear to be real. That particular object will be a mere fraction of His vast psychic flow.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Though the Macrocosmic purpose is singular, Its actional expressions are multilateral. In this actional flow there is limitless dynamism. That is why the Macrocosm has equal concern for all objects at all times. All created entities are equally assimilated in Him. The unit mind, however, tries to assimilate an object with which it is associated at a particular time, and in a particular place and person, treating it as its own to the exclusion of all other entities. This is why people say, &ldquo;  my house, _my_ country, _my_ language&rdquo;. Behind such expressions the psycho-philosophy of microcosmic exclusiveness is quite apparent. it is the same spirit of exclusiveness which causes unnecessary conflicts over state, country, language, community, creed, and so on. These narrow sentiments occur in the absence of an integral, universal viewpoint. So although the goal of the unit mind is multilateral, its movement at a particular time is unilateral, and thus it cannot be concerned with more than one object at a time. However, in the process of constant Cosmic ideation the multilateral goal of the unit mind becomes unilateral, and its unilateral actional expression becomes multilateral. It becomes an active participant in a multi-dimensional actional flow with a uni-purposive goal.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="7..7"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->This Cosmic entity has innumerable heads. The microcosm is one-headed but the Macrocosm is many-headed. That is, His actional expression is multi-dimensional, for His movement is towards all objects at a time. The Macrocosm also has innumerable eyes. The microcosm can only see a particular object at a particular time in a particular place, but the Macrocosm can watch His own self as well as every single movement of every microcosm. He is the Witness of all. The witness-ship of your existence, of all your actions, lies in Him. And when He witnesses you, He is witnessing an internal object. The microcosm cannot focus its vision on more than one object at a time; nor can it witness anything except its own self. All other entities are external to the microcosm. To enter another mind, or to enter within any other object, is beyond its capacity. The Macrocosm, however, is the Witness of Its own self and all other objects. Hence you cannot think anything secretly. Any secret thought that arises in your mind immediately arises in His mind too, because your mind is located in a tiny corner of His vast mind. Nor can you do anything secretly because every action of yours is nothing but a minor change of place of physical objects within His mind. The microcosm can only witness one object at a time, but the Macrocosm can witness innumerable objects at a time, hence we say that he is multi-eyed.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->A microcosm can move in only one direction at a time: it cannot move towards the north and the south simultaneously. Thus we can say that the microcosm has only one pair of legs, whereas the Macrocosm has innumerable pairs of legs. He can move in all directions which you know &ndash; north, south, east, west &ndash; and even in those directions you do not know, simultaneously. He even moves where the citta has not yet been metamorphosed into the quinquelemental factors. So though His goal is uni-purposive, His movement is multilateral. Hence we can say that He has innumerable pairs of legs.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Now the question may arise: Is the totality of all the expressed microcosms of this manifested universe, the Macrocosm? No, this expressed universe is the manifested form of His mind-stuff. The Macrocosmic citta is sometimes expressed in the form of crude matter, and sometimes as unit minds created as a result of the process of clash and cohesion within the material structure. The Macrocosm is certainly the collection of all expressed matter and all unit minds, but that is not His totality. In him there also exists His unmanifested, infinite citta (mind stuff), His infinite doer-I (ahamtattva), and His infinite existential I-feeling (mahattattva).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Crude matter is the condensed form of Macrocosmic mind-stuff. When this Macrocosmic mind-stuff loses a certain degree of its condensed state, it assumes the form of microcosm. Thus houses, kitchen utensils, hills, valleys and oceans, are nothing but dormant states of mind. The moment they awaken from their slumber of inertness, the moment the consciousness latent within them gets expressed, they will be changed into unit minds. Can you imagine what a unique and wonderful thing this is?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->The state subtler than the ethereal factor is the subtle state of Macrocosm mind-stuff. The unexpressed citta of the Macrocosm, according to its inherent reactive momenta, gets transformed into the inanimate material world as well as innumerable microcosms. Within the unit mind as well as in the entire mass of inanimate matter there are constant physical and psychic clashes. The fundamental cause behind psychic clash lies in the Macrocosm. Hence the Macrocosm in His subtle way, is inseparably associated with His expressed physical manifestations, and remains as the untainted Witnessing Consciousness, as the Supreme Knower and Subjectivity of all subjectivities.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->The word dasha&#x301;ungulam used in the above shloka has got a special spiritual significance. According to the science of yoga, a&#x301;jin&#x32D;a&#x301; cakra (the pituitary plexus) is the controlling point of the mind. The abode of Attributional Brahma ends just a little above the pituitary plexus. The sahasra&#x301;ra cakra (pineal plexus) is located ten fingers above the pituitary plexus. This pineal plexus is the abode of Parama Shiva, the Supreme Consciousness. In the shloka the rs&#x301;i explains that the Macrocosm is inseparably associated with all the entities created by Saguna Brahma, remaining as the Witnessing Faculty at a point ten fingers above the pituitary plexus.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Is the intervening space between the microcosm and Consciousness completely void? No, the space between the mind and Consciousness is full of Macrocosmic mind-stuff.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..14"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Purus&#x301;a evedam&#x301; sarvam&#x301; yadbhu&#x301;tam&#x301; yacca bhavyam;<br>Uta&#x301;mrtatvasyesha&#x301;no yadannena&#x301;tirohati.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.7.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#7.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->As the Knowing Entity He is omniscient. The manifested &ldquo;all&rdquo; is nothing but His thought projection. What is the meaning of the word sarva (all)? The totality of whatever has been manifested and whatever has the capacity to be manifested, is called sarva. In the shloka it is mentioned that Purus&#x301;a, the underlying Consciousness, is both the cause and the effect of everything. The manifested world is eternally flowing within His mind and hence for Him the past, present and future are equally present. That which is still unmanifested is nothing but the reactive momenta of the Macrocosm, which contains the potential reactions of His original actions. The Macrocosm is fully aware of His original actions as well as His manifested state and manifestative potentialities.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->As the diverse forms of all the fundamental factors exist within the three realms of time, the Macrocosm knows them all. And that which still exists as the subtle Macrocosmic mind-stuff, that which as not yet taken the form of cruder mind-stuff, He Knows, for He is fully aware of the budding state of the dormant sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras. Microcosms having developed brains are partially aware of the particular space, time and individuality in which they find themselves. With the help of the nerve-cells and nerve-fibres of microcosms the reactive momenta are maintained and expressed.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.7.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#7.fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Herein lies the limitations, the imperfections of microcosms. After reading ten to twenty books people boast about their vast knowledge. They become so intoxicated with vanity and pride that they even scorn the world. But they forget that if the brain becomes even slightly defective, all their acquired knowledge can be thrown into oblivion. Motivated by the fear of failing their examinations, students labour hard to memorize their lessons. However, as soon as the examinations are over, their examination phobia disappears, and they forget all their acquired knowledge. The knowledge acquired through perception is only a temporary asset.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->The controlling capacity of microcosms is very limited. The microcosms can only temporarily control  objects whose physical waves are shorter than their own psychic waves. When the physical waves of objects are longer, they can at most be brought within sense-perception, but controlled. But when the wavelengths of physical objects are far longer than those of unit minds, they cannot even be brought within the scope of sense-perception. In this case those objects themselves exercise control over the physical existence as well as the ka&#x301;mamaya and annamaya kos&#x301;as of individuals. The psychic wavelength of an average person is greater than that of wine, and hence his or her mind is not easily influenced by wine. But due to excessive drinking the psychic wavelength of an alcoholic becomes shorter than the wavelength of wine, and he or she becomes its slave.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->The microscopic fraction of a wave radiated from an object and received by the sensory organs is called an inference (tanmatra). The capacity of receiving or perceiving tanma&#x301;tras is determined by the capacity of the indriyas as well as the psychic wavelength. Every atom and molecule in the process of conflict in the flows of Sain&#x32D;cara and Pratisain&#x32D;cara creates inferences. Of course, from the absolute point of view, every atom and molecule is Cosmic mind-stuff; but from the microcosmic point of view, the special type of inference radiated as a result of physical clash is called a tanma&#x301;tra. Usually we do not call the waves caused by psychic clash tanma&#x301;tras, because under normal circumstances such mental waves do not come within the perception of the sensory organs.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->When the psychic wave becomes lengthened as a result of spiritual ideation or the intellectual development caused by scientific pursuit, the human mind becomes more capable of controlling a greater amount of physical waves. As certain waves cannot be transmitted by the indriyas, human beings have manufactured scientific instruments for the purpose. These instruments help their psychic waves to utilize those physical waves which they previously considered to be uncontrollable according to their own sweet will. Moreover, through internal development, the psychic waves of human beings become capable of controlling the internal mean propensities. But whether it is a propensity or any other object, the degree of psychic control depends on the lengthening of the psychic waves.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->Microcosms, confined as they are within the relative factors, have very little controlling authority. The Macrocosm, however, is the controller of heaven and hell. It is worthwhile to mention here that the tendency of the human mind to degenerate towards matter in the path of negative pratisain&#x32D;cara is called hell (naraka), and the movement of the unit mind towards the Supreme Non-attributional Stance in the flow of positive Pratisain&#x32D;cara is called heaven. A unit mind which accepts gold or silver as the goal of life gradually becomes transformed into gold or silver. The psychic waves, as a result of constant ideation are first transformed into the waves of gold or silver and finally into crude gold or silver itself as a result of jad&#x301;asama&#x301;dhi. Later on it is reborn as a gold or silver, and spends its days confined within the safe of a money-minded merchant. This undesirable situation is called narakava&#x301;sa or life in hell.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->This type of degradation is not possible for creatures other than human beings, because they cannot perform original actions independently. With the development of intellect, and with the expansion of freedom in the field of action, human beings can either elevate themselves or degrade themselves. Prior to the attainment of this freedom they moved along the path of development in the flow of Pratisain&#x32D;cara. On acquiring this freedom, however, they have to make a tremendous effort to progress, or else they will certainly regress. Those people who move towards heaven or hell are not the controller of either. But the Macrocosm is the controller of both because the movement from hell to heaven is nothing but the direct result of the application of His divine energy.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Microcosms incessantly run after objects, one after the other, for their self-preservation. But as there is nothing outside the Macrocosm He does not run after any object.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..24"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->Sarvendriya gun&#x301;a&#x301;bhasam&#x301; sarvendriya vivarjitam.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->Microcosms can use their indriyas to receive tanmatras radiated from the fundamental factors or to activate the fundamental factors. For the microcosms these fundamental factors are external entities, but for the Macrocosm nothing is external. Moreover, as the Cosmic Mind is multilateral and Its knowledge infinite, It does not require indriyas or a brain. Even when the Macrocosm is an apparent state of inaction, He performs His role of Knower, Knowable and Knowledge with the help of Cosmic momentum. So it must be admitted that the indriyas&#146; capacity to receive objects actually lies in the Macrocosm. It is only when power is infused in microcosms that they develop the capacity of knowledge and action. Dead bodies have indriyas, but they do not possess the capacity of receiving objects because on death the power is withdrawn by Macrocosm.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->As the Macrocosm does not have any external object, He does not require the help of any indriya for the externalization of any action or the internalization of an idea. Thus He called Sarvendriyavivarjita (devoid of any indriya). The unit mind, in the process of constant Cosmic ideation, moves steadily towards the Macrocosm and finally becomes one with Him.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->One of the reasons for the multilateral goal of the microcosm lies in the nature of its ectoplasmic formations. According to the degree of density of the ectoplasm there is tremendous internal friction. Whenever the microcosm comes in contact with matter, it is drawn away from its original stance by the material waves. This scattering of the mind-stuff towards different objects is what we call the innumerable human cravings and longings. But in the limited practical realm, as its unit I-feeling has to work through the body, the unit mind finds it difficult to associate itself with more than one object at a time.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->When the extroversial tendency of human beings rushes towards objects in a particular environment, the mind begins to dance according to vibrations of the material waves of those objects. People who are not accustomed to using luxury goods in life hardly feel their necessity, but those who have already used such things have a natural weakness for them. In Bengali there is a proverb, Ya&#x301;r chele yata pa&#x301;y ta&#x301;r chele tata ca&#x301;y. &ldquo;The more a child gets the more it wants.&rdquo; In the practical field we notice that unless the material waves are controlled by the psychic waves no action can take place. In the absence of proper harmony between hands and mind a person cannot do anything. Thus for action to occur microcosms must control the physical waves of objects with the help of their entire psychic wave. Not only in the case of physical actions, but also while thinking it becomes impossible for microcosms to be focused on more than one object or action at a time.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->The excessive desire for material enjoyment, or the excessive pursuit of crude matter, reduces the inter-ectoplasmic space and as a result causes microcosms to become totally obsessed with their psychic objects. This is the reason why so-called learned people are averse to spiritual practice &ndash; their lives have become too egotistical.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->Spiritual practice (sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;) means to powder down the ectoplasmic structure with the help of opposing forces. That is, sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is a process of struggle against the inter-ectoplasmic affinity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->The individual parts of ectoplasmic cells are called citta&#x301;n&#x301;u. When these citta&#x301;n&#x301;u merge their individual identities into the cognitive faculty, or when they become separated from one another, it should be understood that one is progressing along the path of expansion. As the ectoplasms begin to drift away from one another their collective vibration feels more and more affinity towards the collective Cosmic waves and finally they merge themselves in those Macrocosmic waves. This process of merging one&#146;s individual flow in the Cosmic flow is called self-surrender. Those who have difficulty surrendering themselves suffer from structural crudity, a lack of Cosmic affinity, and an excess of vanity or ego.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->This universe is embedded in the Macrocosmic flow. There is no instrument within microcosms to fathom the depth of the Macrocosmic flow. Each and every atom and molecule of the universe, all minds and all matter, are drifting in the vast Macrocosmic flow. The person whose mind is free from the burden of crudity can easily float on the vast cosmic ocean, but who is loaded down with a heavy burden will sink.

But the moment the disembodied causal mind acquires a physical base knowledge is transmitted through the cruder portions of the nerve cells of microcosms.</p>
