<a name="2..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->In his two-part Human Society series, Shrii Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar has chosen to depart from chronological order: analysing modern society in the first part of the series, and then delving into human history, and human macrohistory, in the second part.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->In Human Society Part 2 the author sets out his famous theory of the social cycle. In each age of human history, people of a certain mental outlook dominate. Despite the positive contributions they may initially bring, this ruling class will increasingly exploit the other members of society and even the weaker members of their own class. The stresses they create within those whom they exploit cause some of the exploited to develop their minds in characteristic ways, enabling them to bring about revolution and dominate the next age of history.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Historians, sociologists and economists have become increasingly aware of the vast explanatory powers of this theory. It succeeds in bringing clarity and order out of the seeming chaos of humanity&#146;s long sojourn on this planet. Further elaboration of this theory can be found in various other works by the author: Idea and Ideology, A&#x301;nanda Su&#x301;tram, and the Prout in a Nutshell series.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="3..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The existence of the relative factors of time, space and person is substantiated in the field of cognition, and the cognizant bearing in its inertness is the highest stance of these factors. The inherent dynamicity of an entity, depending on the existential collaboration of another entity (or in certain cases of other entities, in which case immobility becomes of indefinite character), is called its gati [movement], while that of an entity independent of other entities is called its agati [immobility]. When this relative movement loses its adjustment with the temporal factor it may be called a state of pause &ndash; in a limited sense, staticity. The movement of an entity in relation to the witnessing faculty may be called its accelerated or retarded movement, depending upon the degree of its actional expression.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The question of whether or not movement and inertness are absolute is a knotty problem for both science and philosophy. In fact, just as dynamicity is characterized by the stigma of relativity, by the same logic inertness is also characterized by the stigma of relativity. So from an absolute point of view, if the existence of movement is denied, the existence of inertness or existential faculty will also have to be denied. When the observable objects do not seem to change place judged by relative standards, we call that state a state of inertness. But in such circumstances the movement of the observer and the observed entity within the Macrocosmic arena remains beyond the comprehension of our crude and subtle minds. That is why this so-called state of inertness cannot be called absolute inertness.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->In individual life the supreme stance is that state in which the causal mind, or astral mind, remains inactive. We cannot call the disembodied state of mind the supreme stance because in that case the seed of dynamicity is still active in the Cosmic Mind and the Cosmic corpor with the help of the Cosmic Operative Principle. From this we can deduce that the supreme stance can be attained only when the seed of psychic functioning has been demolished.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The Cosmic Operative Principle, whereby the Citishakti [Supreme Cognitive Faculty] goes on transforming itself into Cosmic ectoplasms and those Cosmic ectoplasms into the bha cakra [spatio-eternal system] without undermining its own status, must necessarily imbibe the witness-ship of the Sambharaka [Supreme Substantial Progenitor] of the ectoplasms. In this very witness-ship the ectoplasm-begotten primeval elements get their existential recognition or cognizance but their own motivity does not. The Supreme Substantial Progenitor witnesses the motivities of the ectoplasms in some of its stances like ota (uniscient), anujin&#x32D;a&#x301;ta (post-uniscient) and anujin&#x32D;a&#x301; (post-uniscience).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->When movement has the scope of being witnessed, there cannot be an acceleration or retardation in movement due to the self-involvement of unit ectoplasms. Though unit ectoplasms feel their internal movement, their external movement, which is dependent upon other entities, is not felt due to the absence of any second entity other than the unit ectoplasms themselves, and thus, instead of calling their sense of movement movement, it is more appropriate to call it non-movement, or motionlessness.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Unit consciousness, when it is self-dependent (it is dependent on others also), views the transposition of objects, and only that part of movement actually comes under the category of motion. When the self-dependent movement (as also the dependent one), giving up its effort or failing in its effort to exert, surrenders to the state of motionlessness, such a condition indeed is called cessation. Apparently all kinds of movement in this expressed universe are linked with the state of pause. Thus, every action is systaltic. The sam&#x301;koca&#x301;tmaka bha&#x301;va<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.3.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#3.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> is an attempt to find stability in a state of pause.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Pause is only a temporary state of inertness. Full expression of action occurs only after attaining momentum for movement from the state of inertness. No action is possible without momentum attained from the state of inertness, and thus every action (roughly, it is also called movement) must be systaltic, or pulsative, by nature.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->In the same way, unhindered expansion, or enhancement, and unhindered contraction are impossible in the realm of mundanity. The manifestative bearing of action or movement is directly related to the relative factors of time, space and person, and the contractive bearing is an attempt at detachment from the temporal factor. As the state of contraction is entrenched in inertness, the unit entity loses its awareness of the temporal factor.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Is that state which we call the state of expression a continuous process? In fact, the cause of expression is the momentum derived from the state of pause. With the momentum thus attained, the state of manifestation continues with ever-increasing speed until it reaches a final stage which is also a state of pause. This pause is also entrenched in a state of inertness, but in this state, due to the expressive impact of the temporal factor, no momentum can be acquired from the state of inertness. In the next state of pause, that is, in the second half of movement, the manifestative movement is transformed into non-manifestative inertness. This state of non-manifestative inertness is ever-decreasing by nature. This process of gradual contraction is nothing but an ultimate surrender to the state of inertness.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->A structure or an entity, after getting momentum from systolic pause, progresses towards manifestative pause. This is the rule. This momentum is attained in the absence of the assertive presence of the temporal factor. Such momentum cannot be attained when the personal factor is defective or not manifest. This sort of absence of the personal factor or structural defect is termed death.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->We can roughly compare this systaltic movement with a trek across a series of hills which are arranged in successive order. Having gathered vital force from the plain, one advances towards the first summit, that is, towards the state of manifestative pause. The trek down the other side of the hill can be compared with the movement towards systolic pause. And then again, acquiring one&#146;s strength, the uphill advance towards the next summit is a renewed attempt to reach manifestative pause. But while climbing up the hill one&#146;s physical speed decreases in relation to the proximity to the summit, although due to one&#146;s increased mental speed, one&#146;s aggregate speed actually increases. If one falls down the other side of the hill and corporeal derangement takes place, one will not be able to climb up the next slope after reaching the plain. This situation is called structural derangement, or death.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->The human respiratory system also provides us with a good comparison with the systaltic flow of movement. Puraka [inhalation] can be compared with the movement towards manifestative pause. The retention of breath at the end of puraka (pu&#x301;rn&#x301;a kumbhaka) is manifestative pause. Recaka [exhalation] is the movement towards systolic pause. And holding the breath after complete exhalation (shu&#x301;nya kumbhaka) is systolic pause. In the retention of breath after inhalation there is manifestation of time and continuity of movement, but no sense of dynamism. In the total exhalation, however, there is no manifestation of time but there is continuity of movement minus the sense of dynamism. [From the end of] one puraka to the beginning of another puraka constitutes half of the cycle of respiration. After every such half-cycle or trip, that is, in every post-exhalation pause, there occurs the death of the unit being. But after gathering vitality for the second time from this death or state of pause, the unit being comes alive again during the next inhalation. If, after the full cycle of inhalation and exhalation, the physical mechanism is unable to gather vital force from the state of pause, further inhalation becomes impossible and what we commonly call death occurs.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Actually, the unit structure dies thousands of times every day, after every exhalation. In the scriptures this sort of microcosmic death is called the khan&#x301;d&#x301;a pralaya [partial annihilation] of the unit entity. When the temporal factor is evident and the seed of or potential for further inhalation and exhalation is intact, this cannot be considered death. Yogic texts prescribe various methods of recaka&#x301;nta pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;ya&#x301;ma and puraka&#x301;nta pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;ya&#x301;ma [respiratory control] whereby a huge quantity of vital force may be acquired from the five fundamental factors.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->When the waves of the unit mind lose parallelism with those of the Macrocosmic Mind or move in the opposite direction, it can be called the degeneration of the unit entity. When the waves of the unit mind move in parallelism, it is called the natural movement of the unit mind. When the waves travel faster, we call it the advancement or progress of the unit mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Nothing in this relative world of multiplicities is stationary. Had this not been so, all entities would have become one &ndash; all the multiplicities, losing their distinctive individual faculties, would have been reduced to one singularity. Thus, the existence of the manifest world finds its substantiation not in the absolute flow, but in the relative flow, of movement.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->It is with the assembling of many individuals that a society comes into being. In a society it is impossible for individuals to move exclusively according to their individual sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras [inherent momenta]. Although it may be possible in the subtle and causal spheres, it is not possible in the physical sphere. The totality of various individual flows of movement constitutes collective social movement. Each individual flow is influenced by the collective flow and strives to move ahead in adjustment with it, at least in the mundane sphere.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->The fact is that an inorganic entity is transformed into an organic being due to physical clash. Further development of that being is a result of both physical and psychic clashes. These clashes come directly from the systolic pause of social forces and indirectly from natural sources.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->If the resultant cumulative flow of innumerable individuals is termed the social or collective flow, then the latter&#146;s trough and crest is shorter than the trough and crest of the individual flows. And this shortness of the collective wavelength hastens either a kra&#x301;nti [evolution] or a viplava [revolution].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->Manifestative movement acquires momentum from its previous state of pause in sam&#x301;kocer bha&#x301;va [systolic bearing]. The mildness or severity of the movement depends on both the length of the period of pause and the inherent strength of the structure. A long period of inertness may be termed death only when an old structure is unable to assimilate the vital force of pause. In this case a newer structure becomes necessary for the manifestative movement [from] the state of pause. This new structure may be either a newer form of the old one or an altogether different form. Whenever there is a state of manifestation following a state of inertness, changes are bound to occur within the structure. But that structure can only be called new when the unit mind or the collective mind cannot perceive the distinct change between the old and new forms.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->During the previous state of pause, one structure meets with death due to suppression or destruction by another structure. Such deaths occur both in individuals and in society. When a unit or society devours or suppresses another the necessary assimilation of conflicting waves and the resultant clashes cause its wavelength to become shorter in length, leading to the possibility of structural death. In this process of assimilation, if there is the possibility of vibrational adjustment, the individual and collective structures have a greater chance of acquiring more inherent vitality.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..21"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->Egyptian Civilization<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Take the case of ancient Egyptian civilization. Whether we like all the features of ancient Egyptian civilization or not, it could definitely claim some special characteristics. But the conflict of waves that occurred in its inner body weakened the collective waves of the society as a whole. The various social groups from Asia and the southeast European countries were inherently stronger in their collective waves than the Egyptians themselves, and this led to the destruction of the Egyptian civilization. However, a proper assessment of this historical occurrence will reveal that the ancient Egyptian civilization was not completely destroyed. Although many of the above-mentioned social groups were less sam&#x301;vedanashiila<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.3.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#3.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> (but had greater physical vitality) than the ancient Egyptian civilization and were therefore able to destroy both the vital force of its civilization and its social structure, they themselves were influenced by the greater sensibility of the ancient Egyptian civilization.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->The greatest blow to Egyptian civilization came from the section of Arab society that was imbued with Islamic ideology. Due to the influence of these new Arab bha&#x301;vadha&#x301;ra&#x301; [thought-waves], the new Egypt became dissociated, in its thought-waves, from ancient Egypt. Thus modern Egypt has ideologically<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.3.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#3.fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  nothing in common with its ancient past.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->The Arab culture was not only full of vitality, it also had a distinct sensibility of its own. Although the vitality of the Egyptian traditions was destroyed at the time of the Arab invasion, Egypt&#146;s inherent sensibility was not. What remained of Egyptian sensibility was diametrically opposite to the new Arab thought-wave. The Arabs assimilated the antithetical Egyptian sensibility, and as a result the Arab thought-wave was considerably weakened. As a result it became impossible for the Arabs to conquer Europe. This was also one of the main reasons for the retreat of the Iberian Moors.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->One question remains. Since ancient Arab thought-waves and Islamized Arab thought-waves were different from each other, why did the former not destroy the vital force of the latter? Actually, many ancient Arab thought-waves were assimilated into the Islamized Arab thought-waves. Where there were differences, there was tremendous conflict. However, a common a&#x301;darsha [ideology] and a common spiritual awareness, both accepted by a large number of people, greatly helped the Islamized Arab ideas to establish themselves over the ancient Arab ideas.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->Islamized Arab ideas suffered the same set-back in Persia on the east as they did in Egypt on the west. Persian society had its own distinct characteristics and only accepted Islamic thought-waves externally, while its own Persian ideology remained for a long time as a subterranean flow. It remains even today, though only as a thin current.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->Islamized Arab ideology became weakened as it passed through Persia, and after crossing the Indus Valley and entering India it was unable to exert a deep influence on Indian society. But this was secondary as a reason that the Islamized Arabs were unable to defeat India. The most important reason was the strength of India&#146;s social and spiritual ideology and the rationalistic mentality of the Indians themselves. Although the varn&#x301;a&#x301;shrama [caste] system was based on idol worship and created deep divisions in the Indian social structure, the greatness of India&#146;s moral, social and spiritual ideology had generated a powerful wave in her collective life. The Islamic social ideology, modified as it was after passing through Persia, was unable to obliterate that wave.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->That modified Islamic social ideology has lived side by side with the Indian social ideology for centuries, but due to the opposite natures of their waves, the exchange between them has been negligible. Of course Islamic society has had some influence on the external forms of Indian society, but Islam has not had any influence on the mental and spiritual outlook of the Indian people. The Sufi influence on Indian society (an influence particularly on Indian Vaishnavism) is actually of Persian and not of Islamic origin. The vibrational expression of the Sufi influence is in harmony with Indian thinking and it has therefore supplied vital energy to Indian social life for centuries.<!-- /block --></p>

In those days people&#146;s minds were so full of material thoughts, due to living in a hostile natural environment, that at that early stage everyone necessarily possessed a shu&#x301;dra mentality.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->Due to mutual self-interest people developed social bonds, but they were unable to build a social structure, and society in those days basically meant only a particular individual&#146;s own body, and the wife, to some extent sons and daughters, and close relatives that contributed to the pleasure of that body. As conjugal relations were based on gratification &ndash; on the enjoyer and the object of enjoyment &ndash; there was no sense of responsibility or humanity. Today there are shu&#x301;dras with this propensity scattered throughout the world in all societies.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->People with a shu&#x301;dra mentality fall in the same category as all animals that have a strong desire for physical enjoyment. At that time the powerful men, who had a strong desire for physical enjoyment, were polygamous. When such men were defeated, they were either exiled, or killed by stronger men. The little art and literature that existed did not reflect developed sensibilities. It was merely the expression of the greediness of people given to materialistic enjoyment.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="3..35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->People had no sense of duty towards each other and no social order had evolved.

<a name="3..36"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph -->Frankly stated, shu&#x301;dras live only for physical enjoyment. They neither bother about ideology nor give any value to rationality. Of the three aspects of time &ndash; past, present and future &ndash; they think only about the present. They have neither the time nor the inclination to think about the past or the future. Religion, spirituality and a genuine social system have no significance for them. Whatever religion, spirituality or social order we observe in shu&#x301;dra society results from an unholy alliance between their fearfulness and their self-interest.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..37"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=37 type=paragraph -->Intellectually shu&#x301;dras are as dull as beasts. Whether it is a natural calamity, or the gloomy night, or the joyful dawn, or a burning desert, they have always viewed and continue to view it either with the eyes of fear or with the eyes of escapism. This type of fear psychology elevates different natural phenomena in their eyes to the status of gods. They learn to worship trees, mountains, forests, seas, etc., as gods out of fear and a greater or lesser degree of self-interest, but not due to the inspiration of the indivisible Supreme Entity. We can thus conclude that the shu&#x301;dra social order is based on fear alone.<!-- /block --></p>

To win the minds of the ignorant shu&#x301;dras they have cheated, the ks&#x301;atriyas praise them lavishly for their victories. This praise of their hollow victories makes the shu&#x301;dras forget their defeat.

<a name="3..47"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=47 type=paragraph -->In the embryonic stage of the human race, those who became the slaves of nature due to circumstantial pressure were the shu&#x301;dras. But those among them who came in contact with the relatively harsh aspects of nature and made even a small amount of effort to survive by fighting against them, were, in the world of those days, the fathers of the ks&#x301;atriyas.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..48"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=48 type=paragraph -->Later on, those shu&#x301;dras who made a habit of fighting against nature due to the inspiration of the fathers of the ks&#x301;atriyas guided &ndash; and are still guiding and will continue to guide &ndash; the development of ks&#x301;atriya society. In fact, the seed of human greatness was dormant in the shu&#x301;dras and germinated in the ks&#x301;atriyas. Today the superiority that human beings enjoy over all other creatures in the society of living things results from their endeavours to conquer the animate and inanimate worlds; this was first expressed in the minds of the ks&#x301;atriyas.<!-- /block --></p>

The cowardly and intellectually-undeveloped shu&#x301;dras accepted the superiority of the ks&#x301;atriyas and paid obeisance to their bravery and spiritedness. The ks&#x301;atriyas used the shu&#x301;dras as servants in their fight against the inanimate world and ensured their obedience by courageously taking responsibility for their safety and protection. So the shu&#x301;dras also played a role in the ks&#x301;atriyas&#146; conquest of the inanimate world, and their role was not unimportant. But most of the credit goes to the ks&#x301;atriyas, because whatever the shu&#x301;dras did, they did under the wings of the ks&#x301;atriyas.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..50"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=50 type=paragraph -->The Start of the Ks&#x301;atriya Age<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..51"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=51 type=paragraph -->We may call the day the ks&#x301;atriyas started to protect the shu&#x301;dras the beginning of the Ks&#x301;atriya Age in human society, but that age did not come overnight. Numerous fragmented shu&#x301;dra societies gradually accepted the authority of the ks&#x301;atriyas and began to unite under their hegemony. In other words, many shu&#x301;dra societies would unite into a new social system, and in each case one ks&#x301;atriya would be the symbol of that new system. This acceptance of a ks&#x301;atriya as the symbol of shu&#x301;dra unity, which came about through a process of transformation, represents the first kra&#x301;nti [evolutionary step] in human history.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..52"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=52 type=paragraph -->Different groups formed, each with a ks&#x301;atriya as the symbolic head. To maintain the purity of the group&#146;s blood and in order to identify people correctly, brave and spirited women had at an earlier stage been recognized as the group-mothers. All the men and women in a group had been named after that matriarch. As both the mother and the father of a child belonged to the same group, the value of their having separate identities from each other was not felt. When a matriarch died and a new matriarch was elected, or when a group broke into sub-groups, it was only necessary to determine the identity of one&#146;s group-mother. In other words, ks&#x301;atriya society had initially been matriarchal. The group system of the Ks&#x301;atriya Age was the first stage in the evolution of a social system.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..53"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=53 type=paragraph -->During the Ks&#x301;atriya Age the different groups continually fought among themselves to establish their supremacy; hence in the ks&#x301;atriya social order, love for one&#146;s group was more evident than in the Shu&#x301;dra Age. The spiritedness and self-confidence of the ks&#x301;atriyas inspired people to unite and build a society out of a crude, self-centred consciousness; the consciousness and sentiment of prestige also played an important part. In other words, although the struggle for existence was the main concern, the struggle for prestige was not unimportant. This sentiment, this sense, of prestige greatly inspired people in the Ks&#x301;atriya Age in the work of conquering the inanimate world, and continues to inspire people even today.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..54"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=54 type=paragraph -->The shu&#x301;dras had fought solely to survive, whereas the ks&#x301;atriyas fought for their own survival, for the survival of others and for their prestige. The shu&#x301;dras&#146; main aim had been to arrange food and security by any means, whereas the ks&#x301;atriyas&#146; aim was to conquer with glory. This sentiment enabled the ks&#x301;atriyas to develop a subtler intellect and awakened their conscience and discriminative judgement. It went against the ks&#x301;atriyas&#146; conscience to kill the unarmed, to kill women, children or old people, to kill those who had surrendered, or to kill a retreating enemy. In a word, the ks&#x301;atriyas&#146; sense of valour transcended the animal level, and they learned to understand the value of human beings.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="3..56"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=56 type=paragraph -->It was to a large extent this sense of value that elevated conjugal and domestic life to the human level. Conjugal relations came not to be limited to the enjoyer-and-enjoyed level but to include a sense of duty. As conjugal relations developed, a father&#146;s sense of duty towards his children also awakened. This led to a reduction in the mothers&#146; responsibilities to some extent, and as a consequence women became partially dependent on men for their food and clothes, particularly during pregnancy and immediately after childbirth. As a result, although couples belonged to the same group, they began to form into families headed by men. Because families were headed by men, the groups also became male-dominated and the matriarchs lost the power they had previously enjoyed.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..57"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=57 type=paragraph -->In olden times ks&#x301;atriya societies began to recognize a man and a woman as husband and wife, although the bonds of such relationships were not strong. As the society became patriarchal, even in the latter half of the Ks&#x301;atriya Age men kept many wives as they had in the Shu&#x301;dra Age. The only difference between the polygamies of the two eras was that wives in the Shu&#x301;dra Age had no social ties to their husbands, whereas the ties between the husbands and wives in the latter half of the Ks&#x301;atriya Age were socially recognized. Although the social system which was formed in the first half of the Ks&#x301;atriya Age was to some extent strengthened in the latter half, the stability of both conjugal and group relations in the latter half depended more on the physical abilities and bravery of the group-father, or patriarch, and other males than on genuine humanism or a sense of discipline. The maxim of the Ks&#x301;atriya Age was &ldquo;Might makes right.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..58"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=58 type=paragraph -->Human beings are creatures of sensibility. A sense of responsibility, as well as love and affection, having already awakened in parents for their children, in the latter half of the Ks&#x301;atriya Age a sense of responsibility also started to awaken in children towards their parents. Duty-conscious children were careful to maintain the traditions and proclaim the heroism of their fathers, and fathers also wanted their children to inherit their heroic qualities, powerful personalities, and traditions. Thus, as the relationship between fathers and their children was strengthened, society was also strengthened.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..59"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=59 type=paragraph -->In order to properly maintain the heroism and traditions of the family, great importance was given to the careful selection of brides and grooms at the time of marriage.

<a name="3..61"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=61 type=paragraph -->There is no doubt that the culture of the ks&#x301;atriyas &ndash; their music, dance and art &ndash; reflected their sensibilities. The art of the ks&#x301;atriyas depicted their tremendous efforts to conquer the world and not their enjoyment of material pleasure. These warlike people gave great importance to increasing their numbers so that they could fight against their enemies. That is why the courageous but uncultured ks&#x301;atriyas of ancient times invented linga, or phallus, worship as a symbol for the increase of their numerical strength. This mentality of the ks&#x301;atriyas can be found in the Mayan civilization of America and the Dravidian civilization of India as well as in particular types of Tantric ritual. No matter how phallus-and-vulva worship be philosophically explained today, it essentially expresses the ancient ks&#x301;atriya desire to increase their population.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..62"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=62 type=paragraph -->The patriarch, or gan&#x301;apati (gan&#x301;esha), of a ks&#x301;atriya society was worshipped in those days as a god, and in this worship the head of an elephant, recognized as the greatest animal, would be used as the head of the idol. And in fact this gan&#x301;apati or gan&#x301;esha [group leader] figure, after undergoing certain philosophical explanations in those ancient times, evolved into the god Gan&#x301;esha. Even though society is now vaeshya-dominated, both linga and Gan&#x301;apati are still commonly worshipped. Many people do not understand or deliberately try to forget that what underlies this form of worship is the primitive social outlook of the ks&#x301;atriyas.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..63"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=63 type=paragraph -->Today some philosophers may say, Yasmin sarva&#x301;n&#x301;i liiyante talliun&#x32D;gam, or Liun&#x32D;gate gamyate yasma&#x301;d talliun&#x32D;gam &ndash; that is, &ldquo;The entity in which everything merges is called liun&#x32D;ga,&rdquo; [or &ldquo;The entity from which everything originates [[and towards which everything is moving]] is called liun&#x32D;ga&rdquo;]. In other words, &ldquo;worship of the linga means worship of Supreme Consciousness.&rdquo; This interpretation is unacceptable, and the best proof that this is so is that Supreme Consciousness cannot be contained in any receptacle, whereas the physical linga does serve well as a symbol of numerical growth.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..64"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=64 type=paragraph -->Gan&#x301;apati was also gradually transformed into a scriptural deity. The authors of the Puranas traced the ancestry of Gan&#x301;apati and claimed that he was the son of the god Shiva, in whose name the philosophically-interpreted phallus worship was practised. An attempt was also made in scripture to synthesize these two ideas with each other. Thus the sensibilities of the ancient ks&#x301;atriyas were dyed the colour of the intellect of the vipras and accepted in a new way.<!-- /block --></p>

They live and die unnoticed, and unnoticed they carry about the burdens of their lives. Their birth, life and death mean nothing to the collective being of humanity. They cannot create any vibration in the human race through their actions, nor can they arouse sleeping humanity with a thunderous voice.

<a name="3..79"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=79 type=paragraph -->To maintain society an administration is necessary, and to maintain the administration a system of government is necessary. No one would submit to the administration of a shu&#x301;dra. The ks&#x301;atriyas introduced the first administrative system through brute force. The shu&#x301;dras and the weak ks&#x301;atriyas submitted to the brute force of the stronger ks&#x301;atriyas and accepted the latters&#146; patriarch as king. Under the administration of this king, a social and governmental structure began to form.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..80"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=80 type=paragraph -->The ks&#x301;atriya social system emphasized a sense of discipline. The ks&#x301;atriya administration had little concern for what the common people thought about that discipline or whether they were practically benefited by it.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..81"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=81 type=paragraph -->The selection of the ks&#x301;atriya leader was based on physical might, strength of arms and mental strength. Naturally after the death of a leader, either one of his sons, or that man from one of the groups under his protection who had the greatest number of similar qualities, was accepted as the next ks&#x301;atriya leader.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..82"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=82 type=paragraph -->In the course of time the age of the ks&#x301;a&#x301;tra-pita&#x301; or sardda&#x301;r [ks&#x301;atriya leader] was replaced by the age of the monarchy. This transformation took place mainly for the sake of maintaining discipline. After the death of a ks&#x301;atriya leader, there would be a violent struggle for power among his sons and among the youths of the groups under his protection. By the time this struggle was finally over and a new ks&#x301;atriya leader was selected, everything in the group was topsy-turvy, or the group had become fragmented into many smaller groups. A greater sense of discipline was obviously needed to save the group from such disorder or fragmentation. So to avoid internal conflicts, the custom of appointing the son, particularly the eldest son, of the ks&#x301;atriya leader as the leader&#146;s successor, was introduced in most of the ks&#x301;atriya groups. Once this became the system, it may be said that monarchy had become established in ks&#x301;atriya society.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..83"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=83 type=paragraph -->The kings of those days were generally not kings in the sense that we use the word today. Because a kingdom was acquired through heredity, that is, because the system of selecting the ks&#x301;atriya king or leader was not based on physical might, strength of arms and mental strength, a king had to some extent to cater to public opinion. How much he had to cater depended upon the degree of unity, the level of discrimination and the standard of intelligence of the local people. For example, in most parts of India, when the king made out a deed on ta&#x301;mralipi [copper sheets used like writing paper], he would write the following command to his subjects: &ldquo;You shall accept this deed of gift.&rdquo; But in Bengal, in such deeds, the king would write the following request: &ldquo;Please approve of this deed of gift.&rdquo; This example shows that the kings of Bengal tried to take into account the will of their subjects; they did not act as dictators. Once the system of monarchy was established among the ks&#x301;atriyas, the work of building society advanced under its sheltering wing.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..84"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=84 type=paragraph -->A strong social structure could not be formed where a monarchy had evolved relatively late or where a democracy or republic had been established after a short period of monarchy. Due to a lack of strong state control in those countries where repeated coup d&#x301; tats took place or where the reigns of the kings were very short, a firm social system could not be built, nor could a proper sense of discipline be awakened in the people. Of course by &ldquo;the reigns of the kings&rdquo; here I mean the administrations of the ks&#x301;atriya leaders. Their long-term dictatorial administrations amounted for this purpose to the same things as long-lasting monarchies.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..85"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=85 type=paragraph -->(The sense of discipline in ks&#x301;atriyas is the same as that in soldiers. It means that whether one likes it or not, one has to abide by certain rules and regulations lest the defences be breached.)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..86"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=86 type=paragraph -->After the French revolution no French government had the opportunity to govern for a long time. So although the common people in post-revolutionary France came to suffer less exploitation by the king, and less abuse of government power, the big harm done was the lack of a firm, well-knit social structure.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..87"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=87 type=paragraph -->In the United States of America, the world-famous democracy, a social system and social discipline are largely lacking, although there is no dearth of social education, nor the least lack of a spirit of social service or a sense of unity among the general public. If those who are devoid of spirituality are not controlled by the authority of the government or some other group, it will not be possible for them to properly follow discipline.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..88"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=88 type=paragraph -->In some countries in ancient times, a social system meant the caste system. But even the caste, or varn&#x301;a&#x301;shrama, system could not be built in a firm way in those parts of those countries where the state or governmental system was weak. As of the onset of Islamic rule, a strong varn&#x301;a&#x301;shrama system had never been created in East Bengal [now Bangladesh] or in some other parts of eastern India, due to the weakness of the state administration.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="3..90"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=90 type=paragraph -->In ks&#x301;atriya society people do not follow religion or develop a sense of discipline out of what we would call a fear complex, exactly, but a strong desire for self-preservation certainly plays a part. Although unholy alliances based on self-interest exist among groups of ks&#x301;atriyas, such alliances do not exhibit the base mentality of the shu&#x301;dras.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..91"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=91 type=paragraph -->Were the ks&#x301;atriyas intellectually superior or inferior to animals? An animal knows how to meet its physical needs; it enjoys crude pleasures and has a sense of responsibility towards its children and to some extent towards its mate. But if we analyse the way in which ks&#x301;atriyas are prepared to protect others, sacrifice for an ideology, or give up their most precious possession, their lives, for the sake of honour or for some other reason, it becomes clear that they are far more developed mentally than animals. In fact, it is the life of shu&#x301;dra society that is only a little more developed than that of animals. Ks&#x301;atriyas&#146; lives are more developed, their minds more fully expressed.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..92"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=92 type=paragraph -->Factors in the Evolution of the Ks&#x301;atriyas<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..93"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=93 type=paragraph -->A close scrutiny will lead us to the conclusion that the physical clash of animal life resulted in the creation of shu&#x301;dra life, and the physical clash of the shu&#x301;dras, together with the struggles of their underdeveloped minds (mental clash), created the minds of the ks&#x301;atriyas.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..94"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=94 type=paragraph -->The warlike ks&#x301;atriyas regarded nature as the collective embodiment of different forces. To their limited understanding this idea of a synthesis of forces did not appear to be impossible, but to think more deeply than this was beyond their capacity. An outlook of enjoyment caused their minds, through physical clash, to move sometimes towards crudity in a process of analysis, and sometimes towards subtlety in a process of synthesis. The Brahmava&#x301;da [spiritual philosophy based on Brahma] of the Upanishads was the remarkable historical culmination of this synthetic process. The idea that the polytheism of shu&#x301;dra society might rest upon monotheism first originated as a vague idea in the minds of the ks&#x301;atriyas, and that is why it is said that the propounders of Brahmava&#x301;da were ks&#x301;atriyas.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..95"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=95 type=paragraph -->(King Janaka of India was said to be the preceptor of Brahmava&#x301;da, thus establishing the ks&#x301;atriya origin of Brahmava&#x301;da. But as every student of history knows, no king by the name Janaka ever lived in India. &ldquo;Janaka&rdquo; was simply a common title used by many kings. Those admired by the common people for their erudition &ndash; such looked-up-to individuals &ndash; were also known by this name. Nevertheless, the ks&#x301;atriya authorship of the Vedas was not an ordinary or insignificant achievement. I have already said that this authorship was the culmination of a remarkable historical process, the like of which is extremely rare. And it took place among the ks&#x301;atriyas.)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..96"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=96 type=paragraph -->A subtle analysis therefore reveals that the ks&#x301;atriya spirituality stemmed from their desire to attain more and more and to express themselves to the maximum extent.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..97"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=97 type=paragraph -->Where ideas are of secondary importance, the factor of gain or greed comes to be primary. The ks&#x301;atriyas&#146; hope of probable eventual gain, born out of their greed, later helped the vipras to achieve absolute power. The ks&#x301;atriyas ultimately had to sell their physical brawn to the absolute authority of the vipras.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..98"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=98 type=paragraph -->In the ks&#x301;atriya social system the saying &ldquo;Live and let live&rdquo; is not as important as the saying &ldquo;Live with dignity&rdquo;. It is as if within the social structure the ks&#x301;atriya mind tries to express the sentiment: &ldquo;A person of honour, like the petals of a flower, will try to shine above all others or will fall in a storm. It is not the nature of petals to live beneath others.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..99"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=99 type=paragraph -->One who is afraid of various types of force cannot comprehend the truth that underlies this diversity, but one who struggles gradually learns to recognize the nature of diversity and has the opportunity to reach a state of dynamic equilibrium.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.3.fn8"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#3.fn8">8</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..100"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=100 type=paragraph -->We do not have to waste words to convince people that in the life of a fighting group discipline is extremely important. There cannot be any doubt that in ks&#x301;atriya society, whether it is a genuine society or not, there must be a well-knit system. Under this system the chariot of exploitation may run over the weak without slowing down, the hunger of millions of people may provide opportunities for one person to live in great luxury, and a relationship of exploiter and exploited may be established among people instead of fraternal relationships, but it is still a system. Regardless of its merits and demerits, it is the nature of ks&#x301;atriyas to try to perpetuate the system they are living under.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..101"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=101 type=paragraph -->But ks&#x301;atriya society has a sensibility which is not like that of merciless nature. What stands out most is hero worship. The weak submit to the leadership of the strong, and the strong protect the weak in exchange for their submission. That is why, in the ks&#x301;atriya social system, it is considered a virtue to save those who are distressed and seek protection; and this type of dutifulness is recognized as an important mental outlook in the life of society. For this reason alone and not for any other reason, parents will be looked after and protected when they become incapable of looking after themselves due to senility or physical infirmity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..102"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=102 type=paragraph -->In ks&#x301;atriya society people are divided as a matter of course into innumerable groups which fight incessantly among themselves, but an unquenchable thirst for victory makes life somewhat like a game of chess, and the call to do battle and to display a powerful personality also gives meaning to life. Thus it is not the tendency of ks&#x301;atriyas to carry the burden of all life&#146;s disappointments. Ks&#x301;atriyas enjoy the delights of collective living more than shu&#x301;dras, because the collective sentiment that inspires fighting people to stick together in weal and woe makes even pain, since it is collective, sweet.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..103"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=103 type=paragraph -->The Rise of the Vipras<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..104"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=104 type=paragraph -->Ks&#x301;atriyas are always awake, but it can hardly be said that their eyes are always wide open to the light. Those who are already awake may not need to be awakened, but if they do not know which way to look, then they need to be shown which way to look.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..105"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=105 type=paragraph -->Ks&#x301;atriyas want to dash forward with an all-conquering attitude, but without distinguishing between darkness and light. In darkness, failing to ascertain the strength of their opponents, they challenge them to fight, and as a result they often leave the world prematurely, mauled and mangled. The history of the ks&#x301;atriyas is painted with blood, but not illumined with intelligence. They display powerful personalities, spiritedness and courage, but no far-sightedness or wisdom, nor the support of subtle intellect. Therefore, after the Ks&#x301;atriya Age had lasted for some time, intellectuals began to control the ks&#x301;atriyas with their keen intellect.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..106"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=106 type=paragraph -->Those with intellect encouraged the ks&#x301;atriyas to look in directions where they had not looked before, and repeatedly explained to them things they had never understood. After this state of affairs had continued for some time, the ks&#x301;atriyas began to submit to the intellectuals and, recognizing their superiority, began to use their forceful personalities to carry out the intellectuals&#146; instructions. The intellectuals gradually wrested the right to lead society from the ks&#x301;atriyas and maintained their supremacy in society with the help of ks&#x301;atriya power.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..107"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=107 type=paragraph -->Although the ks&#x301;atriyas remained alert, once they submitted to the intellectuals, to the vipras, the Ks&#x301;atriya Age ended.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..108"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=108 type=paragraph -->The vipras compiled the Puranas and wrote the glorious history of the ks&#x301;atriyas. Right in that history they made it clear that it was the dharma of the powerful ks&#x301;atriyas to worship the vipras. Those powerful ks&#x301;atriyas could not see through this strategy. In simple faith they submitted to the intelligent, shrewd and deceitful vipras.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..109"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=109 type=paragraph -->An examination of history reveals that the ca&#x301;turvarn&#x301;ika<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.3.fn9"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#3.fn9">9</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> social system existed throughout the world and that it has continued and is still continuing according to a special type of parikra&#x301;nti [peripheric evolution] of the sama&#x301;ja cakra [social cycle]. The most amusing part about it is that when the Ks&#x301;atriya Age evolved out of the unsystematic Shu&#x301;dra Age, the shu&#x301;dras considered the Ks&#x301;atriya Age a great blessing. The shu&#x301;dras could not envisage the ks&#x301;atriyas as exploiters or possible exploiters. Similarly, when the ks&#x301;atriyas sold all their strength to the intellectual vipras, the ks&#x301;atriyas did not realize that it had been sold and that they were gradually being bound in chains like slaves. Still later, when the vipras sold themselves to the money of the vaeshyas &ndash; when Sarasvatii [the goddess of knowledge] became the slave of Laks&#x301;mii [the goddess of wealth] &ndash; the vipras at first did not realize that their value was going to be measured in financial terms.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..110"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=110 type=paragraph -->The intellectual exploitation of the vipras reduced the ks&#x301;atriyas to the level of powerful animals, and the cunning minds of the vipras started to control the strength of the ks&#x301;atriyas.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..111"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=111 type=paragraph -->When we read in history the accounts of the great kings, it appears as though all these events belonged to the Ks&#x301;atriya Age. But was that really the situation? A somewhat deeper analysis shows that nearly all the kings were at the beck and call of their vipra ministers. In almost every country we observe the hard fact that even the most powerful and mighty kings were mere puppets in the hands of their vipra ministers. In fact, it is not totally incorrect to say that the history of the monarchy was the history of the &ldquo;minister-archy&rdquo;. Vipra ministers protected the common people from the whims of the undisciplined ks&#x301;atriya monarchy and from the militaristic discipline of the ks&#x301;atriyas, and introduced into society a discipline that was supported to some extent by the common people. A disciplined kingdom therefore really meant the subordination of the power of the monarch to the vipras.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..112"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=112 type=paragraph -->The contribution of Aniruddha Bhatta to the social system evolved by Ballal [Sen] cannot be denied; the wisdom of Purandar Khan was the guiding influence behind the peace and order in the kingdom ruled by Hussain Shah; and Chandragupta was merely a puppet in the hands of Chanakya.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..113"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=113 type=paragraph -->Once the ks&#x301;atriyas submitted to the vipras, the vipras, with their sharp intellect, tried to construct a well-knit social system. Though they recognized the king as the supreme head of government, so far as the social system was concerned, they declared the king to be the servant of the vipras. They did not grant him the right to interfere in religious matters, because it was through the religious structure that they found an opportunity to establish themselves. So the ks&#x301;atriya kings became the &ldquo;defenders of religion&rdquo; and the &ldquo;servants of the vipras&rdquo; in the social system created by the vipras.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..114"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=114 type=paragraph -->Once the common people had become part of the social system created by the vipras, if it became apparent that a king wanted to free himself from the vipras&#146; domination, the vipras would use their intellectual power to summon up the support of the masses and, after humbling the proud king, would install a new king on the throne. Thereby the vipras secured their own rule.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..115"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=115 type=paragraph -->The efforts of aware ks&#x301;atriyas to free themselves from the influence of the vipras can be called ks&#x301;atriya vikra&#x301;nti [counter-evolution] or ks&#x301;atriya prativiplava [counter-revolution].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..116"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=116 type=paragraph -->There are more dishonest vipras than dishonest ks&#x301;atriyas. So most of the intellectual capabilities of the vipras are employed in appropriating a share of the hard-earned wealth of others. Ks&#x301;atriyas use the shu&#x301;dras as tools, and vipras use their subtlety to neutralize or to activate the vital energy of the ks&#x301;atriyas, according to their own wishes. Hence when the Vipra Age began at the end of the Ks&#x301;atriya Age, and the ks&#x301;atriyas lay their weapons with complete trust at the feet of the vipras, they did not realize that they had sold themselves to cheats. The illusion of escaping the misfortunes of this life, and going to heaven in the next, clouded their simple minds. All the special qualities, the merits and demerits, congruities and incongruities of the ks&#x301;atriyas&#146; mentality were at the fingertips of the vipras, so the vipras achieved their objectives by exploiting the weaknesses of the ks&#x301;atriyas, giving condescending encouragement to their simplicity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..117"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=117 type=paragraph -->Employing the ks&#x301;atriyas&#146; own resources of vital energy to suck dry their vitality, the vipras found the opportunity to gratify their own desires. The vipras&#146; power of mind and power of speech are much subtler than the physical brawn of the ks&#x301;atriyas, so the vipras did not have any particular difficulty in turning the ks&#x301;atriya occupation into a form of slavery through pressure of circumstances. Those who establish themselves in society through a display of physical strength will certainly be proud of their strength. The vipras used their intelligence to exploit this weakness-born-of-strength of the ks&#x301;atriyas. By praising the strength of the ks&#x301;atriyas, the vipras destroyed what little intellect they had and gained control of their strength. Just as a small mahout can control an unruly elephant, the vipras controlled the ks&#x301;atriyas through an understanding of their inner weakness: the pride they had in their strength. The crown on the head of the ks&#x301;atriyas considered itself fortunate to be used as a footstool under the feet of the vipras.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="4..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The intellect of intelligent people can penetrate where the rays of the sun cannot. Such people want to enjoy matter without being subservient to it. In other words, they want to control matter with their mental waves. It is not only ks&#x301;atriyas who do this, but vipras as well. The fundamental difference between ks&#x301;atriya-hood and vipra-hood is that the ego of the ks&#x301;atriyas draws objects of enjoyment to itself through a physical struggle with all opposing forces, while the ego of the vipras or their desire for enjoyment draws matter to itself either by the physical force of others through physical clash, or directly through psychic clash but avoiding physical clash, or through physical or psychic clash or both according to the demands of the situation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The salient feature of vipra life is that they enjoy the glory of victory and avoid the ignominy of defeat, and that in their personal lives they satisfy their desires for enjoyment without taking great risks. Like ks&#x301;atriyas, vipras are constantly engaged in fighting, but their fight takes place on the battleground of the intellect. Thus, vipras are intellectuals.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->They do not use their intellectual development only to accumulate material wealth; they also surpass all others in their capacity to accumulate subtle psychic wealth. Their intellectual endowment and intuitional longing are especially helpful in awakening agrya&#x301;buddhi [pinnacled intellect]. And although there is no ideological difference between pleasure-seeking vipras and ks&#x301;atriyas in terms of psychic dynamism, those vipras who develop a pinnacled intellect are very different from ks&#x301;atriyas.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The awakening of the pinnacled intellect, together with the momentum of that intellect, enables it to reach almost the highest stance of subtlety, so its movement is in a straight line. Its momentum has speed and moves in all directions. It contains within itself all the varn&#x301;as [mental colours], which is why vipras are the embodiment of whiteness &ndash; their colour is white. As they express themselves less through their motor organs than do ks&#x301;atriyas, blood-red, the symbol of spiritedness, cannot be their colour.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->But how many white vipras are there, who try to develop a pinnacled intellect? Most vipras are busy accumulating objects of enjoyment with the help of the physical strength of others, like parasites. In this chapter, when I use the term vipra, I mean this inferior type of vipra. I will talk later about the superior white vipras, or sadvipras, who try to develop a pinnacled intellect.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.4.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#4.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..6"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Vipra Society<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Vipras make use of the back-breaking labour of the shu&#x301;dras and the powerful personalities of the ks&#x301;atriyas to achieve their objectives. Shu&#x301;dras help build society with their physical labour and ks&#x301;atriyas help with their powerful personalities. Enticing them both, the vipras exact the physical labour of the shu&#x301;dras, and purchase the personal force of the ks&#x301;atriyas. If they see a towering mountain blocking the path of social progress, vipras do not sit back in despair or worship the obstacle as a god (or worship a particular disease as a goddess<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.4.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#4.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> ) &ndash; in a way worshipping their own helplessness &ndash; like the shu&#x301;dras; neither do they leap fearlessly into the ocean of action like the ks&#x301;atriyas. They use their intellects to plan victory over their enemies; the ks&#x301;atriyas and shu&#x301;dras translate these plans into action at the cost of their lives. The vipras march to the fore over the ks&#x301;atriyas&#146; and shu&#x301;dras&#146; dead bodies and proclaim to the world, "Look at what I did. Just see how I won victory." The pages of history are full of examples of the indirect struggles of the vipras.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->The characteristic similarities and differences between ks&#x301;atriyas and vipras are clearly evident in every aspect of life. Ks&#x301;atriyas and vipras are identified not by their similarities but by their differences. The most important difference is that ks&#x301;atriyas try to enslave matter directly by fighting with it, whereas vipras, using their intellects, try to enslave the ks&#x301;atriyas (who can then triumph over matter). The path of the ks&#x301;atriyas is straightforward &ndash; there is no scope for duplicity; the path of the vipras is crooked from beginning to end &ndash; there is no scope for simplicity. Whatever simplicity vipras exhibit is merely a veneer to hide their crookedness. A body of people with a vipra mentality is called vipra society.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->It should be kept in mind that words such as shu&#x301;dra, ks&#x301;atriya and vipra [as used in this book] have no connection with the varn&#x301;a&#x301;shrama system of ancient Hindu society. However, it is a fact that those who became vipras by virtue of their intellect declared that the vipras were a hereditary caste in order to perpetuate their own authority in society. They showed the ks&#x301;atriyas, whom they had defeated and who had submitted to them, a little mercy by giving them a social position just under themselves. (Actually this was not done out of mercy but so they could put them to work in the future.)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..10"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Intellectual Exploitation<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Vipras use all their abilities for intellectual exploitation. They try to gain prestige in society and maintain that prestige by composing mythological stories which play on the weaknesses of the human mind; by preaching the divine power of certain gods and goddesses under certain circumstances; by convincing people of the vipras&#146; social superiority; and by injecting the confusion of religion even into spirituality. They spend most of the mental resources of their precious lives scheming to gain prestige and plotting to maintain it.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->If one reads the scriptures of any religious community, one will find ample examples of this. Even if one undergoes austerities, practises ritualistic fasting, undertakes pilgrimages, bathes in holy rivers and springs, worships a sacred fire or studies the scriptures, one will not be blessed unless one also offers sacerdotal fees to the vipras. Only the vipras are authorized to recite even ordinary pa&#x301;nca&#x301;lii [long folk poems] about laokik gods and goddesses<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.4.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#4.fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> &ndash; and needless to say, a vipra would never visit anybody to recite such poems without remuneration.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Occasionally even sinful, antisocial elements are led to believe that if they frankly confess their sins to a vipra, the vipra through his special efforts will obtain a dispensation saving them from the consequences of their sins; every intelligent person knows that a vipra will never act as an agent of God without some remuneration. Just see the way sins are condoned!<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Even so, vipras have more capacities than ks&#x301;atriyas. A ks&#x301;atriya seeks happiness only through physical enjoyment, but a vipra is capable of some mental enjoyment as well, however little it may be.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Disasters occur when there is a lack of balance between people&#146;s physical and intellectual efforts. If the reins of society are in the hands of people who suffer from such imbalances, society as a whole will suffer the consequences of those disasters.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->The amount of intellectual labour performed by shu&#x301;dras is negligible compared to their physical labour. Although the intellectual labour of ks&#x301;atriyas is not completely meaningless, it does not have much practical value.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Even if a vipra administration does not itself create disasters, it will not be able to prevent them from occurring for long. What happens with the vipras is that [intellect] is given a higher valuation than the application of physical force. Thus under a vipra administration others work to enhance the vipras&#146; prestige and to maintain the vipras&#146; standard of living, while the vipras use their intellect to live an unbalanced life and to suck the vitality of others like parasites.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Where there is more physical clash in life, physical force will increase faster than intellect or the expression of intellect, and likewise, where there is much psychic clash, there will be only the expression of intellect, coupled with a gradual but eventually severe increase in physical indolence. From a psychological point of view, people dominated by intellect in this way gradually become more and more atrophied, so that whatever magnanimity exists at the beginning of the Vipra Age is lost by the end of the age. The end result of this lack of magnanimity is that the vaeshyas become dominant in society. At the beginning of the Vipra Age the vipras provide advice about how to protect society as well as how to exploit it; they also take advice from others about how to protect and exploit it. But by the end of the Vipra Age the vipras only give advice but no longer accept it, and the advice they give concerns only how to exploit.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..19"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->How the Vipras Evolve<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->In the Ks&#x301;atriya Age, those who were defeated by physical force and military strength resorted to intellectual strategems in an effort to win victory. The psychic clash they experienced in their long, drawn-out struggle for victory developed their intellects. The original fathers of the vipras were those who first used their intellects to exploit the strength of the strong.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.4.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#4.fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> Ks&#x301;atriyas, shu&#x301;dras and relatively-undeveloped vipras came to be exploited by the fathers of the vipras, whom they recognized as their gotra [clan] leaders (or patriarchs), or recognized as founders of a pravar [lineage]. In some countries this gotra-pravar system still exists.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->Ks&#x301;atriyas who developed vipra intellectual abilities due to psychic clash while under vipra intellectual guidance were responsible for the continuation of vipra dominance. Actually, just as those shu&#x301;dras who had been influenced by ks&#x301;atriyas had perpetuated ks&#x301;atriya society, it was those ks&#x301;atriyas who had been influenced by vipras who perpetuated vipra society.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->We see from the past that when, in a natural process, social dominance passed out of the hands of the ks&#x301;atriyas and into those of the vipras, though still within the ks&#x301;atriya succession, the main reason was that at that time most ks&#x301;atriyas were ks&#x301;atriyas in name only, but were actually shu&#x301;dras. Similarly, at the time the vipras fell from authority, though the vipra succession went on, it could be observed that those who were vipras in name only outnumbered the vipras themselves, that is, the genuine intellectuals.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Why did this occur?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..24"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->The Social Cycle and the Right of Inheritance<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->The rule of the social cycle is that the Shu&#x301;dra Age is followed by the Ks&#x301;atriya Age, the Ks&#x301;atriya Age is followed by the Vipra Age, and the Vipra Age is followed by the Vaeshya Age, which is followed by social revolution. This kind of social rotation is the inexorable law of nature.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->Even during the period of their dominance, ks&#x301;atriyas and vipras both understood (at least) that as nothing in the world stays the same forever, their dominance as well would one day come to an end, and that too due to their unworthiness. For this reason they extolled the right of inheritance and attached greater importance to it than to individual capacity &ndash; so that regardless of his ability, the son of a king would become a king and wear the laurels of ks&#x301;atriya victory, and however foolish or stupid, the heir of a vipra would be respected by society and enjoy the privileges of a vipra. Subsequently the same thing occurred in vaeshya society.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->It can be observed that in the Ks&#x301;atriya Age power gradually passes into the hands of non-ks&#x301;atriyas who are ks&#x301;atriyas in name only, and in the Vipra Age power passes into the hands of non-vipras who are vipras in name only, all in the name of hereditary rights. But it is impossible for such unworthy people to maintain their hold on power. Under such circumstances power passes out of the hands of the ks&#x301;atriyas and into the hands of the vipras, and later passes again from the hands of the vipras to the hands of the vaeshyas; and when the dominance of the oppressive vaeshyas becomes intolerable the common people revolt, thus starting a new chapter in the social cycle.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..28"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->Satanic Vipras<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->The development of human society that comes in the wake of the lustrous vitality of the ks&#x301;atriyas becomes somewhat subdued among the vipras. That vitality gradually surrenders to intellectuality. The strength and sincerity demonstrated in the practical sphere by the ks&#x301;atriyas in their efforts to conquer matter and consciousness is not matched by the vipras. Vipras certainly do use their intellect to try to acquaint themselves with consciousness, but they do not try to conquer matter through the application of their own physical strength &ndash; that also they try to do using intellect as their capital. Through their intellect they use the strength of the ks&#x301;atriyas to conquer matter.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->At the slightest sign from the vipras, major wars break out in different countries and states. The vipras themselves do not fight. By whispering of war in the ears of the king, they send ks&#x301;atriya generals into battle. Ks&#x301;atriya soldiers, running the risks for the vipras, wage war on land, on sea and in the air, and the vipras, understanding their physical and mental weaknesses, entice them with food or money, or inspire them with hollow, idealistic-sounding slogans, and land them in a holocaust.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->Thus in the Vipra Age ks&#x301;atriyas fight and die while shrewd vipra ministers receive triumphant ovations. This happens in every country where vipras play a dominant role. The names of vipra ministers are blazoned across the pages of history, but history does not record the numbers of soldiers who died on the battlefield or how many of them saw their golden dreams fade into darkness under cannon fire.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->When a vipra minister dies, the newspapers write it up elaborately. Condolence meetings are held; condolence messages come in by the thousands; flags are flown at half mast; and marble statues are erected at intersections in public parks. But the press will never acknowledge the ks&#x301;atriyas whose blood enriched the ground for the harvest of victory. And actually, why should they? How can so many names be published in a newspaper anyway!<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->All the great warmongers, the great politicians of the world, belong to this vipra gang of satanic intellect. At their command, or due to their fiery lectures or diplomatic intrigues, millions of foolish shu&#x301;dras have lost their lives and thousands of hot-blooded ks&#x301;atriyas have served as instruments in the slaughter.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->The pages of world history reveal that all the crusades and jihads of the Middle Ages were plotted by these satanic vipras. Caught in their intrigues, the shu&#x301;dras took the beatings; and the ks&#x301;atriyas fought as religious warriors, but never thought deeply about whom they were fighting for.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->Was it only in the Middle Ages that this happened? In today&#146;s world also, satanic vipras, the protected agents of the capitalist vaeshyas, have led and are continuing to lead millions of people along the path of death and destruction. Evil vipras are fanning the flames of the vaeshyas&#146; insatiable, demonic hunger. Neither the shu&#x301;dra masses nor the warlike ks&#x301;atriyas are responsible for the problem of the millions of refugees in different countries, for the heart-rending cries of the mothers, wives, sons and daughters of the soldiers who died on the battlefields, for the blazing flames of communal<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.4.fn5"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#4.fn5">5</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> riots, for communalism itself, provincialism, nationalism and casteism. The responsibility lies with a small group of shrewd vipras who, out of petty self-interest, have instigated the shu&#x301;dras and ks&#x301;atriyas to commit heinous acts.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..36"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph -->The meanness and brutality of such vipras put on a ghoulish graveyard dance, seeming to make a mockery of the vipras&#146; intellect. In the Vipra Age the vipras drew power from this type of brutality, and through a staged display of black magic, vipras bestrode society. In the Vaeshya Age the vipras commit similar sins in order to shine like fancy shoes on the feet of the vaeshyas.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..37"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=37 type=paragraph -->Have vipras only exploited others? Although they have done more to exploit others than to serve them, and although their service was motivated by the desire to exploit, the list of those services has been considerable. The ks&#x301;atriyas conquered the physical world through fight, whereas the vipras wormed their intellect into the wealth won by the ks&#x301;atriyas. Whereas the ks&#x301;atriyas&#146; intellect was only capable of obtaining objects, the vipras&#146; intellect in the Vipra Age was able to devour them.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..38"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=38 type=paragraph -->But even in the vipras&#146; action of devouring, there is one speciality, and that is, although they demarcated everyone&#146;s field of activity, they allowed people the scope to express themselves within that demarcated area. Even though the vipras exploited and enslaved the ks&#x301;atriyas, they did not curb their martial nature or deny them the opportunity to display their heroism. And although they were reluctant to recognize the shu&#x301;dras as human beings, they nevertheless allowed them an opportunity to survive. In the history of human progress and of the effort to establish human superiority over matter, we would be overlooking an important fact if we failed to mention this speciality of the Vipra Age.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..39"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=39 type=paragraph -->The Idea of Supernatural Phenomena<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..40"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=40 type=paragraph -->The vipras were successful due to their intelligence. They not only defeated the ks&#x301;atriyas in intellectual battles but also filled them with awe. Whatever primitive human weaknesses the ks&#x301;atriyas were unable to overcome, the vipras would take advantage of to exploit them and the rest of society &ndash; that is, the shu&#x301;dras &ndash; and this goes on even today.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..41"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=41 type=paragraph -->Whenever they would intellectually defeat the ordinary people, the vipras would cleverly introduce the idea of supernatural phenomena in order to achieve their objectives. In reply to the question, "Where do people go after they die?" undeveloped people had themselves developed the concept of ghosts as the answer. Any frightful or distressing events of the everyday world that could not be understood were attributed to ghosts. The vipras capitalized on this fear of ghosts by becoming exorcists and tricking the vaeshyas and ks&#x301;atriyas out of their money. Did not the intelligent vipras know that if a ghost is a mental creation, "possession by a ghost" must be just a mental disease? Whether we know the causes of paranormal events or not, they certainly have nothing to do with ghosts.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..42"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=42 type=paragraph -->Knowing full well that a person who is possessed by a ghost is suffering from a mental disease and a disease of the nervous system, exorcists generally beat a "possessed" person to reactivate his or her nerves, make him or her inhale the smoke of burnt chillies in order to return him or her to consciousness, or use numerous psychological techniques to cure his or her mental disease, but they never disclose to anybody what they are actually doing. Instead they inarticulately mutter meaningless mantras and even today make people believe that, due to the force of their psychic power or so-called Tantra sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; [spiritual practices], pretasiddhi [power to control ghosts] or pisha&#x301;casiddhi [power to control evil spirits], the ghosts and demons will be compelled to flee.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..43"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=43 type=paragraph -->Exorcists tell stories about the various supernatural activities of ghosts or about offering food to manes at Gaya to make a patient concentrate his or her mind. The patient&#146;s concentrated mind may then break the branch of a tree or crack a parapet of the roof, but the vipra exorcists claim that such occurrences are caused by the fleeing ghost and are proof of the power of their mantras. Actually ghosts never kill people, only vipras do.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..44"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=44 type=paragraph -->Indeed, vipras earn considerable amounts of money from the public by preaching about the tremendous importance of religiosity and not straying from the path of religiosity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..45"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=45 type=paragraph -->Visions of gods and goddesses or so-called saints is the same type of thing as possession by ghosts. Don&#146;t vipra priests really know that those who receive medical guidance or divine revelations by prostrating themselves before a temple or a saint&#146;s mausoleum for days together without taking food and water, actually experience nothing more than the workings of their own intuition? Had the vipras not known this, they would not have persistently stressed the importance of faith to their followers. Vipras understand that when through faith the crude mind reaches the realm of the subtle mind and the subtle mind reaches the realm of the intuition, it is the intuition, the innate repository of infinite knowledge, that enlightens the intellect. But the person who receives the medical guidance or divine revelation believes that it comes from the deity he or she was worshipping. If one&#146;s faith is not strong enough there will be a lack of concentration and the intellect will not be able to cross the threshold of the aham [ego] and enter the realm of the intuition. Consequently it will not be possible for the person to receive medical guidance or a divine revelation from his or her so-called deity. Vipra priests understand this and tell those with little faith, "You had better go. Your prayers will not be answered." Had the deity actually been watchful the question of the presence or absence of faith would not have arisen; everybody would have received medical guidance or a divine revelation.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="4..47"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=47 type=paragraph -->Intellect controls crude physical force. Therefore ks&#x301;atriyas, who have both intellect and physical strength, make the shu&#x301;dras work according to their will either at the snap of their fingers at bayonet point. And vipras, who are physically weaker but intellectually stronger than the ks&#x301;atriyas, control the ks&#x301;atriyas&#146; finger snap and raised bayonet through their sharp intellect.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..48"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=48 type=paragraph -->The vipras&#146; victory is intellectual victory; it would be meaningless without the support of the ks&#x301;atriyas&#146; swords and the shu&#x301;dras&#146; back-breaking labour. In fact, vipras use their nerve cells almost exclusively in their fights; they make very little use of their nerve fibres. The work of the nerve fibres is done by the obedient ks&#x301;atriyas and shu&#x301;dras.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..49"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=49 type=paragraph -->Many major wars have been fought in the history of the world. Millions of unintelligent shu&#x301;dras and thousands of unintelligent but brave ks&#x301;atriyas have lost their lives, but the laurels of victory have always gone to the vipra ministers who have never so much as glanced at a battlefield from a distance. Ask any historical analyst, "Who won victory for Great Britain in the Second World War?" and he or she will immediately reply, "The Prime Minister of Great Britain, Mr. Churchill." He or she will never mention the millions of British soldiers who fought for Britain with the last drop of their blood, or the hundreds of thousands of scientists, artisans, technicians, clerks, doctors and military officers who saved the prestige of Britain through their tireless efforts. It was as if the combined endeavours of millions of such people, the movements of their nerves and muscles, became eclipsed by the intellect of Churchill.<!-- /block --></p>

That historic moment was the starting point of the Vipra Age, the era dominated by the vipras.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..51"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=51 type=paragraph -->But did the ks&#x301;atriyas surrender their vigour and martial skills in a sudden way? No, it took a long time. The vipras gradually used their intellectual power to bring the activities of the comparatively dull-witted ks&#x301;atriyas under a kind of psychic control. The ks&#x301;atriyas surrendered exactly at the point where the intellectual pressure of the vipras had brought their powerful personalities under control.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..52"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=52 type=paragraph -->The vipras had scientific minds, and when they knew that some type of natural calamity or beneficial natural event was about to occur, they would present those events to the ks&#x301;atriyas as expressions of their supernatural powers. The ks&#x301;atriyas would be filled with awe and think that if the possessors of such miraculous powers cursed them, a disaster might befall them, but if the vipras blessed them, they might be able to conquer the world. Spellbound by such thoughts, the ks&#x301;atriyas surrendered all their abilities to the intellectual power of the vipras.<!-- /block --></p>

They would utilize this knowledge to defeat their opponents, saying, "The world will soon be covered in darkness due to the power of our curse." After some time the eclipse would occur and the world would become dark. Their opponents would believe that it was really the result of the vipras&#146; curse, and would surrender to them in a state of fear and panic.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..54"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=54 type=paragraph -->The vipras deceived the ks&#x301;atriyas in many such ways; sometimes they made use of ordinary stage magic to achieve their ends, and sometimes they confounded the ks&#x301;atriyas by psychological means.

Later, when the vipras began to become dominant, [at least] one ks&#x301;atriya group would form in the same way around an individual vipra, or so-called wise man. Needless to say, there would in turn be many shu&#x301;dra groups around each ks&#x301;atriya group. Each ks&#x301;atriya group would adopt a gotra [clan] name according to the name of the vipra leader around whom the various groups clustered, and also a pravar [ancestral lineage] name according to the name of a deputy vipra leader. Thus evolved the gotra-pravar system which still prevails in Hindu society.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.4.fn6"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#4.fn6">6</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> When ks&#x301;atriya groups adopted vipra names according to the gotra-pravar system, that was the beginning of the end of the Ks&#x301;atriya Age.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="4..61"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=61 type=paragraph -->Although vipras were proud of their learning and wanted to lead society, their aristocratic status did not result from that desire. Though their aversion to manual labour turned them into a kind of social parasite, they tried to establish themselves socially by performing social service and disseminating knowledge. This redeeming quality of a handful of vipras awakened in the minds of the ks&#x301;atriyas and shu&#x301;dras a special type of love for vipras. Because of this love, even though they were exploited, they did not bother about it. They thought, "What is the harm if the vipras take a part of what I&#146;ve earned through my bravery, strength, intellect or physical labour."<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..62"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=62 type=paragraph -->The belief that serving vipras was the stepping-stone to heaven became firmly rooted in their minds.

Although most common people could not understand why, their devotion to the vipras or to the spirituality propagated by the vipras helped them to progress spiritually and to assimilate sublime ideas. It would certainly be inappropriate for people to hold a grudge against the vipras and refuse to recognize this important fact.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..64"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=64 type=paragraph -->The ks&#x301;atriyas fought to defend themselves, to protect others and to create a social legacy. The vipras utilized all their intellectual power in the intellectual field to protect the mentally-undeveloped ks&#x301;atriyas and shu&#x301;dras, so that with their help they themselves could survive, and their own professional needs, subsistence and security would be taken care of; and so that they could become the supreme rulers of society.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..65"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=65 type=paragraph -->The vipras&#146; total application of intellect made them debaters, logicians and metaphysicians. Such mental expressions addressed neither the spiritual world nor the physical world particularly.

<a name="4..67"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=67 type=paragraph -->In the process of criticizing the vipras, we must not overlook the fact that human fraternity, universalistic intellect, the use of the influence of material wealth, and the peak of mental attainment were contributions of the Vipra Age.

<a name="4..69"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=69 type=paragraph -->The onward march of intellect, in order to put the social system built by the ks&#x301;atriyas on a basis of collective welfare, many times destroyed, then rebuilt, the structure of that system. The vipras would continually write new social codes, basing those new codes on different factors such as environment, social needs, human nature, post-war social reactions, and the blood-mixing of different groups. In order to maintain their control, they had based their machinery of exploitation on so-called spiritual scriptures which they declared to be superhuman revelations (supposedly given by God alone and not by human beings) and therefore immutable. Nevertheless they did recognize that it was necessary to change the social system in order to meet the needs of the age.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..70"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=70 type=paragraph -->In this regard it is an incontrovertible fact that the vipras were more broad-minded than the ks&#x301;atriyas. Time and again in their social system the ks&#x301;atriyas had demonstrated a kind of obstinacy characteristic of foolish dictators; whereas the vipras at least did not make this mistake. The reason for this is quite clear. The prestige of the ks&#x301;atriyas derived from their dictatorship, and so by any means they wanted to maintain this system. But the prestige of the vipras was based purely on intellectual supremacy, and so, after ensuring that they had sufficient scope for intellectual exploitation, they considered it expedient to keep pace with the requirements of the age.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..71"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=71 type=paragraph -->If the vipras had admitted that scriptures were written by human beings (such as those written by Manu), they would have lost their scope for exploitation. So they chose not to do this. But if they had claimed that their social scriptures (or social codes, or smrti sha&#x301;stra) were divine revelations, they would have missed out on the means of exploitation that were available in that era. This is why the vipras accepted that social codes could be changed.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..72"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=72 type=paragraph -->The vipras were inclined towards intellectual exploitation. Regardless of what they constructed or destroyed, they always made sure that they had sufficient scope to exploit people. The intelligent vipras understood that the path of exploitation was not the path of rationality and therefore they never walked that path, leading the ignorant instead down the path of blind faith. So when they set themselves to formulate social scriptures, they did so with an eye to their own convenience. Instead of supporting their views with rational arguments, they propagated high-sounding religious injunctions. That is why the degree of genuine humanity found in the ks&#x301;atriya social and matrimonial systems did not increase in the social and matrimonial systems of the vipras. The vipras merely covered what genuine humanity was already there with a veneer of religious fanaticism.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="4..74"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=74 type=paragraph -->The ks&#x301;atriyas tried to structure their social system and matrimonial relations to meet the needs of both men and women, but the vipras cleverly tried to maintain a permanent system for exploiting both women and ignorant, neglected men. They did not hesitate to employ any kind of cunning to keep power in the hands of a small group, out of fear that neglected people and women would claim that as human beings they should have the same rights as everyone else.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..75"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=75 type=paragraph -->The way in which the ks&#x301;atriyas rose to power varied from country to country, but the way in which the vipras rose to power was almost the same everywhere.

<a name="4..76"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=76 type=paragraph -->In the Vipra Age, as the dependence of women on men increased, the vipras turned women with vipra intellects into wageless slaves. Conspiring to cripple women in every sphere of life, they wrote "divine" commandments, many kinds of scriptural injunctions, many kinds of specious logic, and imaginary tales of pa&#x301;pa [vice] and pun&#x301;ya [virtue]. To hear or read such things one would think that men, especially vipra men, were alone blessed by God and that others were born only to provide them the wherewithals of enjoyment.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..77"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=77 type=paragraph -->The matrimonial system of the Ks&#x301;atriya Age regarded women as both the assistants and co-workers of men, but in the Vipra Age, though on paper women were considered sahadharmin&#x301;ii,<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.4.fn7"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#4.fn7">7</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> in practice they became servants or slaves.

<a name="4..78"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=78 type=paragraph -->Today in countries where the women work and the men only sit around and eat, the status of women is similar; the women of such countries are restless because they are strictly controlled by the men. In the developed countries, although women are called the "fair sex" and are shown respect through language and people&#146;s conduct, men are not prepared to accept that women should have equal rights.

<a name="4..79"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=79 type=paragraph -->In the Ks&#x301;atriya Age women were the partners of men; that is, they shared both good times and bad times, and shared the same social status.

<a name="4..80"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=80 type=paragraph -->In the Vipra Age, particularly in the middle of the Vedic Age, when the intellectuals became all-powerful in society, some women enjoyed the same social rights and dignity as men due to the legacy of the past and were called ja&#x301;ya&#x301;s,<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.4.fn8"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#4.fn8">8</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> but most women were treated only as objects of enjoyment. Society did not recognize that they had any abilities beyond those of conceiving and bringing up children. Such women were called bha&#x301;rya&#x301;s.

One or two women who appeared to have been given the opportunity to enjoy those rights did not actually win the rights, but through their great personalities established a kind of right with a type of force. The pandits of those days could not formally oppose this effort to establish their rights, but naturally such endeavours were not viewed favourably. Of course such women later commanded great respect in society, and still do today.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..82"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=82 type=paragraph -->Although it is universally true that no one gives anyone rights &ndash; rights have to be established by one&#146;s own efforts &ndash; I have nevertheless specifically mentioned this here because vipra society was not prepared to voluntarily respect women&#146;s rights.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..83"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=83 type=paragraph -->The dominance of group-mothers in the Ks&#x301;atriya Age completely disappeared in the Vipra Age. When knowledge first began to bloom in the Ks&#x301;atriya Age, women also would impart knowledge to others. They composed mantras and offered libations to sacrificial fires alongside the men. But in the Vipra Age women lost their prestige. Every attempt was made to totally enslave them. The right to participate in sacrifices was taken away and matriarchs were replaced by patriarchs. Opportunities to read scriptures were either withdrawn or drastically curtailed. Ignorant women had no alternative but to silently accept the supremacy of men.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..84"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=84 type=paragraph -->The Vipra Age was the age of male opportunists. While men had the opportunity to divorce their wives or to be loose in character, women had to follow a very strict code of conduct. If any such lapse or defect was found in a woman, she would lose all respect not only as a woman, but also as a human being. Yet when men committed the same crimes, they strutted about arrogantly as leaders of society.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..85"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=85 type=paragraph -->The Vaeshya Age followed the Vipra Age. But in the Vaeshya Age as well, we see that, as a legacy of the Vipra Age, women who have been abandoned by their husbands have not been respected by society. Even today, in places where society has not yet begun to feel the influence of shu&#x301;dra revolution, society follows the system of the Vipra Age in not open-mindedly accepting divorce. In such places women have been given some opportunities on paper, but in reality they still have to depend on the mercy of oppressive men.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..86"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=86 type=paragraph -->In the Vipra Age prostitution became a profession for the first time, because women were faced with loss of respect in society, economic difficulties and other worldly problems. It should be kept in mind that the profession of prostitution was not a phenomenon of the Shu&#x301;dra or Ks&#x301;atriya Age. It is possible to find some degree of bad character among both men and women due to the influence of base propensities, but this is not enough to create a large community of prostitutes in society. This sinful occupation is the creation of selfish vipras. Later, if I get the opportunity, I will discuss this subject in detail.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..87"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=87 type=paragraph -->In the Ks&#x301;atriya Age, a woman was considered to be the valuable property of a man. Although women did not have the same rights as men, they still commanded considerable respect. But in the Vipra Age the position of women became like that of cows, sheep and goats, no better than the other essential items of a household. In the Ks&#x301;atriya Age a woman was considered to be a "hero&#146;s reward", and abduction by the strong was considered a virtuous act, but in the Vipra Age this changed a little; in the Vipra Age a woman came to be considered a "pandit&#146;s reward". A woman had no existence in society without a husband.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..88"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=88 type=paragraph -->In some countries more than one woman might be compelled to be married to one man; devious means were employed to bring this about. By creating a fear of hell in the minds of women, by maintaining social strictures through severe punishment, and by crippling women economically, women were made so dependent on men that the very idea that polygyny might be unjust was effaced from their minds.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..89"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=89 type=paragraph -->In some countries unmarried girls were forced to marry old men on the verge of death on the curious pretext that it was sinful for a woman to lead an unmarried life.

Just as parents and other elders in the Vipra Age prayed, Puttra&#x301;dicchet para&#x301;jayam ["One should long to be outshone by one&#146;s children"] or Shis&#x301;ya&#x301;dicchet para&#x301;jayam ["One should long to be outshone by one&#146;s students"], their children not only tried to uphold the prestige of their families and of the lineages of their gurus, keeping in view their families&#146; and gurus&#146; traditions, but also, in carefully preserving that prestige, kept an ideal uppermost in their minds and moved towards that ideal. That is why the society of that era kept progressing step by step in the intellectual sphere: the thought of the ideal gave it no respite. Thus Vedic rs&#x301;is [sages] always exhorted people to move forward, saying that the mantra of a living society was Caraeveti, caraeveti ["Move on, move on"].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..110"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=110 type=paragraph -->Vipra society was far more firmly-knit than ks&#x301;atriya society had been. In ks&#x301;atriya society it had become necessary to select suitable brides and grooms for marriages in order to maintain the continuity of social traditions, but the personal wishes of the brides and grooms themselves were not disregarded. Grooms and families were selected after giving due consideration to the opinions of the brides and grooms themselves. But this was not the practice in the Vipra Age, when maintaining the continuity of social traditions became the primary consideration. Hence in the Vipra Age the scope for independent decisions regarding marriage disappeared, as undue importance began to be paid to the selection either of families or of grooms.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="4..113"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=113 type=paragraph -->The vipras&#146; culture was not for the common mass. No doubt it stimulated the nerves of a small handful of people, but it could not move in step with the general mass. Vipra artists wished, through their intellectual brilliance, to conquer the world. Through their poems, dramas, writings and drawings they induced common people to pay homage to the superiority of the intellectuals. But the ignorant people could not understand these big things. The common people thought, "What we cannot understand must be something great," and with this mentality fell obediently at the vipras&#146; feet.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..114"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=114 type=paragraph -->At times when the intellectual art and literature of the vipras failed to convince the common people of their greatness, the vipras composed countless fanciful pura&#x301;n&#x301;as [mythological tales], stories about gods and goddesses that satisfied their own standards, and colourful mythological tales, all designed to dazzle people&#146;s eyes and confound their intellects. They also warned the masses that if they failed to follow the teachings of these stories, or doubted their veracity, they would most certainly go to the deepest level of hell.<!-- /block --></p>

The ks&#x301;atriyas, as an expression of their svabha&#x301;va dharma [natural characteristics], had thought deeply about how to increase their numerical strength, and as a result &ndash; quickening the pace of human beings&#146; struggle against nature &ndash; had not only laid the foundation of the vast edifice of human civilization, but had also flung themselves into the task of constructing the walls. Similarly, the vipras&#146; expression of their natural characteristics induced them as well to increase their numbers, and for that reason increasing the number of their followers became one criterion of their vipra-hood. Of course in order to succeed in swelling the ranks of their followers, the vipras had to develop a due amount of proficiency; and their efforts to develop it served to build the roof on the edifice of human civilization.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..116"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=116 type=paragraph -->Phallus worship had been invented by the primitive, uncultured ks&#x301;atriyas as a symbol of increasing their population. The cultured vipras now interpreted it in a new way. They contended that the linga was a symbol for Parama Purus&#x301;a [Supreme Consciousness] and the piit&#x301;ha [vulva] a symbol for Prakrti [Supreme Operative Principle]. The interpretation the vipras gave was, Liun&#x32D;gate gamyate yasma&#x301;d talliun&#x32D;gam ["The entity from which everything originates [[and towards which everything is moving]] is called liun&#x32D;ga"] or Yasmin sarva&#x301;n&#x301;i liiyante talliun&#x32D;gam ["The entity in which everything merges is called liun&#x32D;ga"]. When examining the history of phallus worship one should not only consider the mentality of the ks&#x301;atriyas, but also give due consideration to the mentality of the vipras. However, the vipra interpretation has no relation to reality. Phallus worship belonged to primitive ks&#x301;atriya society.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..117"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=117 type=paragraph -->And not only phallus worship; most of the gods and goddesses described in the mythologies of different countries were representations of actual ks&#x301;atriya leaders. People in the Ks&#x301;atriya Age worshipped these gods and goddesses out of fear and devotion. Indra, Agni, Varuna, etc., of the Vedas had been mighty ks&#x301;atriya leaders. In the Vipra Age they came to function as gods after winning the support of various scriptures.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..118"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=118 type=paragraph -->The undeveloped ks&#x301;atriyas would worship all those leaders, or "gods", by offering them their (the ks&#x301;atriyas&#146;) favourite foods in order to propitiate them. After those leaders&#146; deaths, all such food would be burnt in a fire, thereby going to waste, for the supposed satisfaction of their souls in heaven. Even in the Vipra Age good-quality food and drink was destroyed by offering it to an imaginary god in a sacrificial fire. Moreover, the vipras received a commission for doing this.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..119"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=119 type=paragraph -->Later, after the vipras had fully established their dominance in society, they began to receive more than a mere commission. A sizeable part of the offerings intended for the sacrificial fires was not burnt, but found its way into their storerooms. That is, the shu&#x301;dras and ks&#x301;atriyas had become totally subservient to the vipras. Taking advantage of their tyrannical power and superior intellect, the vipras used every means to consolidate their system of exploitation. Regardless of whether a ceremony was concerned with religious practices, charitable activities, the first step in a child&#146;s pursuit of knowledge, harvesting crops, marriage, a baby&#146;s first solid food, commemoration of the dead, or anything else, a share in the [anticipated] benefits had to be offered to the vipras, otherwise the ceremony would not conclude in karmasiddhi [attainment]. And the vipras had to be feasted and paid, otherwise the ceremony would not produce any result.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..120"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=120 type=paragraph -->The vipra priests also adopted the different gods and goddesses that had been born out of the fear complex of the masses in the Shu&#x301;dra and Ks&#x301;atriyas Ages.

They also composed various types of dhya&#x301;na mantra<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.4.fn11"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#4.fn11">11</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> for such gods and goddesses; prescribed according to their own needs the specific materials that should be used for different kinds of worship of those deities; and, conveying strange commands from the deities at odd times, took to fleecing people out of donations, daks&#x301;in&#x301;a&#x301; [sacerdotal fees], sidha&#x301; [uncooked food given in exchange for a priest&#146;s services] and various types of materials to be used for worship.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..121"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=121 type=paragraph -->Another interesting thing about this is that in referring to the gods and goddesses created out of their fear complex, the shu&#x301;dras and ks&#x301;atriyas used colloquial language, while the vipras, in order to establish their supremacy and prove their intelligence, erudition and close relationship with God, used ancient languages. They always tried to make the masses believe that they, the masses, did not have the right of access to God, but had to go through the vipras. In other words, the vipras had a monopoly as agents in such matters.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..122"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=122 type=paragraph -->The vipras have invented and are still inventing new ways of exploiting different communities of people in different parts of the world. In some places they have lured people with the prospect of eternal heaven, injecting into them at the same time the fear of eternal hell. By claiming the doctrine of some particular vipra leader to be the word of God, they have blocked the natural expression of the human intellect and made people intellectually bankrupt. With the intention of permanently securing for themselves an exalted position in the eyes of the ordinary people, some vipra leaders have declared themselves to be the incarnation or the appointed prophet of God. Through their own so-called scriptures, they have indirectly let the common people know that no one can achieve the same proximity to God as they &ndash; so that an inferiority complex will remain forever in the minds of the masses, and due to this inferiority complex the masses will always follow their teachings, either out of fear or out of devotion. That is why even intellectual people have fallen into their trap and have been compelled to say, Vishva&#x301;se mila&#x301;y vastu, tarke vahu du&#x301;r ["The goal is achieved not by reason but by faith"] or Majhab men a&#x301;kl ka&#x301; dakhl nahii haen ["There is no room for reason in religion"].<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="4..124"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=124 type=paragraph -->If God is considered to be the perfect ideal, it will have to be accepted that God is always just. Even though God loves everyone, He punishes sinners. But it can be said that when He punishes sinners, His aim is not to give them pain but to rectify their behaviour. In my opinion this concept of God is the highest concept. If God is considered to be the Universal Father, He should not have any racial, national or communal feeling, or any other type of limited feeling. If this is true, how can the vipras contract that the soul of a certain dead person will reach heaven?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..125"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=125 type=paragraph -->I have heard that in some communities vipras claim to have the key to heaven. People even say that for the donation of a sum of money, vipras will sing akhan&#x301;d&#x301;a kiirtana [constant chanting of the name of God] on behalf of the donor to ensure his or her passage to heaven. It is said that if others sing spiritual songs and kiirtana in the donor&#146;s name, the donor will receive the benefit and go to heaven. What a wonderful philosophy for condoning sin!<!-- /block --></p>

Just as the dark frown of meanness and physical over-indulgence was offset in the ks&#x301;atriyas by a crimson glow of idealism and spiritedness, so in the vipras those defects were offset by the white brilliance of their intellects, which cannot be separated from devotion to an ideology. Even if it does momentarily get separated, it again becomes united, because intellectuality which does not adhere to an ideology cannot maintain its brilliance for long; it gets lost in the darkness of selfishness. So just as in the pages of ancient history we find countless examples of how the ks&#x301;atriyas, devoted to their ideology, died fighting to establish their prestige, we find similar examples of how the vipras, devoted to their ideology, fought to establish their doctrines, and either won, or died from the mental shock upon losing.<!-- /block --></p>

Those people are also to be regarded as vipras who have the desire to resist, protest or retaliate against the forcible imposition of certain doctrines on any person or group. These doctrines include not only religious doctrines, but also social, economic or political doctrines which may not strike at the powerful personality of any particular individual (i.e., may not affect ks&#x301;atriyas).<!-- /block --></p>

The names of generals and courageous soldiers have been recorded in the annals of history, and minstrels have composed epic songs in their honour, but the shu&#x301;dras who have shed their blood in the rank and file have remained unknown. The impact that ks&#x301;atriyas create through their heroism and powerful personalities have never gone unknown or unsung as regards the people of their era, because their impact was on that era itself; but shu&#x301;dras remain unknown, because although their contributions are recorded on the pages of time, they do not make an impact on people&#146;s minds. That is why no space is allocated by the newspapers to publish the news of their deaths and why a permanent grave with a tombstone for each of them is considered unnecessary. How can so much land be sacrificed for one man? They are buried in mass graves or thrown into the river half-cremated.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="4..135"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=135 type=paragraph -->The reason for this is very simple. Human beings have an innate attraction towards the old.

They cannot keep time with the new rhythm and prefer to stick to the old one. Thus vipras who develop something new face conflicts, acrimonious attacks and unwarranted criticism. But when the theories propounded by such vipras or their new inventions have been around for some time (it may be two or three months or two or three centuries), other open-minded, rational vipras wholeheartedly accept them and praise them, and are careful to see them become established.<!-- /block --></p>

For example, today mullahs and members of the clergy, and a group of gurus and priests of Hindu society, are incapable of seeing reason.

This type of thinking has created in the vipras the tendency to live a mechanical kind of religious life regardless of whether they have any reverence for God or not. This is called Yajet yas&#x301;t&#x301;avyamiti ["One should worship an entity simply because it ought to be worshipped"]. That is, regular worship, telling the beads, or prayer ought to be done so many times a day, at such-and-such time &ndash; and therefore we do it &ndash; this mentality is very much in evidence in a vipra.

The vipras understand the need for self-restraint in religious life and make some effort to become established in it. But the mixture of elements in their religious thinking causes them to use the religiously-inclined intellect that they have developed through self-restraint to establish themselves in the intellectual field.<!-- /block --></p>

Although those philosophies that revolted against both the philosophies and the exploitation of the vipras may not, from a subtle point of view, have been materialistic, they were without doubt atheistic. Some vipras tried to stay philosophically alive in the Vipra Age by writing newer and newer commentaries about their old philosophies, as a means of fighting against the atheistic philosophies. The Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;va&#x301;da evolved by Shankaracharya with the aim of demolishing the Buddhist atheism is an outstanding example.<!-- /block --></p>

Even though the control of the government appears to remain or remains on paper in the hands of the ks&#x301;atriyas, in reality those ks&#x301;atriyas are completely controlled by their intellectual vipra ministers. In the Vipra Age the ks&#x301;atriya kings do not want to bring trouble upon themselves by going against the counsels of their vipra ministers or of the priests of the royal family. In fact even if they want to, in most instances they are unable to; or even if they are able to, their actions, being an instance of counter-evolution or counter-revolution, are very short-lived. The kings of many countries in the Middle Ages acted in this way, or tried to do so, but none of them were successful, because they were living in the Vipra Age.<!-- /block --></p>

Secondly, the ks&#x301;atriyas and the shu&#x301;dras not only revered the intelligent, erudite vipras whom they followed, they also viewed the vipras&#146; descendants with respect and gave them places of honour. Irrespective of their abilities, the children of the vipras began to receive almost the same respect as their fathers.

<a name="4..176"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=176 type=paragraph -->In the Vipra Age the king sat on the throne, but in reality it was the vipra ministers who ruled.

The kings were puppets in the hands of their ministers, standing up and sitting down when they pulled the strings. The vipras did not want a democracy or republic exactly as we understand the terms. Whenever the possibility arose for a moment to establish a democracy or republic, the vipras would install the puppet ks&#x301;atriya of their choice on the throne.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..177"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=177 type=paragraph -->The vipras would try to take military assistance from the less-intelligent ks&#x301;atriyas in order to continue their march of exploitation unhindered. In the early part of the Vipra Age they created conflicts between one state and another and between one king and another centring around the conflicts between one religion and another. In order to continue their exploitation without hindrance, they tried to confuse people&#146;s judgement by shouting religious slogans and issuing various types of decree, thus inciting one group against another or one state against another in their effort to expand their area of exploitation; and in this they succeeded. The terrible wars and tremendous bloodshed that occurred in the world due to the ks&#x301;atriyas&#146; lust for power pale into insignificance before those that occurred in the Middle Ages at the direct or indirect instigation of the vipras, the standard-bearers of religion.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..178"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=178 type=paragraph -->In any society or governmental system where vipra rule lasted for a long time, different kinds of religion or moral philosophy came into being under their aegis. Initially the vipras had introduced religion for the purpose of exploitation and had tried to mislead people through their grandiloquence. However, the new philosophies that emerged in the course of time as a result of clash among vipras propagating different doctrines, came to be somewhat spiritual in appearance, though the tendency to exploit remained beneath the surface. This form of religion, like the form socialism adopted, was in fact a great hoax. With this approach, intellectual satans, instead of exploiting the faithful directly, expanded their sphere of exploitation behind a psychologically-designed mask of detachment from or indifference to worldly things.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..179"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=179 type=paragraph -->Vipras with a simple type of philosophy used to say, "Your father deserves to go to heaven, so make sure that we perform his funeral service," or "The soul of your father needs subtle food.

<a name="4..180"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=180 type=paragraph -->But later on the cunning vipras, whom I call intellectual satans, tried to turn the minds of the people from practical reality towards an imaginary void by preaching contrived philosophies. The essence of their voluminous treatises and verbose annotations to lengthy aphorisms was: the world is an illusion; therefore renounce the world and do not be attracted to its illusions. Become desireless, detached and self-abnegating by offering all your wealth at the feet of the vipras. Of course such philosophies did not preach that the world was also illusory for the vipras who received the offerings &ndash; clearly because it was through such ploys that they were able to achieve their objectives.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..181"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=181 type=paragraph -->In places where, for whatever reason, intellectual clashes among the vipras were not very intense, their philosophy was very simple. They would say to the people directly, "I am the angel or incarnation of God.

<a name="4..183"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=183 type=paragraph -->It is noticeable that in the fanatical religious communities that we see in the world today, there is very little intellectual clash among the vipras. However, whenever fanatical religious communities made systems of social rules and regulations &ndash; in other words, whenever they made some effort to build a social structure &ndash; their social systems would be stronger than those of societies which followed a subtle philosophical theory or those of ks&#x301;atriya societies. Where there were intellectual clashes among the vipras, each vipra would have his own supporters, and their different supporters would never think of themselves as belonging to the same group. As a result those vipras were unable to build a strong social structure. Though their philosophies may or may not have had some good in them, the Buddhists and Hindus were unable to build strong societies because of their subtle mentality.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="4..186"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=186 type=paragraph -->Whenever any ideology opposing exploitation tries to raise its head, the vested-interest group concerned will resist.

<a name="4..187"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=187 type=paragraph -->Groups of vipras may fight against each other, but they will quickly unite against an ideology that opposes vipra exploitation.

Thus it is clear that even when vipras belong to different groups, they readily unite to protect their mutual interests.

<a name="4..195"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=195 type=paragraph -->The ks&#x301;atriyas worshipped nature and regarded it as the collective form of different belligerent forces, and this concept of a collectivity came to be called Brahma.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.4.fn16"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#4.fn16">16</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  In their minds there was no difference between the collective form of nature and Brahma. They therefore came to regard all the phenomena of nature as expressions of Brahma. The vipras had a vague understanding of another type of expression which was beyond the realm of nature, which they called A&#x301;tma&#x301;, Parama&#x301;tma&#x301;, or Nirupa&#x301;dhika Iishvara [the Non-Attributional Controller]. According to the depth of their intellects, vipras had different ideas regarding the extent to which such expressions were beyond the realm of nature. Philosophically this is the reason why theoretical differences exist among Iishvara, Allah, God and Jehovah.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..196"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=196 type=paragraph -->Ruh, spirit, soul and a&#x301;tma&#x301; are not exactly the same thing. A ruh can rise up from the grave; a spirit can move around and frighten people; a soul can cone close to God and sit beside Him; while a non-attributional a&#x301;tma&#x301; is not bound by the bondages of time, space or person. This entity beyond the realm of nature was the contribution of the vipras. Their intellectual struggle against the hostile aspects of nature, assisted by the ks&#x301;atriyas, gave them the opportunity to imagine this kind of purus&#x301;a [consciousness] entity beyond the realm of nature.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..197"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=197 type=paragraph -->The religiosity of the ks&#x301;atriyas developed out of their infatuation with conquest and with acquisition. They thought that if they had faith in God they would be able to acquire a great deal of worldly wealth. They would acquire it through military force and enjoy it through military force. That is why ks&#x301;atriyas worshipped their imaginary gods and goddesses before going into battle or plundering wealth from others &ndash; in many cases sacrificing animals and even human beings to propitiate them.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..198"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=198 type=paragraph -->As the vipras lacked courage and valour of that kind, their spirituality was basically a fascination with acquiring occult powers. They thought that spirituality would bring them such power that their blessings would benefit people, who would then out of gratitude give the vipras a fat dividend out of whatever they had gained. They thought that spirituality could also give them the power to curse or do harm to people, who would then out of fear or devotion heap commodities at their feet. The pervasive efforts to create vipra dominance that can be observed in the stories of the Puranas are also born out of this mentality. According to some Puranas, not only human beings but Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a [God] Himself bore the footprints of the vipras on His chest.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..199"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=199 type=paragraph -->In the course of time the deceitful mentality of the vipras contributed greatly to the emergence of the vaeshyas as social exploiters.

The most important thing for the vipras was to "Live by making others small" &ndash; to make slaves of others by infusing inferiority complexes into their minds in order to suck dry their vital force and to terrorize them into submission &ndash; in order to establish their power. It is as if through the framework of society the vipras are saying: use deception, force, cunning or any other means at one&#146;s disposal in order to perpetuate one&#146;s exploitation, even if it results in temporary dishonour.<!-- /block --></p>

However, the importance the vipras give to individuality is detrimental to discipline. Although the idea of discipline is inherent in the fundamental principles or ideals of the vipras, their discipline is weakened by the emphasis they place on individual views. So although from a sociological perspective vipra society is superior to ks&#x301;atriya society (vipra society is, however, still not a "society" in the true sense of the term), its structure is looser because it gives greater importance to personal freedom.<!-- /block --></p>

The vipras who formulate social codes contend that even if society takes no action against sinners, they will still suffer the consequences of their sins in hell. Although in vipra society there is no system for eliminating the hunger of the oppressed, vipras say that it is virtuous to feed the hungry. And although in practice they support a system which discriminates against people on the basis of high and low, on paper they accept the idea that human beings are essentially brothers and sisters. So although the vipra social system is not as strong as that of the ks&#x301;atriyas, and although in practice it is generally lacking in magnanimity, on paper it is more magnanimous than that of ks&#x301;atriya society. Ks&#x301;atriyas cannot be said to be social parasites, but it is not incorrect to say that vipras are. Although the vipras understand the defects in their social system, they nevertheless use their grandiloquence to try to maintain it; such is the nature of vipras.<!-- /block --></p>

Of course vipras will not harm themselves for the sake of supporting others, no matter how great the logic in those people&#146;s favour or how great the religious obligation of the vipras to do so. Needless to say, vipras will never support anybody if, in the event of that person being made great or being fully accepted by society, their own chariot of exploitation would be brought to a halt; rather they will ignore all humanitarian considerations and harm such people much more than would the ks&#x301;atriyas.<!-- /block --></p>

Even today the leaders of some so-called religious organizations spend far more time in their meetings and institutes slandering and vilifying others, using diplomatic language to conceal their exploitative intentions, than they do talking about spiritual philosophy, the nature of God or spiritual sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; (that is, talking about real spiritual matters). But no matter how much they criticize each other, they are all believers in one doctrine, which is that it is not wrong to exploit people. Of course they put the seal of religion on their exploitation in order to further their own interests.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="4..214"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=214 type=paragraph -->To ks&#x301;atriyas life is like a game of chess, because they do what they have to do, even if it costs them their lives. The insatiable longing for victory compels them to behave in such a manner. A great, imperialistic leader and a most ordinary labourer equally welcome the call to a life of heroism and personal forcefulness. Ks&#x301;atriyas try to wash away their defeats and their sense of despair in the blood of the battlefield. But vipras behave differently. Vipras regard the winning of intellectual battles and invention of new types of intellectual expression as the highest values in life, and when their minds are completely engrossed in those highest values, they do not even think of exploiting others. At such times they are even prepared to undergo great pain and suffering for the sake of their ideology or beliefs.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..215"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=215 type=paragraph -->Other vipras cash in on the names of those magnanimous and ideological vipras, finding in them an opportunity to exploit others. Whatever respect people today may have for vipras is due to those ideological vipras. This is because more than ninety per cent of the intellectual and spiritual progress which humanity has so far achieved has been the legacy of those magnanimous and selfless vipras. Their contributions can never be forgotten in any age.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..216"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=216 type=paragraph -->Although the vipras&#146; collective life is not as happy as that of the ks&#x301;atriyas, they enjoy more peace. This is because they do not spend wakeful nights worrying about the possibility of mutual bloodshed. There is greater security in the society of the Vipra Age than in that of the Ks&#x301;atriya Age, because despite the extensive factional strife caused by ideological differences, the social structure is comparatively strong.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..217"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=217 type=paragraph -->Vipras are always awake and alert to what is going on around them, but their ability to respond appropriately to a situation is limited, as there is a lack of coordination between their intellects and their actions. When they have someone to work for them they are able to put their feelings and ideas into action, but if they do not have workers or obedient servants or someone to provide funds, most of their ideas come to nothing.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..218"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=218 type=paragraph -->People with intellect should not need more intellect, but the vipras do need more. This is because the vipras&#146; intellect is in most cases unproductive intellect. Something needs to be done to create a balance between their brains and their hands and feet; yet giving them advice serves no purpose, [because] they refuse to listen. They sell their intellects for money, but they are unable to find a balance between their intellect and their actions.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..219"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=219 type=paragraph -->The vipras ascertain the strength of an enemy and then incite the obedient ks&#x301;atriyas and shu&#x301;dras under their control to do battle, but they themselves stay at a safe distance. During the battle the heads of the brave ks&#x301;atriyas and the cowardly shu&#x301;dras roll in the dust and a river of blood flows on the earth, but the bodies of the vipras do not get even scratched. At the slightest possibility of defeat, they treacherously betray the shu&#x301;dras and ks&#x301;atriyas under them and enter into a secret pact with the enemy. Then they pose as peace-lovers and put the stigma of having fomented the war on the ks&#x301;atriyas.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..220"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=220 type=paragraph -->Thus vipra history is a history of adroit traitors. Within that history a high degree of intelligence is to be found, but no greatness. In it there are weakness, cowardice and ingratitude; and although there is cleverness, that cleverness is tarnished by selfishness.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..221"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=221 type=paragraph -->The Rise of the Vaeshyas<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..222"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=222 type=paragraph -->Because the vipras have so much confidence in their presence of mind they fail to think about the future; consequently they rarely bother to accumulate wealth. They think that they will always be able to make some arrangement in any situation. But this overconfidence leads to their downfall. When real danger arrives and their presence of mind fails them, they have to sell themselves to anyone with any kind of wealth.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..223"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=223 type=paragraph -->The vaeshyas, though endowed with less intelligence, begin to control the vipras with their capital. The subservient vipras then occupy themselves in increasing the wealth of the vaeshyas. Although they lack the capacity to accumulate wealth themselves, the vipras explain to the vaeshyas how to increase their wealth. The vipras show the vaeshyas all the straightforward and dirty ways of killing and cheating others that had escaped the vaeshyas&#146; attention. The vaeshyas evade taxes and indulge in black marketeering, smuggling and adulterating food and medicine, and increase their profits by paying bribes, but it is the vipras, grovelling at the feet of the vaeshyas, who supply the brains and the techniques behind these activities.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..224"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=224 type=paragraph -->But in the course of time the vipras lose even their intellectual originality. They become servants of the vaeshyas, agents of capitalism. In the vaeshya-dominated society the vipras become like the shu&#x301;dras and ks&#x301;atriyas: mere beasts of burden who carry bags of sugar without ever tasting its sweetness. The capitalist vaeshyas gradually wrest the right to lead society out of the hands of the vipras, and establish their dominance using the vipras&#146; intellectual force.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..225"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=225 type=paragraph -->Almost everywhere in the world the vaeshyas support democracy rather than monarchy, because in a monarchy the administration cannot be as easily influenced. People regard the bravery, tradition, noble birth and ks&#x301;atriya nature of a monarch with respect, or with a mixture of devotion and fear. For this reason they do not like to oppose a monarch unless he or she does something which severely undermines the interests of the people. If the monarch demonstrates even a little concern for the public interest, the lives and properties of the vaeshyas in that kingdom may at any time be endangered.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..226"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=226 type=paragraph -->In a party dictatorship or any other type of dictatorship, the dictator has to take into account the interests of the people. Even oppressive dictators cannot afford to ignore the welfare of the state, otherwise they will lose power. But in a democracy there is no danger of this.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..227"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=227 type=paragraph -->The unintelligent ks&#x301;atriyas and ignorant shu&#x301;dras are easily duped by the mind-stupefying, life-enchaining propaganda of the vaeshyas, assisted by their vipra servants. Even the vipras, despite their intelligence and despite whatever they may say or think, support the vaeshyas out of fear or due to lack of a proper alternative. Thus in a democratic structure, particularly in a structure where downfallen vipras and ks&#x301;atriyas<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.4.fn18"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#4.fn18">18</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> are few in number and ignorant shu&#x301;dras form the majority, the vaeshyas can easily win votes.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..228"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=228 type=paragraph -->During vaeshya rule the vipras&#146; intellect remains intact; it neither sleeps nor becomes rusty. However, though the vipras have intellect, they do not have the courage to apply it, because crude worldly bondages hold them tightly, like the grip of an octopus. It can therefore be said that the day that the vipras submit to the vaeshyas, the Vipra Age dies, even if the vipras themselves do not.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..229"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=229 type=paragraph -->The blood-sucking vaeshyas order the vipras whom they hire to write voluminous books which artfully distort the truth. They try to portray as mean and sub-human those who oppose the vaeshyas and demand the right to live. In order to keep their machinery of exploitation running, the vaeshyas produce deadly weapons with the help of mercenary vipras. On the orders of their vaeshya overlords, vipra scientists willingly or unwillingly take up the task of making weapons in their laboratories that have the potential to destroy human civilization.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..230"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=230 type=paragraph -->Although the vipras understand what is going on, they cannot do anything about it. They look up towards heaven, hoping to see the arrival of better days. They think, "When will the downfallen vipras, ks&#x301;atriyas and shu&#x301;dras unitedly save human civilization from the all-devouring greed of the vaeshyas. When will people realize that it is not the desire of providence for some to exploit others." Due to the utter despair they feel, the subservient vipras gradually become consumed with remorse recalling how they themselves once exploited others.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..231"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=231 type=paragraph -->The economic exploitation of the vaeshyas relegates the vipras to the level of intellectual satans, and the money of the vaeshyas controls the brains of those satans. In the Vaeshya Age intellectual progress occurs on many levels: new inventions are brought forth, new types of deadly weapon are invented, and people learn how to produce many types of commodity to increase comfort. Many people believe that these things are creations of the Vipra Age, but actually they are expressions of the Vaeshya Age. The vipras who sell themselves to the vaeshyas for money produce such items at their behest.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..232"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=232 type=paragraph -->A deep analysis reveals that many of those whose creative and inventive ability once commanded the respect of innumerable people, become dependent upon the mercy of the vaeshyas for their food and clothing. Poets and [[authors]] write according to the dictates of their vaeshya publishers or in the hope of winning prizes from the vaeshya-controlled governments. Artists wield their brushes according to the demands of the market, or are compelled to produce commercial art, neglecting more subtle art forms in the process. Instead of writing the truth, journalists turn day into night and night into day according to the wishes of profiteering newspaper publishers because they are afraid of losing their jobs. They go against their own consciences and pervert the truth in order to help unworthy people become leaders. They create spectacular lies with their pens.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..233"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=233 type=paragraph -->Of course there is another side to all this. If vipras engage themselves in intellectual development and research, it is difficult for them to meet their material needs. Because the vaeshyas finance them, this problem is solved, and they are able to work free of worry. But naturally the vaeshyas do not  extend their economic support in a disinterested way. Their ulterior motive is to establish themselves in society, and because of this the Vipra Age comes to an end.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..234"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=234 type=paragraph -->Economic Liberation<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..235"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=235 type=paragraph -->The subservient vipras employ all their intellectual power to increase the wealth of the vaeshyas in exchange for the basic necessities they need to fill their bellies. Millionaire vaeshyas employ vipras at low wages in order to increase their wealth; with the help of these vipras they build up networks of adulteration, black marketeering and smuggling.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..236"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=236 type=paragraph -->After the vaeshyas secure the allegiance of the vipras, they enlist them to help them consolidate the capitalistic social structure and philosophy. The contemporary Bhu&#x301;da&#x301;n movement<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.4.fn19"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#4.fn19">19</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> is an example of this type of philosophy; it is supported by the vaeshyas and propagated by the vipras under their control. As a result of this kind of movement, efforts to fight the exploitation of the vaeshyas decline because people think, "Why fight against rich people when they voluntarily distribute their land and wealth to the poor?" This aversion to fighting will somewhat lengthen the Vaeshya Age; because as the vaeshyas know full well, most of their donations are not genuine, but exist on paper only &ndash; and whenever they make genuine donations, they realize double the amount as profits in some other way.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..237"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=237 type=paragraph -->In the Vaeshya Age this type of rotten philosophy gets widely trumpeted in the newspapers. Attempts are also made to mislead students by including such harmful philosophies in textbooks. The agents of the vaeshyas attempt to awaken respect and devotion for vaeshyas in children&#146;s minds by depicting them in textbooks as symbols of peace, love and humanity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..238"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=238 type=paragraph -->To accomplish this objective a new type of nationalism based on economics is created which is totally different from both the nationalism of the Ks&#x301;atriya Age, based on personal force and family glory, and that of the Vipra Age, based on learning. The nationalism of the Vaeshya Age leads to a form of imperialism which is extremely dangerous for the unity of the human race.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..239"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=239 type=paragraph -->Although the vipras grovelling at the feet of the vaeshyas wield great authority at various levels of society as the servants of capitalistic imperialism, the vaeshyas never entrust them with the responsibility of leading society or structuring the economy. Only in this way can one easily understand whether a country or state is in the Vaeshya Age. It is not always the case that a state controlled by the vaeshyas is democratic. One indication that is clear is that the vaeshyas always keep the collection and distribution of finance and the corresponding ministerial posts in the hands of orthodox vaeshyas. They never delegate these responsibilities to a learned and experienced vipra economist, because it is their own systems of collection and distribution of finance that provide them the opportunity to establish themselves. Thus in the vaeshya social system, vipra scholars are nothing but paid planners and intellectual servants appointed to materialize those plans.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..240"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=240 type=paragraph -->Whenever, after popular acceptance of the vaeshya-created social system, it became apparent that vipras were trying to free themselves from the rule and exploitation of the vaeshyas, the vaeshyas would buy the support of the masses, rub the noses of the rebellious vipras in the dirt, and then replace them with a group of sycophantic vipras.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..241"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=241 type=paragraph -->The vaeshyas have repressed unrest and discontent among agricultural and industrial labourers, as well as political revolution, with the help not only of their vipra hirelings, but of ks&#x301;atriyas and shu&#x301;dras as well. In fact, of all the classes, the vaeshyas have made the most extensive use of the policy of divide and rule. For example, when a group of vipras vociferously demanded an investigation into the mysterious death of Shyamaprasad Mukherjee, another group of vipras immediately diverted their steam by increasing the tram fares in Calcutta and at the same time starting a movement to oppose the increase. Because of this, those typical vaeshyas who were directly or indirectly responsible for Shyamaprasad&#146;s death escaped punishment.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.4.fn20"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#4.fn20">20</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..242"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=242 type=paragraph -->The discriminatory measures adopted by employers or states ruled by vaeshyas to suppress labour agitations are generally known to every educated person. To disrupt the plans and intellectual movements of one group of vipras, a second group of vipras are appointed as spies or informers. Such spies or informers do not work out of ideological inspiration but in order to fill their stomachs. They are merely  paid servants of the vaeshyas.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..243"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=243 type=paragraph -->The efforts of intelligent vipras or brave ks&#x301;atriyas to escape from the influence of the vaeshyas can be called the vikra&#x301;nti [counter-evolution] or the prativiplava [counter-revolution] of the vipras or ks&#x301;atriyas.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..244"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=244 type=paragraph -->Some people consider what happened recently in Hungary as counter-revolution, but actually it was not.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.4.fn21"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#4.fn21">21</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  It was a vipra revolution against ks&#x301;atriya rule. It failed because factors relating to time, place and person could not be prepared properly. Those in power called it counter-revolution in order to belittle it.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..245"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=245 type=paragraph -->In India at present the Vaeshya Age is in full swing. But because there is not sufficient consciousness among the exploited vipras, ks&#x301;atriyas and shu&#x301;dras &ndash; and because the clever vaeshyas of India, having learned from the experiences of other countries and having become cautious, often employ some psychology and exploit people indirectly rather than directly &ndash; the revolution to end the Vaeshya Age has not yet taken place.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..246"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=246 type=paragraph -->What to speak of revolution, even the need for revolution has not yet been felt properly among intellectuals. At present they are in a hesitant frame of mind. They are waiting for the auspicious day when the Vaeshya Age will end naturally through kra&#x301;nti [evolution], without any struggle.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..247"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=247 type=paragraph -->This mentality is reflected in the support which a group of intellectuals extend to the Sarvodaya movement<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.4.fn22"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#4.fn22">22</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> and Gandhism. They deliberately ignore the fact that the Sarvodaya movement and Gandhism will only increase the period of their suffering.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..248"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=248 type=paragraph -->There is also a group of leaders who have genuine sympathy for the masses and who do not in their hearts support the Sarvodaya movement or Gandhism; they nevertheless believe that the vaeshyas will be removed from power without a struggle through their plans for a welfare state. I am not suggesting that their ideas are totally irrational, because they do have an example before them. Great Britain is moving towards socialism by accepting the ideals of a welfare state. If it is possible there, why shouldn&#146;t it be possible here? It is natural to ask this question, because in the rotation of the social cycle it is not imperative for revolution to occur. A change from one age to another can also occur through evolution. However, although it is theoretically possible to establish a welfare state or genuine economic freedom through evolution, in practice it will not work. It is true that in Great Britain some of the minimum requirements of life are being provided to the people, but how great the difference is between rich and poor! Clearly their social system is capitalistic. The exploited and disgruntled people are given a small amount of sympathy to appease them. They are given a small taste of the dainties and delicacies, but their stomachs are never full.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..249"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=249 type=paragraph -->The masses in India face greater privations than the masses in Britain. Due to a lack of political and economic consciousness and the confusion created by the misleading propaganda of the Sarvodaya movement and Gandhism, the people of India may continue to be complacent for some time more, misguided by the false promises of the agents of capitalism. However, this situation will not continue for long.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..250"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=250 type=paragraph -->Because rich people have the opportunity to purchase votes, it is not easy for leaders who are genuinely concerned about the people to become members of parliament. It is therefore not possible to eradicate the sufferings of the people of India by enacting laws befitting a genuine welfare state. It is not possible to bring about the economic liberation of India through the present democratic structure.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="4..252"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=252 type=paragraph -->The predominance of dishonest people over honest is far greater in the Vaeshya Age even than it was in the Vipra Age. The vaeshyas use most of their capital and privileged status to deprive others of the wealth they earn through their hard labour. (Here "labour" certainly includes intellectual labour.) Just as the vipras use their intellects to stupefy and manipulate the ks&#x301;atriyas&#146; vitality, the vaeshyas still more ruthlessly turn the vipras, as well as everybody else, into beasts of burden. When the Vaeshya Age begins after the Vipra Age, and the vipras and ks&#x301;atriyas helplessly sell themselves to the vaeshyas, the vipras and ks&#x301;atriyas clearly understand that they are sold. They are like chickens that have just been sold to the hungry chicken-fancier.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..253"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=253 type=paragraph -->Only the shu&#x301;dras fail to realize that they are sold. Although the vipras and ks&#x301;atriyas know what is happening, they nevertheless accept the dominance of the vaeshyas due to selfishness, infighting and a lack of economic knowledge. The vaeshyas are fully aware of the disunity and other weaknesses of the vipras and ks&#x301;atriyas, and they use this knowledge to perpetuate their hold on power; they use their financial power to incite one group against another. The ks&#x301;atriyas, out of obligation to the vaeshyas, lose their lives in needless battles and fracases of different kinds; while the vipras, similarly fed and sheltered by the vaeshyas, keep such factional conflicts permanently alive by creating various types of sentiment such as casteism, communalism, provincialism and nationalism, and by composing the necessary scriptures to accomplish this.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..254"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=254 type=paragraph -->It should be clearly understood that the vaeshyas encourage all isms that divide people. Casteism, communalism, provincialism and nationalism are supported mainly by the money of the vaeshyas. They finance such isms to keep people divided so that they cannot unite and protest against their exploitation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..255"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=255 type=paragraph -->The funny thing is that the vaeshyas purchase the vital energy of the ks&#x301;atriyas and the intellectual skills of the vipras with money and use that energy and those skills to perpetuate their hold on power and turn the ks&#x301;atriyas and vipras into long-term slaves. The vaeshyas&#146; financial power carries more weight than the power of speech and intellectual power of the vipras, not to mention the physical power of the ks&#x301;atriyas; therefore the vaeshyas have no trouble buying the vipras&#146; brains and the ks&#x301;atriyas&#146; brawn with their money.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..256"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=256 type=paragraph -->Among those who possess knowledge, intellect, great courage or physical strength, there is hardly anyone who has the courage, or sometimes even the intelligence, needed to take the financial risks necessary to earn money. The vaeshyas understand this weakness of the vipras and the ks&#x301;atriyas. They lull their discrimination to sleep by praising the ks&#x301;atriyas&#146; valour and the vipras&#146; intellect. Then afterwards they can easily buy them off. In a vaeshya state, poets, scientists, [[authors]] and great heroes are awarded prizes, medals and titles for this very reason. By participating in all this, the vipras and the ks&#x301;atriyas surrender all their endowments at the feet of the vaeshyas for a little money or some name and fame; and at the same time feel they are fortunate. They fail to realize that they are digging their own graves.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="5..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Both the ks&#x301;atriyas and the vipras like to enjoy material wealth, though their methods of accumulating material objects are different. The vaeshyas, however, are more interested in possessing material objects than enjoying them. Looking at their possessions, or thinking about them, gives them a certain peace of mind. So in the Vaeshya Age the practical value of material goods is less than at any other time. They gradually become inert both literally and in financial terms. This is the greatest curse of the Vaeshya Age, because the less the mobility of material goods, that is, the greater their stagnation in different spheres, the more harmful it is for the common people. In the Ks&#x301;atriya and Vipra Ages it is very rare for people to die of starvation while grains rot in the warehouses. Although there is disparity of wealth in the Ks&#x301;atriya and Vipra Ages, ks&#x301;atriyas and vipras do not kick others into a pit of privation, poverty and starvation while they themselves enjoy their wealth. This is because they see other people as tools to be used for the purpose of exploitation, but do not see them as the wellspring of exploitation as the vaeshyas do. To a vaeshya, the shu&#x301;dras, ks&#x301;atriyas and vipras are not only tools to be used for exploitative purposes, they are the wellspring of exploitation as well.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The vaeshyas gain material objects of enjoyment through the physical efforts of others; or directly through mental efforts; or sometimes through such physical efforts, sometimes through mental efforts, and sometimes through both simultaneously, according to the situation. So in this respect the vaeshyas are similar to the vipras. However, the difference is that when the vipras acquire objects of enjoyment, they do not let others know that that is their intention; they resort to various types of logic, quote from the scriptures, fake indifference, and employ many other techniques. The vaeshyas do not do such things. In this regard at least, they are more straightforward than the vipras. They do not hide their intentions, which are to accumulate an increasing number of objects of enjoyment.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->As vipras are to some extent guided by conscience, they do not utilize their intellects solely to accumulate objects of enjoyment. If they develop a greater degree of conscience or if their intellects increase, they will often neglect to do this altogether. But this never happens with vaeshyas, first of all because they are somewhat lacking in conscience. And secondly, if any of them do have a bit more conscience, they will satisfy it by making donations according to their convenience, priorities or inclination, but they will never stop accumulating objects of enjoyment. A vaeshya with a conscience may donate a hundred thousand rupees at a moment&#146;s notice, but while buying and selling he will not easily let go of even a paisa.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The consequences of accumulating material objects of enjoyment are not the same for vaeshyas as they are for vipras, either. Because they generally spend some time thinking about higher pursuits, vipras do not ideate on objects of enjoyment. But vaeshyas do. As a result they one day take the form of matter.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..5"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Vaeshya Mentality<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Whatever glory the vaeshyas gain, they gain at the risk of their lives. In this regard they are definitely greater than the vipras and may also be greater than the ks&#x301;atriyas. The vaeshyas always keep in mind the possible ups and downs in life and their personal profit and loss; thus they develop the capacity to adapt to a wide variety of situations. They are neither especially attracted to luxuries nor repelled by hardships. This is the key to their success.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Vaeshyas are fighters, but their methods of fighting are different from those of the ks&#x301;atriyas or even the vipras. Actually they lack the powerful personalities of the ks&#x301;atriyas and are in fact the opposite &ndash; weak personalities. They do not hesitate to sell their personal force, their society, their nation, the prestige of women, or national welfare, which the ks&#x301;atriyas would never do. Vipras limit their fighting to the intellectual sphere, but this is not exactly the case with vaeshyas. Although they also fight intellectually, they do so only to make money. If a vipra and a vaeshya ever engage in a purely intellectual fight, the vipra will win. But if the fight is between their urges for financial gain, the vaeshya will win; the vaeshyas will lock the vipras&#146; minds up in their iron safes.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Vaeshyas perceive the world through greedy eyes. They do not have the capacity to correctly or fully understand worldly issues. They do not understand anything except the economic value of things. Their commercial outlook is not confined to the material world only; it also includes the psychic and spiritual worlds.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Even though vaeshyas, as a kind of intellectual, have the capacity to acquire psychic wealth, they do not utilize this capacity properly. However, some vaeshyas do find quite subtle ways to make money &ndash; it all depends on the degree of their intellect.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.5.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#5.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> Though they may have a developed intellect or a desire to do good, they never forget that their primary aim is to make money. They worship whichever god makes them rich. After earning tens of millions of rupees by cheating people with their business acumen, they use a small part of their profit to construct temples or dharmasha&#x301;las [pilgrims&#146; inns], because they believe that this will absolve them of their sins.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Vaeshyas do not like to tread the path of desireless action in order to make their minds one-pointed and realize God. They avoid or usually try to avoid the real purpose of dharma, for they do not have any sense of or feeling for religion other than some degree of fear of God. If this fear decreases, they begin to behave like mean-minded demons. In such a state of mind they can commit any type of sin to satisfy their hunger for money.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->A mind which runs after money moves in very crooked ways. Although this movement involves intense effort, due to the crudeness of its objective the movement cannot be straightforward: it is crooked, extremely crooked.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Due to their intense effort vaeshyas are mutative by nature, and due to the crudeness of their objectives they are static by nature; thus they are a combination of the mutative [red] and static [black] forces and are symbolized by the colour yellow.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Though vaeshyas make greater efforts than do ks&#x301;atriyas, their efforts are more psychic than physical.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..14"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Deadly Social Parasites<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Vaeshyas believe that only a few people can accumulate material wealth, depriving the rest. Thus there will always be only a few vaeshyas, while those who are the objects and tools of their exploitation form the majority. Like exploited beasts of burden which carry bags of sugar, in their crippled state of mind the majority feel that they do not have the right to taste the sweetness. This feeling is the greatest ally of the vaeshyas, so directly or indirectly they always try to nurture this type of feeling in the minds of the majority. Consequently they propagate various types of isms and ethereal theories with the help of the vipras in their pay whom they have reduced to the level of shu&#x301;dras. When the majority, unable to tolerate this exploitation any longer or find any other way out, desperately leap into action, the Vaeshya Age comes to an end. But it takes a long time for downtrodden people to understand that the vaeshyas are the parasites of society. Hence thorough preparation is required to end the Vaeshya Age.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->By vaeshyas I mean here the low type of vaeshyas. However, I am not prepared to call those who are not low vaeshyas, &ldquo;high&rdquo; vaeshyas; because while it is true that they give donations as well as exploit, and that society may be benefited by their donations, that will not bring the people who have died from their exploitation back to life!<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->The vaeshyas increase their wealth by buying the back-breaking labour of the shu&#x301;dras, the powerful personalities of the ks&#x301;atriyas, and the intellect of the vipras, according to their needs. The shu&#x301;dras, just like beasts, sell their physical labour in exchange for mere subsistence. Because they sell their labour, society survives and moves ahead. The powerful personalities of the ks&#x301;atriyas build and maintain the social structure with the labour extracted from the shu&#x301;dras. Through their intellect the vipras utilize the personal force of the ks&#x301;atriyas, and through their money and capitalistic mentality the vaeshyas utilize the vipras&#146; intellect to increase their wealth.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->The vaeshyas do not confront any social problem directly. Just as they buy the labour of the shu&#x301;dras, the personal force of the ks&#x301;atriyas and the intellect of the vipras with money, so they endeavour to solve all social problems with money. They do not win victory on the battlefield; they buy it with money. In poverty-stricken democratic countries they buy votes. As they accomplish everything with money, their vital force comes from money. They therefore take all sorts of risks in life to accumulate money. For money they can sacrifice their conscience, their sense of good and bad, right and wrong, at any moment. So in order to save the exploited shu&#x301;dras, ks&#x301;atriyas and vipras from the vaeshyas, money, which is the source of all their power, has to be taken out of their hands.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->Of course it is not wise to think that all social problems will be solved just by taking money away from the vaeshyas. Although they will have lost their money, they will still have their greedy, money-making mentality.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Thus the structure of society will have to be built in such a way, and society will have to progress in such a way (maintaining balance among time, place and person), that the greedy, money-making mentality of the vaeshyas is rendered ineffectual. This cannot be accomplished by persuasion or by delivering philosophical talks. Their money-making intellect will have to be rendered ineffectual through physical force, and they will have to be shown the divine truth and made to sit and perform spiritual practices to awaken their pinnacled intellect.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->To the vaeshyas the social body is merely a machine for making money. The vipras are the head, the ks&#x301;atriyas are the arms, and the shu&#x301;dras are the legs of the machine. The authors of scripture may say that the vaeshyas are the thighs of the machine, but I would say that this is incorrect. Of course the vaeshyas are part of the social body, but they are not part of the money-making machine within that social body. They are separate. They supply the oil, water and fuel to the machine, but they take far more from the machine than they spend on it. They think, &ldquo;As I supply oil, water and fuel to the machine to keep it running, all of the output is mine. My money built the machine, and with my money I can destroy it. If necessary I will get more work out of it by supplying it with more oil, water and fuel, and if I no longer need it I will send it to the junkyard.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->If, in the history of human struggle, the role of the vipras is one of parasitic dependence on others, I cannot find words to describe the role of the vaeshyas. Both the vipras and the vaeshyas exploit society, but the vipra exploiters are not as terrible as the vaeshya exploiters. The vaeshyas are like a deadly parasite on the tree of society which tries to kill the tree by sucking dry all its vital sap. But if the tree dies, the parasite will also die. The vaeshya parasites understand this and therefore try to ensure the survival of society by making some donations; they build temples, mosques, churches and pilgrims&#146; inns, give little bonuses, feed the poor; etc. Calamity only comes when they lose their common sense out of excessive greed and try to suck society completely dry.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Once the social body falls unconscious, the vaeshyas will die along with the rest of the body. Otherwise, before allowing themselves to die, the exploited shu&#x301;dras, ks&#x301;atriyas and vipras can unite to destroy the vaeshyas. This is the rule.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..24"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->Crooked Intellect<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->The path of the vipras is crooked and so is the path of the vaeshyas. The difference between them is that since the vaeshyas&#146; crooked intellect has no trace of spiritual consciousness, it often proves to be suicidal.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->A dreadful calamity will befall society if those who have intellectual capacity squander it by running after mundane pleasures instead of utilizing it to realize spiritual bliss &ndash; if they utilize all their intellect to fatten themselves by sucking the vital juice of others. So there can be no social welfare until this type of mentality is eradicated or rendered ineffectual through circumstantial pressure. No political leader or governmental or social system can build a welfare state, a socialistic state or an ideal society if they neglect this fundamental disease. If those who go around looking for opportunities to enlarge their stomachs by sucking the vital force of others continue to control society or the nation through their own group of sinners, what can one expect to see in such a society except a horrid picture of hell!<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->Most of the evils that occur in society are created due to the exploitation carried out by the vaeshyas. In order to increase the size of their bank balances, the vaeshyas create an artificial scarcity of such items as food, clothing and other essential commodities, and then earn a profit by black marketeering. Those who do not have the capacity to purchase commodities at exorbitant prices steal, commit armed robberies and engage in other criminal activities in order to obtain the minimum requirements of their lives. Poor people deprived of food and clothing work as the agents of the greedy vaeshyas engaged in black marketeering and smuggling. When these poor people are caught, they are the ones who get punished, while the vaeshyas escape thanks to the power of their money. Such ill-fated poor people lose their consciences and descend deeper into sin. Society condemns these sinners, while the rich vaeshyas, the instigators of the sinners, play the role of public leaders. They wear garlands, set off verbal fireworks, and shrilly exhort the masses to make greater sacrifices.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..28"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->Prostitution<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->The repugnant social disease of prostitution is also a creation of the vaeshyas. As a result of excessive wealth the vaeshyas lose their self-control and their character on the one hand; and many unfortunate women are forced by poverty to descend to this sinful occupation on the other hand.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->In India prostitution has been outlawed, but every rational person knows that it cannot be stopped by legal means. Poor women who once lived in red-light districts have only fled out of fear of the law to respectable localities. As a result the sin which was previously confined to certain areas is now spreading to other parts of town. In order to eradicate this sinful occupation in India, it will be necessary to eliminate the vaeshya social system, because in eighty per cent of cases the cause of prostitution is economic injustice. Of course if due to wrong education or base propensities people (both men and women) give indulgence to this sinful occupation, it will continue even after the eradication of economic injustices. So instead of enacting laws, the exploitation of the vaeshyas will have to be eliminated, as will other social injustices. And instead of legally banning something, a healthy outlook should be encouraged.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->Of course it is in the nature of a vaeshya-dominated social system that many good laws are framed just to win cheap applause from the public. However, none of these laws are strictly implemented; because if they were, it would become difficult to exploit people.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..32"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->The Acquisition of Wealth<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->Neither the vipras nor the vaeshyas directly produce the wealth of society; instead they accumulate the wealth produced by others. To say that there is a heaven-and-hell difference between their methods of acquiring wealth is to say little. The vipras use their intellect and acquire the hard-earned wealth of others in order to meet their material needs, maintain their reputation in society and protect their prestige. But the vaeshya outlook is different. They are content to simply accumulate wealth, and derive pleasure from thinking about their accumulated riches. Hence even millionaire vaeshyas sometimes neglect the bare necessities of life. They forget their hunger when they are counting their money; they forget their personal needs &ndash; their minds get absorbed &ndash; when they see the wealth they have accumulated. And as for prestige, they sell it for money without any hesitation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->If a certain commodity is easily obtainable in the open market, a vaeshya will welcome a customer with folded hands, saying, &ldquo;Please come in, sir, have some betel.&rdquo; But when the same commodity is only available in the black market, the same vaeshya will not even recognize that customer.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.5.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#5.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> In other words, to vaeshyas money is the only thing that matters. Where money is concerned, their own prestige or the prestige of others is of no consequence.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->When people use their intellects over a long period of time solely to accumulate material wealth, their intellects, because they have inculcated this sort of thought in their mental bodies, gradually develop in that direction. In other words, &ldquo;How can I accumulate more?&rdquo; ultimately becomes their only thought. Their social spirit and sense of humanity gradually disappear until eventually they become total blood-sucking leeches. They do not retain even the tiniest scrap of humanity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..36"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph -->At the beginning of the Vaeshya Age some social spirit still exists in them alongside the desire to make money. Whatever their motive may be, the vaeshyas do sometimes spend generously on social service and charitable activities, but by the end of the Vaeshya Age they lose even the last vestiges of social consciousness, and as a result of their foolhardiness shu&#x301;dra revolution occurs.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..37"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=37 type=paragraph -->At the beginning of the Vaeshya Age the vaeshyas use their money-making intellect both for social service and for accumulating money, and in these matters they take advice from other members of society. But by the end of the Vaeshya Age they become so irresponsible due to the intoxication of accumulation that they are not prepared to take advice from anyone. They use their money-making intellect solely to exploit society.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..38"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=38 type=paragraph -->How the Vaeshyas Evolve<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..39"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=39 type=paragraph -->In the Vipra Age those who were defeated due to their lack of physical strength, courage or intellectual ability tried to discover an alternative way to live and gain social recognition. The particular type of psychic clash which arose in their minds due to their constant efforts to establish themselves developed in them their money-making intellect. This skill helped them to utilize the strength of the strong, the courage of the brave and the intellect of the intellectuals, and the more they were able to do this the more they became known as shres&#x301;t&#x301;hiis.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..40"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=40 type=paragraph -->Here the funny thing is that the vaeshyas, who had money but no social status, were able to obtain from the vipras whom they exploited titles of respect such as shres&#x301;t&#x301;hii<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.5.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#5.fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> and sa&#x301;dhu [honest]. (Sa&#x301;dhu became sa&#x301;hu and today it is Sa&#x301;u [a common surname].) The vipras took on the worry-free job of priests to these shres&#x301;t&#x301;hiis and sa&#x301;dhus. They underwent austerities, performed worship and recited scripture on behalf of the shres&#x301;t&#x301;hiis in return for money. The courageous ks&#x301;atriyas took upon themselves the responsibility of being armed gatekeepers, and began to salute the shres&#x301;t&#x301;hiis twice a day. Other vipras became clerks, accountants, etc.; and the shu&#x301;dras became porters and labourers. Through their work they all gradually began to elevate the status of the shres&#x301;t&#x301;hiis. This is an objective picture of the Vaeshya Age in every country of the world.<!-- /block --></p>

Such people become pseudo-vaeshyas, and towards the end of the Vaeshya Age their dominance of society becomes evident. The vipras&#146; crooked thinking blends with the vaeshya-like economic intellect of these pseudo-vaeshyas, but the pseudo-vaeshyas do not possess any of the good qualities of either the vaeshyas or the vipras. So although they carry on the vaeshya legacy up to the very end of the Vaeshya Age, they finally fall into utter disgrace and disrepute.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.5.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#5.fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..43"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=43 type=paragraph -->In their efforts to perpetuate their exploitation without hindrance, the pseudo-vaeshyas make use not only of their economic intellect but also of whatever other intellectual capacities they possess. By hook or by crook they even seize governmental power. They then use that power as an instrument of exploitation, a cruel machine to ruthlessly pulverize the whole of society. Out of fear that their descendants may face financial difficulties in the future due to their lack of competence, they not only continue to exploit the whole of society, but also set aside for those descendants huge sums of money which remain wholly or partially unutilized.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..44"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=44 type=paragraph -->The non-utilization of capital is the worst consequence of economic exploitation. Exploited and downtrodden people who do not want to be exploited to death, revolt. Thus shu&#x301;dra revolution occurs during the period of the Vaeshya Age which is dominated by dishonest vaeshyas.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..45"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=45 type=paragraph -->The vitality of the Ks&#x301;atriya Age gives way to the intellectuality of the Vipra Age, and the intellectuality of the vipras is bought for money in the Vaeshya Age. The vaeshyas buy the vipras&#146; intellect with money, and with the help of that intellect they build up their state, society and economic structure, putting them to work as they choose.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..46"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=46 type=paragraph -->Generating Collective Wealth<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..47"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=47 type=paragraph -->Nothing in the world is exclusively good or exclusively bad. Is the Vaeshya Age only an age of economic exploitation? Is there nothing good in this present Vaeshya Age, and has there never been anything good in it? Although it is a fact that the vaeshyas&#146; economic exploitation has always surpassed their service, they have nevertheless done service, however small or insignificant it may have been. When the vipras collect something (directly or indirectly), they decide how and to what extent it can be put to use, how it can be enjoyed by the people and how it can be utilized for their welfare. But the vaeshyas collect things without thinking about how they can be utilized for social welfare. Instead they think about how to compel people through circumstantial pressure to buy those things so that they can earn money in exchange.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..48"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=48 type=paragraph -->Material goods have no practical value for the vaeshyas, except as a source of income. This type of mentality leads them to illegally hoard foodstuffs out of a greedy desire for greater profits, depriving millions of people of food and pushing them down the road towards death.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..49"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=49 type=paragraph -->We do not expect vipras to do such things. The vipras do promote their personal interests and their domination, but they do not try to deprive the shu&#x301;dras and ks&#x301;atriyas of a chance to live. But if the vaeshyas think of the ks&#x301;atriyas or shu&#x301;dras as thorns on the path of making money, they will deprive them of a chance, and often out of greed for greater profit indirectly kill them.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..50"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=50 type=paragraph -->Having said all this, I still contend that nothing in this world is exclusively good or bad. For any individual or collective endeavour, capital, either in the form of money or resources, is initially required. The opportunity to create such capital, to create capital in a massive way or in a widely-diversified way, comes in the Vaeshya Age. With the help of such capital, wealth can be generated for both individual and collective needs, and this is what happens.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..51"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=51 type=paragraph -->In order to raise the general standard of living in a society, state or economy, capital is required, whether the capital comes from within a particular country or from outside. No matter where it comes from, it must be controlled partly or completely by an individual. The individual controller is, of course, the vaeshya. But if, without examining how it should or should not be used, the use or control of the capital is entrusted to a government, a cooperative or a representative of the public, non-utilization or misutilization of the capital will be inevitable in all circumstances. This is one of the main reasons why capitalistic countries develop extremely rapidly in the material sphere.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..52"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=52 type=paragraph -->Furthermore, if large amounts of capital are placed under collective management, a small error on the part of the managers will lead to gross misutilization. This is the main reason why the system of collective farming, or the commune system, has failed in socialistic countries. If the ownership of wealth is taken away from individuals and placed in the hands of the state &ndash; in other words, if the vaeshya system is abolished by force &ndash; managers will not have the same control over that wealth as individual owners would.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..53"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=53 type=paragraph -->State Capitalism<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..54"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=54 type=paragraph -->One thing more needs to be said about collective capital: collective capital does not always mean the establishment of socialism. Where collective capital means the capital of the state, if the state tries to increase its national wealth without stopping exploitation in society and without trying to increase individual wealth, increasing the national wealth will mean increasing the individual wealth of only a few people in power. Thus, although there is an increase in the per capita income, the per capita income of the poor does not increase, and the per capita income of the well-to-do does not decrease.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..55"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=55 type=paragraph -->Although one cannot support this sort of state capitalism, one cannot deny that the state has to utilize capital in order to increase the wealth of the state. If state capitalism actually increases the per capita income of every person without constantly seeking to exploit, we cannot but praise it &ndash; it can be considered exemplary socialism. After all, a state must invest capital if it wants to increase the national income. Such capital investment is clearly a vaeshya system.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..56"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=56 type=paragraph -->Perpetuating Exploitation<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..57"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=57 type=paragraph -->The vaeshyas became established through their materialistic intellect. First they defeated the vipras through their materialistic intellect and financial machinations, then they turned them into sycophants so that they could harness their intellects in order to increase their wealth.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..58"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=58 type=paragraph -->Although the production, accumulation and distribution of things indispensable for the preservation of human life are carried out under the ownership or partial supervision of the vaeshyas, those whose labour, personal force and intellect are actually used to produce and distribute essential commodities are not vaeshyas. In order to meet their own needs those people mortgage their labour, personal force and intellect to the vaeshyas. The vaeshyas clearly understand that their system of exploitation will fail without the help of the shu&#x301;dras, ks&#x301;atriyas and vipras.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..59"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=59 type=paragraph -->Thus behind their grandiloquence the vaeshyas continue their psychological manipulations in order to perpetuate their capitalistic rule. Through this process the shu&#x301;dras and ks&#x301;atriyas readily become their slaves. Although the vipras understand what is happening, after a short struggle they are also compelled to surrender to the vaeshyas like a fly caught in a spider&#146;s web.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..60"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=60 type=paragraph -->These psychological manipulations, a part of vaeshya philosophy, begin to fail only when the shu&#x301;dras, ks&#x301;atriyas and vipras lose their minds due to excessive exploitation. They then become desperate, blind, mindless people who completely lack conscience, intellect or rationality. One day they mercilessly smash the vaeshya structure to pieces. How or why they did it, or how the new structure will be built &ndash; these considerations, this type of thinking &ndash; never enter their minds. They only jump into the struggle in order to survive. They think, &ldquo;Since there is no point in living, let us die sooner.&rdquo; While this directionless revolution is going on, the condition of the shu&#x301;dras, ks&#x301;atriyas and vipras becomes almost the same. It is useless to expect from them anything worthy of human beings.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..61"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=61 type=paragraph -->Intellect controls strength; therefore the vipras control the shu&#x301;dras and the ks&#x301;atriyas. But, Annacinta&#x301; camatka&#x301;ra&#x301; [&ldquo;Wonderful are the ways of hunger&rdquo;] &ndash; when even intelligent people find themselves struggling to survive, they readily sell their intelligence for money; for this reason the vipras sell themselves to the vaeshyas. They not only sell themselves, but also surrender the shu&#x301;dras and the ks&#x301;atriyas, whom they had previously controlled, at the holy feet of their vaeshya overlords. Without the help of the vipras, it would be virtually impossible for the vaeshyas to force the shu&#x301;dras and the ks&#x301;atriyas to work.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..62"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=62 type=paragraph -->It is therefore evident that in a capitalistic structure, when the vaeshyas struggle to perpetuate their system of exploitation, they do not physically struggle, they merely spend money. Upon taking the money, the vipras then fight with their nerves, the ks&#x301;atriyas with their muscles, and the shu&#x301;dras with their sweat and labour.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..63"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=63 type=paragraph -->Thus it is clear that in any type of communal or other reactionary-instigated conflict, there are wealthy bosses on both sides behind the riots and fracases. The bosses themselves never take up spears, lances or axes and fight.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..64"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=64 type=paragraph -->The victory of wealth over intellect, the vipras&#146; surrender at the feet of the vaeshyas, does not come about in a single day. As mentioned earlier, the vipras get caught like a fly in a spider&#146;s web; they do make some efforts to understand their situation, but finally they become so entangled in the web that their vitality gets exhausted in the struggle and they have no alternative but to surrender. They are then compelled to sing the victory songs of the vaeshyas as they beat their heads in despair.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..65"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=65 type=paragraph -->Through the power of money the vaeshyas take over all the constructive work accomplished by, or useful things built by, the intelligence and ideological commitment of the vipras, the sacrifice and personal force of innumerable ks&#x301;atriyas, and the labour of countless shu&#x301;dras. Sometimes the vipras, ks&#x301;atriyas and shu&#x301;dras seek the help of the unworthy vaeshyas in order to preserve some worthy institution. But for the sake of money, they are compelled to name the institution after those vaeshyas.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..66"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=66 type=paragraph -->However, the vaeshyas&#146; cunning methods of economic exploitation do encounter set-backs according to time, place and person. Whenever they see the vipras, ks&#x301;atriyas and shu&#x301;dras moving towards counter-evolution or counter-revolution, they adopt new forms of deception in order to save their position. Until an actual shu&#x301;dra revolution occurs, they engage themselves untiringly in trying to discover newer and more artful methods of deception.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..67"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=67 type=paragraph -->It should be remembered that in countries where the dominant vaeshya structure is at present extremely firm and stable, the strength of that structure was not created in a day. The vaeshyas laboured a long time to build it and they will try to maintain it by any means. To expect, under such circumstances, that they will be won over by humble requests, or will voluntarily put on a loincloth and renounce the world, is sheer lunacy. Actually such things are possible if they become inspired by a great spiritual ideology; however, this would require the long-term, continuous propagation of morality-based spirituality among the vaeshyas. Intelligent people should certainly consider whether it is really rational to allow the exploitation of the masses to go on until such a day comes.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..68"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=68 type=paragraph -->The occasional charity works that the vaeshyas undertake are only a trick to maintain their exploitation. Most of their charitable activities are not inspired by humanism; their sole purpose is to keep the machinery of exploitation, that is, the vipras and the shu&#x301;dras, functioning. If the vipras and the shu&#x301;dras die, who will there be to exploit? The cunning vaeshyas consider such charitable activities as investments.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..69"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=69 type=paragraph -->The help that vaeshyas extend to poor people in difficult times, during floods and famines, they afterwards recover with interest. They are benefited in various ways. First, their businesses continue to run and they make good money. Secondly, people who are disgruntled with the vaeshyas&#146; exploitation are to some extent pacified and their wounded minds are temporarily soothed.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..70"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=70 type=paragraph -->Of course these comments do not apply to those vaeshyas who do social service out of humanitarian or spiritual inspiration. No doubt there are some honest vaeshyas who are worthy of veneration by everyone.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..71"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=71 type=paragraph -->Whatever dignity a person possesses as a human being in either the Ks&#x301;atriya Age or the Vipra Age is dealt its heaviest blow in the Vaeshya Age. In the Vaeshya Age a person&#146;s dignity is measured in terms of money. The repercussions of this defective evaluation of human beings are not confined only to the realm of dignity; they have far-reaching effects in all spheres of society.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..72"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=72 type=paragraph -->No matter how many other qualities they may possess, vipras and ks&#x301;atriyas who think independently, possess a sense of dignity or are self-reliant, cannot establish themselves unless they learn to flatter the vaeshyas in a psychological way. Even the unworthy son or relative of a wealthy person has the opportunity to sit at the head of society, and through the power of money an unattractive daughter is properly married to a good bridegroom. A good marriage cannot be arranged even for the sons of the poor, intelligent and educated though they may be, let alone the daughters of the poor. In fact in the Vaeshya Age people cannot hope to be respected unless they are rich. Those who hope for respect or have gained it, depend or have depended on the mercy of the vaeshyas.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="5..77"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=77 type=paragraph -->The difficulties faced by those who have tried and are trying to break apart the structure of the Vaeshya Age in order to rebuild society on a humanistic foundation, are not less, but are in fact a little more, than the indescribable social tortures that great people suffered in the past when they tried to reform the social structure of the Vipra Age. This is because those who wanted to break apart the vipras&#146; structure had to fight the vipras and also the ks&#x301;atriyas and shu&#x301;dras under their protection, but those who want to strike at the vaeshyas&#146; structure have to fight against all the vipras, ks&#x301;atriyas and shu&#x301;dras who are obedient to the vaeshyas.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..78"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=78 type=paragraph -->But there are similarities between the two. The common people misunderstand great people who act on their behalf and for their welfare, or even if they understand them, they do not give them their support.

<a name="5..79"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=79 type=paragraph -->The vipras exploit the masses in the Vipra Age under the pretence of religion, which cannot be challenged. The same thing occurs in the Vaeshya Age, but vaeshya exploitation is more dangerous. In the Vipra Age the vipras exploit others through religion in order to promote their personal interests, but in the Vaeshya Age the vipras exploit others through religion in order to promote both their own and the vaeshyas&#146; interests.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..80"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=80 type=paragraph -->In the Vaeshya Age this religious exploitation is more psychic than physical, because the vaeshyas use the vipras to try to spread intellectual propaganda among the masses to prevent them from finding any philosophical justification for their suppressed grievances against the vaeshya structure. This intellectual propaganda aims to convince people that they are the victims of circumstance. It argues, &ldquo;Everything is destiny. Everything is preordained.&rdquo; Such doctrines help the vaeshyas to perpetuate their structure. They destroy the personal force of people and make them the playthings of fate. People accept the idea that everything is preordained, and support the status quo.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..81"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=81 type=paragraph -->Those who try to break the structure of the Vaeshya Age and show the downtrodden the path of liberation, will have to advise the people to free themselves from the intoxicating effect of the opium of religion; otherwise how will they be able to serve the downtrodden people?<!-- /block --></p>

<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="5.fn1"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.5.fn1">1</a></b>)  In the winter of the Bengali year 1368 [end of 1961 or beginning of 1962 BCE], some opportunistic astrologers (vipras) declared that the world would soon come to an end following the conjunction of several planets in a particular house of the zodiac. Perhaps they thought that the public would be frightened by such a declaration, and just prior to the cataclysm might renounce everything and donate a large part of their wealth to the vipras in an effort to ensure that they would go to heaven. This plan of the Indian vipras met with some success; out of fear many sinners undertook charitable activities. <br> The frightened vaeshyas arranged sacrificial fires presided over by the astrologer-priests. They thought that perhaps the smoke from the sacrificial fires would change the course of the planets concerned, moving them out of the zodiacal house they were in and thereby preventing the destruction. The commercial mentality of the vaeshyas (capitalists) was glaringly evident in their temporary religious fervour. <br> Along with this there was another amusing thing I noticed. For use in the sacrificial fires the vaeshyas sold unsaleable ghee, which was unfit for human consumption, at exorbitant prices.</p>

When the vaeshyas, maddened with excessive greed, lose their common sense completely and forsake their humanity totally, then for shu&#x301;dra revolution the opportune time has come. However, it cannot be said that shu&#x301;dra revolution will automatically occur just because an opportune time has come. Proper conditions relating to place and person will bear much of the responsibility.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="6..4"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Obstacles to Revolution<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Those who want to bring about proletariat revolution with the help of manual labourers only will not succeed unless they take into consideration the mentality of the people involved. Shu&#x301;dra-minded people do not understand their own problems; they do not even have the courage to dream about solving them. No matter how well labour leaders explain the problems to them or how fiery their lectures on the need for struggle be, it will not have any influence over their minds. They will spend their time eating, drinking, and getting violently drunk. They cannot think about who in their families is eating properly or getting an education or not. If their bosses increase their wages, they will merely spend more on their addiction; their standard of living will not be raised. That is why I say that such people do not and cannot bring about a shu&#x301;dra revolution. It is not only undesirable but also foolish for those who want to bring about revolution to depend on such people; their static nature will thwart its movement, their cowardice will prematurely extinguish the fire of revolution.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Besides this type of mentality, national and religious traditions also often thwart revolution. It is extremely difficult for ks&#x301;atriya- and vipra-minded shu&#x301;dras to go against such traditions, let alone shu&#x301;dra-minded shu&#x301;dras. People become averse to revolution due to the following ideas: &ldquo;Whatever is fated will happen; does fighting accomplish anything?&rdquo;; &ldquo;Our days are somehow passing by, so why should we trouble ourselves?&rdquo;; or incorrect interpretations of the nis&#x301;ka&#x301;ma karmava&#x301;da [doctrine of desireless action] of the Giita&#x301; or other scriptures.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->In fact, a subtle analysis will reveal that the policy of establishing a welfare state on a democratic base is also an obstacle to revolution; as are the ideals of Gandhism and the high-sounding theory of democratic socialism.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->The Bhu&#x301;da&#x301;n movement is also a reactionary movement in this way. Although I have high regard for the founders of Gandhism and the Bhu&#x301;da&#x301;n movement &ndash; as men they are second to none &ndash; their philosophies are extremely harmful for poor people.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Some of the philosophical interpretations of janma&#x301;ntarava&#x301;da [the doctrine of transmigration of souls, or reincarnation] also oppose revolution; that is, they argue, &ldquo;You are starving in this life because you committed many sins in your last life, so what is the point of launching a movement? Destiny cannot be changed.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->That is why I have said that ks&#x301;atriya- and vipra-minded shu&#x301;dras will bring about the people&#146;s revolution. For this, these shu&#x301;dras will have to be thoroughly prepared, suffer a lot and make great sacrifices. They will have to fight against opposing groups and doctrines.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..11"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->The Pioneers of Revolution<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->It is very easy to talk big about revolution. Audiences may be awestruck and applaud, but to actually bring about a revolution is not at all easy.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Those ks&#x301;atriya- or vipra-minded shu&#x301;dras who are the pioneers of revolution will have to learn to be disciplined, take proper revolutionary training, build their character, be moralists; in a word, they will have to become what I call sadvipras. A sadvipra will not launch a movement against honest people, even if he or she does not like them. But a sadvipra will definitely take action against dishonest people, even if he or she likes them. In such matters it will not do to indulge any kind of mental weakness.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Such strict, ideological sadvipras will be the messengers of the revolution. They will carry the message of revolution to every home in the world, to every vein and capillary of human existence. The banner of victorious revolution will be carried by them alone.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Moralists and spiritualists can be found among all types of people, regardless of whether they are rich or poor. Everyone knows that the idea that rich means honest is completely false. But most sadvipras will come from the middle class. By &ldquo;middle class&rdquo; I mean the vipra- and ks&#x301;atriya-minded shu&#x301;dras.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->One may ask whether rich people who are moral and spiritual can be sadvipras or not. In reply I will say yes, they can be. But in order to be sadvipras they will have to come down to the level of the middle class, because they cannot live in indolent luxury on capital acquired by sinful means. In order to follow the principles of Prout,<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.6.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#6.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> they will have to fight against sin and injustice, and in order to conduct such a fight properly, they will not be able to keep their wealth &ndash; they will have to become middle-class.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->The meaning of the word sadvipra is &ldquo;a person who is a moralist and a spiritualist and who fights against immorality&rdquo;. Earning money in a sinful way or accumulating great wealth is against the fundamental principles of Prout. It will be quite impossible for people who are not following the fundamental principles of Prout to bring about shu&#x301;dra revolution.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->One may also ask whether poor people can be sadvipras. In reply I will say that yes, they can be. But only poor people who have the minds of ks&#x301;atriyas or vipras can bring about a revolution, and such poor people I call the middle class. That is how I explain the term madhyavitta sama&#x301;ja [&ldquo;middle class&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->I do not agree with those who are of the opinion that people who do not work physically but intellectually are middle-class. I do not agree either with those who believe that those whose income is neither high nor low are middle-class. If we were to accept this second interpretation of &ldquo;middle-class&rdquo;, I would have to point out that the income of many shu&#x301;dra-minded shu&#x301;dras who perform manual labour in society is higher than that of many ks&#x301;atriya- or vipra-minded shu&#x301;dras.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->If anybody objects to the use of the term &ldquo;middle class&rdquo;, or if anybody says that &ldquo;middle class&rdquo; refers to those who have an average amount of wealth and that therefore the pioneers of the revolution &ndash; the ks&#x301;atriya- or vipra-minded shu&#x301;dras &ndash; may or may not be middle-class, I am prepared to use the term viks&#x301;ubdha [disgruntled], instead of &ldquo;middle-class&rdquo;, to describe the revolutionary shu&#x301;dras. The viks&#x301;ubdha shu&#x301;dras are a constant source of uneasiness for the tyrannical vaeshyas. The capitalists are not afraid of labour unrest, but they are afraid of the labour leaders, the viks&#x301;ubdha shu&#x301;dras.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->The capitalists like democracy as a system of government  because in the democratic system they can easily purchase the shu&#x301;dra-minded shu&#x301;dras who constitute the majority. It is easy to sail through the elections by delivering high-sounding speeches. No difficulties arise if election promises are not kept later on, because the shu&#x301;dra-minded shu&#x301;dras quickly forget them.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->It can be unequivocally stated that if only educated people instead of all adults were given the right to vote in any country, the governmental structure of most democratic countries would change. And if sadvipras alone had the right to vote, there would be no difference between the real world and the heaven people imagine.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->In a capitalistic social system or in a democratic structure the situation of middle-class people (the viks&#x301;ubdha shu&#x301;dras) is generally miserable. This is because they are the greatest critics of capitalism and the strongest opponents of exploitation. An increase in the number of viks&#x301;ubdha shu&#x301;dras in a society is an early omen of a possible shu&#x301;dra revolution. It is therefore the duty of those who want to create a world free of exploitation to help to increase the number of viks&#x301;ubdha shu&#x301;dras. It will be harmful for the revolution if these people die or are transformed into shu&#x301;dra-minded shu&#x301;dras. All the sadvipras in the world should be vigilant to make sure that the number of viks&#x301;ubdha shu&#x301;dras does not decrease due to unemployment, birth control, or other bad practices or policies.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..24"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->Democratic Change<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->Revolution means a great change. In order to bring about such a change it is not inevitable that there will be killing and bloodshed. If the ks&#x301;atriya-minded viks&#x301;ubdha shu&#x301;dras are in the majority, or are most influential, however, the revolution will indeed come about through bloody clashes. Iit cannot be unequivocally stated that a revolution can never be brought about through intellectual clash, without bloodshed &ndash; it is possible, if there are a large number of influential vipra-minded shu&#x301;dras among the viks&#x301;ubdha shu&#x301;dras. But we cannot have much hope that this will be the case; so it has to be said that the liberation of the people generally involves bloodshed.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->Some people claim that they will be able to bring about socialism or communism or the liberation of the people through democratic methods. Generally speaking, a welfare state is based on the same principles. They often say that England, France and some other democratic countries are progressing towards socialism. But I would ask, what is the use of tortoise-like progress such as this? Many countries which do not follow a democratic system have brought about the welfare of their population with greater speed than has Great Britain within a democratic structure, over a period of hundreds of years. In this situation speed is the most important factor.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->Countries that exploited their colonies used to make efforts to promote the welfare of their population within the democratic structure, but if they had wanted to contribute to social welfare and had stayed outside the democratic framework, preferring instead the path of shu&#x301;dra revolution, they would have progressed faster, and without exploiting any colonies. In fact, in a democratic structure the people&#146;s progress is very slow. It cannot be called revolution; rather it is evolution, that is, gradual change.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->If undeveloped countries avoid the path of revolution and choose the path of slow change, or deliberately ignore the defects in democratic socialism or in the concept of a welfare state, the welfare of their people will never be anything but castles in the air. In order to secure votes in a democratic structure, the assistance of thieves, thugs and other antisocial elements is required. These antisocial elements certainly do not support candidates selflessly. They expect that when their candidate becomes a minister he or she will then turn a blind eye to the antisocial behaviour of their supporters.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->One of the most important basic features of socialism is cooperative bodies. Cooperative bodies cannot survive unless the state administration is run by honest citizens. Similarly, a socialistic state cannot survive unless the cooperative organizations are run by honest citizens. Hence if the public does not have a very high moral, spiritual and educational standard (an average standard or above average standard will not suffice), we cannot expect to find worthy people as representatives, as ministers, or as directors of cooperative bodies. Dishonest directors of cooperative institutions will steal money; dishonest ministers will indirectly support such activities; and weak-minded ministers will deliberately avoid looking into those activities out of fear of losing their ministerships, or in hopes of securing votes in the future. If such abuses continue, it will never be possible to build up cooperative institutions, corruption will never be flushed out of the courts and secretariats, and socialism will never be established.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->It is extremely difficult, although not totally impossible, to attain the high moral standard necessary to establish socialism within a democratic structure. Thus while democratic socialism is theoretically not bad, we cannot hope that it will ever be possible in the real world.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..31"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->Post-Revolution<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->Whether they have ks&#x301;atriya intellects or vipras intellects, the viks&#x301;ubdha shu&#x301;dras who take over the leadership of the shu&#x301;dra revolution are ks&#x301;atriyas in terms of their courage, personal force and capacity to take risks. After the shu&#x301;dra revolution the leadership of society passes to the viks&#x301;ubdha shu&#x301;dras, at which point their ks&#x301;atriya qualities become still more strongly expressed. In the post-revolutionary period they cannot be called viks&#x301;ubdha shu&#x301;dras; by that time they have become the ks&#x301;atriyas of the second rotation of the social cycle.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->The moral, spiritual fighters who keep an eye on the ks&#x301;atriyas to ensure they do not descend into an exploitative role in the future, are called sadvipras. If the ks&#x301;atriyas descend into exploitation, the sadvipras will fight them and establish the Vipra Age in the second rotation of the social cycle. If the vipras descend into exploitation, they will also fight against the vipras and initiate the Vaeshya Age of the second rotation. And if the vaeshyas descend or wish to descend into an exploitative role, the sadvipras will inspire the viks&#x301;ubdha shu&#x301;dras and bring about a second shu&#x301;dra revolution.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->The social cycle will rotate continuously. Nobody can stop its rotation. If the post-revolutionary Ks&#x301;atriya Age is called thesis, the steps taken by the sadvipras against the ks&#x301;atriyas who descend into exploitation are called antithesis. The post-revolutionary Vipra Age which evolves out of this conflict is called synthesis. If, in a later period, the vipras wish to descend into exploitation, the steps that the sadvipras take against them are called antithesis. Therefore the post-ks&#x301;atriya Vipra Age cannot be called synthesis at that time. It can be called the thesis of the next stage.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->Nobody can stop the rotation of the social cycle, not even the sadvipras. They stay in the nucleus of the social cycle, wakefully and vigilantly observing the process of rotation. One after another, one age follows the next: Vipra after Ks&#x301;atriya, Vaeshya after Vipra. The sadvipras cannot stop this process.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..36"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph -->After the establishment of the post-revolutionary Ks&#x301;atriya Age, the sadvipras will have to keep a vigilant eye on the ks&#x301;atriyas so that they, as the representatives of ks&#x301;atriya society, only rule and do not descend into an exploitative role. When they show signs of beginning to exploit, the sadvipras will immediately create an antithesis to end the Ks&#x301;atriya Age. They will do the same thing in the Vipra and Vaeshya Ages. In other words, they will not allow society to follow the process of natural evolution. They will bring about social revolution whenever necessary.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..37"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=37 type=paragraph -->So the sadvipras will have no rest. A time will never come in the life of a sadvipra when he or she will be able to sit back in an armchair and say, &ldquo;Ah, I have nothing to do today. Today I will have a nice rest.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="6..39"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=39 type=paragraph -->So far in the first rotation of human history on this earth, no sadvipra society has been formed. In most countries the last stage of the first rotation is in progress. In a few countries the post-shu&#x301;dra-revolution Ks&#x301;atriya Age has been established, and here and there the first indications of the Vipra Age are beginning to emerge. As there is no sadvipra society, the social cycle is rotating in a natural way.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..40"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=40 type=paragraph -->In every age the dominant social class first governs, then starts to exploit, after which evolution or revolution takes place. Due to the lack of sadvipras to lend their help, the foundations of human society fail to become strong.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..41"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=41 type=paragraph -->Today I earnestly request all rational, spiritual, moral, fighting people to build a sadvipra society without any further delay. Sadvipras will have to work for all countries, for the all-round liberation of all human beings. The downtrodden people of this persecuted world look to the eastern horizon, eagerly awaiting their advent. Let the blackness of the new-moon night be lifted from the path of the downtrodden. Let the new human beings of a new day wake up to a new sunrise in a new world. With these good wishes I conclude my discourse.<!-- /block --></p>
