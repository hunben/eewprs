This physical world, known as Prapain&#x32D;ca (quinquelemental world), resides only within the scope of mental and supra-mental substance. Innumerable are the vibrations, but not infinite. Had they been infinite, creation too, would have been infinite. True, they are many, but not infinite. There are three chief colours &ndash; white, red and black. White indicates the sentient principle, red the mutative, and black the static principle. The singular Purus&#x301;a creates colours. With these colours, He attracts.

<a name="6..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Pran&#x301;ipa&#x301;ta means complete surrender to the Eternal Entity, Parama Purus&#x301;a. The mental attitude that &ldquo;whatever is, is from Parama Purus&#x301;a and nothing is mine&rdquo; is pran&#x301;ipa&#x301;ta. One who has ego, one who thinks that one&#146;s intellect, wealth and other things are one&#146;s own, is the greatest fool.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->A person boasts of learning, intellect and fortune. But nothing is eternal. Therefore one who boasts of anything of this world is a fool. The worst psychic knot is the false vanity of intellect. Whatever is, is of Parama Purus&#x301;a; nothing is yours. Hence there should be complete surrender to Parama Purus&#x301;a. This is the first indispensable factor for mental development. If you really want to serve the world, complete surrender at the feet of Parama Purus&#x301;a is a must.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->That is, submission to the Eternal Entity, to Parama Purus&#x301;a, is pran&#x301;ipa&#x301;ta. The possessor of this creation is that very Parama Purus&#x301;a. All these works belong to Him. We are only His media. If I don&#146;t do the works entrusted to me, he will get them done by others. Before doing any work, I must think that Parama Purus&#x301;a is doing this work through me.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->In his lifetime, the bull that you see anywhere cries ham &ndash; that is, &ldquo;me&rdquo;. But after his death, only the sound Tun&#x32D;, Tun&#x32D;, Tun&#x32D; &ndash; You, only You &ndash; comes from the dhunurii [apparatus used for combing cotton] which is made of the fibre of his skin.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->For this, it is to be remembered always that I am not doing anything, Parama Purus&#x301;a is Himself doing all these things. While doing all these things, the individual entity should not get entangled in the trap of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;. One should not be proud of his or her post, position, beauty, wealth, honour or knowledge. All belong to the Divine Entity, Parama Purus&#x301;a; nothing is mine.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Pariprashna means those questions which are responsible for our spiritual elevation. The exhibition of pedanticism and questions of such kind are causes for the waste of time and energy. These things are all useless. There should be no questions other than pariprashna. Outside of this, there is waste of one&#146;s own time and that of others.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Seva&#x301; means &ldquo;selfless service&rdquo;. Service is there where there is no desire to get anything in return. When there is a desire to take while giving, it is not service, but business. Any kind of business is attached to give-and-take. In many newspapers one comes across many advertisements of business establishments &ndash; &ldquo;In your service since such-and-such year.&rdquo; No, it is not service, it is business, because the person does not give anything without taking something. So in service there is only giving and no question of taking. Even if somebody gives in return, the mental attitude should be not to take anything &ndash; this alone is service.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->There is a word which is generally used by devotees &ndash; prapatti. It means &ldquo;full self-submission&rdquo;. Everything is done by Parama&#x301;tman, by the Divine Entity. Aprapatti, on the other hand, means the mental attitude that all is done by individuals and not by Parama Purus&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->With these three factors, you will get spiritual elevation. Except for these, nothing else will benefit you in any way. You have come for a very short span of time. Therefore utilize the time to the maximum. Serve the world with the feeling of service. Render service in all the spheres of life &ndash; physical, psychic and spiritual.<!-- /block --></p>

There more the so-called civilization is developing, the more persons are degenerating, minds are falling and the number of sinners is increasing. Then is there no future for the sinner? What is this? If the reactions of all the actions are to be reaped completely, liberation and salvation will be a far cry. There is certainly a future for sinners. Parama Purus&#x301;a will certainly do something for those who have taken refuge in Him. It is said about Parama Purus&#x301;a that He is the Lord of both hell and heaven. Those who remain in hell are also with Parama Purus&#x301;a, are also dear to Him. To give them love, Parama Purus&#x301;a will have to remain in hell with them. What does Parama Purus&#x301;a do?

To take something without permission is known as stealing. So Parama Purus&#x301;a steals, and therefore He is known as &ldquo;Hari&rdquo; &ndash; you have taken refuge in Hari. There is no need to worry any more. In hell also Parama Purus&#x301;a will be with you.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="11..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->In this shloka the attributes of Purus&#x301;a or the Supreme Consciousness have been explained. We know that in the process of creation the Cosmic Mind is created. This Cosmic Mind has its waves, Its mental faculty; so, also, in the latter stages, when the unit mind is created, it has its mental flow. The Cosmic Mind is certainly infinite, and the entire creation is His kingdom. He is its sovereign ruler. For the unit mind, it is really impossible to challenge the authority of that Supreme Mind, because all unit minds are within His mental arena, within the periphery of that Cosmic Mind. In fact, the Universe is the thought projection of the Cosmic Mind. Whatever the unit mind thinks or does, it is immediately known to Him, because all the actional expressions are within the scope of that Cosmic Entity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Now, you have a brain with a small cranium; your mental capacity is therefore limited. The Cosmic Entity does not require a brain, because everything is internal for Him. You think with your small brain, whereas He thinks with His Infinite Mind. You see with your two eyes, with the limited capacity of your optical nerves and optical fibres, but He sees with His infinite eyes, watching every activity at the same time. Because of this Cosmic nature, His eyes are everywhere; whatever you can see, He sees, and whatever you cannot see, that also He sees. The pictures of others&#146; minds are constantly passing through His mind. You have two small legs, and it takes some time for you to reach Calcutta from Patna. You cannot remain in Calcutta and in Patna at the same time. But, because of His Cosmic nature, His legs are everywhere. To go to Calcutta from Patna, He need not leave Patna. That is, He is everywhere; He sees everything; He watches everything; He is everything. This quinquelemental universe is His object. He is the Supreme Subjectivity, and everything else is objectivity. Man controls the quinquelemental expression of the lower kos&#x301;as by the higher kos&#x301;as and all the kos&#x301;as are controlled by the sahasra&#x301;ra cakra. That means that the sahasra&#x301;ra cakra is above everything in this quinquelemental Universe. The sahasra&#x301;ra cakra is the seat of the supreme entity, and therefore the sahasra&#x301;ra cakra is the final controlling point.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The Cosmic Purus&#x301;a knows the past and the future. Here is has been said that He knows the past and the future. Nothing has been said about the present. What is the present? A certain portion of the past and a certain portion of the future that you can remember very easily, grasp very easily, is known as the present time. If there is a conversation between two persons, whenever one says something, the other person hears after a few second (because air takes some time to carry sound waves) and the other man hears it. It is past for the speaker and future for the present time. The Cosmic Entity knows the past and future of &ldquo;sarva&rdquo;. &ldquo;Sa&rdquo; is the acoustic root of the sentient principle, &ldquo;ra&rdquo; represent energy, and &ldquo;va&rdquo; means &ldquo;characteristic.&rdquo; Everything is born out of the sentient principle, and everything is controlled by energy, and everything has its characteristic. So, everything is therefore controlled by sarva, and sarva means everything. The Cosmic Purus&#x301;a knows everything. According to Ananda Marga philosophy, there is no question of heaven and hell. So you must not encourage helplessness. He is present in hell and heaven. So you are never alone. You must never encourage the psychology of helplessness. Parama Purus&#x301;a is always with you. That Supreme Entity is in love with you, and therefore you must not suffer from any kind of inferiority complex. Make Him the goal of your life and become an emancipated being.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="12..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The fundamental difference between man and an animal is that whatever an animal does, it does according to the rules of Parama Purus&#x301;a, according to its inborn instincts. Whatever a man does, he does according to his will and mental force. An animal lacks a developed mind, and a man has a developed mind. So if a man does not utilize his developed mind, he will be worse than an animal. Because of the individual body, there are psychic differences, caused by various reactive momenta. A man may do something good; he may do something bad also, or he may eventually have recourse to negative pratisain&#x32D;cara.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->What is pa&#x301;pa? That which should not be done, if done, is called &ldquo;pa&#x301;pa&rdquo;. That which should be done, if not done, is called &ldquo;pratyava&#x301;ya.&rdquo; The collective name of pa&#x301;pa and pratyava&#x301;ya is &ldquo;pa&#x301;taka.&rdquo; The sins committed by a pa&#x301;takii are not of very serious nature. The redemption of a pa&#x301;takii is possible if one, forgetting whatever has been done, takes to the path of spirituality. The second form of a pa&#x301;takii is atipa&#x301;takii. This is one who has done permanent physical or mental damage to a particular person. Then the third type is maha&#x301;pa&#x301;takii. The sins committed by a maha&#x301;pa&#x301;takii are of recurring nature. The best course for an atipa&#x301;takii is to sacrifice his individual pleasure and involve himself in the welfare of humanity. But of course the maha&#x301;pa&#x301;takii has to sacrifice his life for the welfare of mankind. In addition to that, he will have to do something which will be of permanent benefit for human beings.<!-- /block --></p>

The sun gets energy<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.14.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#14.fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> from the Cosmological Nucleus. There are countless solar systems in the Cosmos. And for all these solar systems, the hub is Parama Purus&#x301;a, Purus&#x301;ottama. He is the Nucleus of all energy. The sun gets energy from Him alone &ndash; therefore Ra&#x301;ti mahiidhara.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->The third meaning of &ldquo;Ra&#x301;ma&rdquo; is Ra&#x301;van&#x301;asya maran&#x301;am Ra&#x301;ma [&ldquo;Ra&#x301;ma is the death of Ra&#x301;van&#x301;a&rdquo;]. The first syllable of Ra&#x301;van&#x301;asya and the first syllable of maran&#x301;am go to make up &ldquo;Ra&#x301;ma&rdquo;. And what is Ra&#x301;van&#x301;a? In the Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a there is something regarding Ra&#x301;van&#x301;a. (The Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a is a mythological book, it is not history.) Ra&#x301;van&#x301;a means a ten-faced demon. That is, Ra&#x301;van&#x301;a represents the extroverted human mind moving, functioning, in ten directions &ndash; moving towards crudeness, away from the Nucleus &ndash; being drifted away by the centrifugal force. How can one be saved from crudification? Ra&#x301;van&#x301;a can be defeated, can be destroyed, only when one takes shelter in Ra&#x301;ma. That&#146;s why He is Ra&#x301;van&#x301;asya maran&#x301;am: when one takes shelter in Parama Purus&#x301;a, Ra&#x301;van&#x301;a automatically dies. So one under whom Ra&#x301;van&#x301;a automatically dies is &ldquo;Ra&#x301;ma&rdquo; &ndash; Ra&#x301;van&#x301;asya maran&#x301;am &ndash; the first syllable of Ra&#x301;van&#x301;a, and the first syllable of maran&#x301;am.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="15..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The word &ldquo;Ra&#x301;van&#x301;a&rdquo; is made up of &ldquo;Rao&rdquo; + &ldquo;Ana&rdquo; = &ldquo;Ra&#x301;van&#x301;a&rdquo; &ndash; that which pushes one into downfall, into naraka &ndash; raorava naraka. The degraded human mind, working in ten directions, is Ra&#x301;van&#x301;a. Ra&#x301;van&#x301;a is mythological, not historical.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->There are four kinds of Sam&#x301;skrta literature &ndash; ka&#x301;vya (a beautiful presentation of events); Pura&#x301;n&#x301;a (an imaginary but educative story); itikatha&#x301; (a factual registration of events); and itiha&#x301;sa (a registration of factual events with educative value). Veda Vya&#x301;sa wrote eighteen Pura&#x301;n&#x301;as &ndash; imaginary stories; some of them might even have been against philosophy, so he has begged the Lord&#146;s pardon in a sloka.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->What is the most brilliant? Because everything else takes energy from the nucleus of the cosmological order, that is the most brilliant, the most glittering. Anything, small or big, has a cyclic order. An atom has nucleus and electrons. The moon revolves around out earth, and planets revolve around the sun; the solar system revolves around the nucleus of the whole cosmological system. Hence the sun is significant in comparison with Parama Purus&#x301;a. Electricity also takes energy, directly or indirectly from the sun. The sun and other manifestations take energy from Him. He is the most glittering entity; others are His reflected light. He is the most glittering object in the Universe.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Any energy is invisible. We see the operation and action of electrical energy through lights, fans, etc. Similarly, no one has ever seen the sun &ndash; only its action. It looks round, but from a short distance it is simply like something burning. So electricity and the sun are things to feel only. The same is the case with the mind. No one can show his mind, nor can one see one&#146;s own mind. One can only feel. Similarly, Parama Purus&#x301;a is only to be felt and realized. The mind has its expression through the body. Somebody boasts of knowledge &ndash; intellectualism. This is a type of mental expression. When you feel existence totally, you can become an altered personality. You &ldquo;see&rdquo; a ghost. You create a negative hallucination. When, due to fear, the total being is contracted, the mind is objectivated. Similarly, if the whole mind is filled with the feeling of Parama Purus&#x301;a, you can hardly bear &ndash; nor can you express &ndash; the bliss. You feel; you can only enjoy it!<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Man can not do anything small or big. You are just like a middleman. He does everything with His energy.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->There is a story in the Upanis&#x301;ad. Once Indra, the leader of the devata&#x301;s, approached Parama Purus&#x301;a, the source of all energies for some instruction. He spoke a word, &ldquo;da.&rdquo; The devata&#x301;s interpreted it as &ldquo;damanam kuru&rdquo; (control of one&#146;s baser propensities&#146;). Human beings and asuras also approached Him. He spoke the same word to both of them. The human beings interpreted it as &ldquo;daya&#x301;m kuru&rdquo; (show mercy) and the Asuras interpreted it as &ldquo;Da&#x301;nam kuru&rdquo; (donate). Therefore there is found among the Asuras a great donor like King Maha Bali.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="16..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->To attain Paramatattva (The Supreme Stance), there are three recognized means &ndash; jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na (intellectual knowledge), karma (action), and bhakti (devotion). Everybody has accepted, and Sham&#x301;kara&#x301;ca&#x301;rya, who has been considered the greatest philosopher in India, has also said in unambiguous language, that &ldquo;Moks&#x301;a ka&#x301;ran&#x301;asamagra&#x301;m&#x301; bhaktireva gariiyasi&rdquo; &ndash; for salvation, devotion is the best approach. Bhakti is greater than jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na and karma. What is bhakti? The root word &ldquo;bhaj&rdquo; and the suffix &ldquo;ktin&rdquo; make the word &ldquo;bhakti.&rdquo; &ldquo;Bhaj&rdquo; means moving towards that Supreme Entity without any second thought. When all your sentiments, all your aspirations, move towards that Singular Entity without any second thought, then that psychic movement of yours if called &ldquo;bhakti.&rdquo; The flow of this very devotion is prema (divine love). When this flow is not towards anything else, but towards Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u, it alone is prema. &ldquo;Ananyamamata&rdquo; vis&#x301;n&#x301;ormamata&#x301; premasaun&#x32D;gata&#x301;. &ldquo;Mamata&#x301;&rdquo; means &ldquo;mine-ness&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;Mama&rdquo; means &ldquo;one&#146;s own&rdquo;, and the abstract noun derived from it is &ldquo;mamata&#x301;&rdquo; &ndash; meaning, thereby &ldquo;mine-ness.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="16..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->There should not be any amalgamation in devotion. For example, people mix copper in gold, but there should be no mixture in bhakti. Bhakti should be shuddha&#x301; bhakti, unadulterated devotion; that is, there should not be any covert desire in the mind. If there is a second thought, it might be that that desire will be satiated; but Parama Purus&#x301;a will remain unattained. The covert desire was your main desire, and devotion was a show. This will not do.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->What is this shuddha&#x301; bhakti? &ldquo;I want nothing from you. I love you. I love you because by loving you I get pleasure.&rdquo; This alone is ra&#x301;ga&#x301;nuga&#x301; bhakti or shuddha&#x301; bhakti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->But this ra&#x301;ga&#x301;nuga&#x301; bhakti is not final. In ra&#x301;ga&#x301;nuga&#x301; bhakti, the idea is that you love Him because by doing so you derive pleasure. Greater devotees don&#146;t even like this. They love God, not because they get pleasure, but because He gets pleasure. To give him pleasure is what they want. &ldquo;I don&#146;t even want pleasure for myself. I want to please you; therefore I love you.&rdquo; This alone is the supreme devotion. This is known as &ldquo;ra&#x301;ga&#x301;tmika&#x301; bhakti&rdquo;. &ldquo;Gopayate yah sah gopah&rdquo; &ndash; those who do this ra&#x301;ga&#x301;tmika&#x301; bhakti are known as &ldquo;gopa&rdquo;. In Laokika Sam&#x301;skrta, &ldquo;gopa&rdquo; means &ldquo;one who rears cows.&rdquo; But, in philosophical language, it is not so. &ldquo;Gopayate&rdquo; means to give pleasure. So, those whose nature is to give pleasure to Parama&#x301;tman are Gopa. In devotional scriptures it is said that Parama&#x301;tman is a slave to the Gopas.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Hence, everybody should encourage ra&#x301;ga&#x301;tmika&#x301; bhakti, because this alone is the most blissful means of attaining emancipation. There is no alternative.<!-- /block --></p>

If He does not remain in the hearts of yogiis, where does He remain? But if Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a says it, what should I say? We have to got to accept it.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Who is a yogii?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..8"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Sam&#x301;yoga yoga ityukta&#x301; jiiva&#x301;tma&#x301; Parama&#x301;tmanah<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..9"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->When jiiva&#x301;tma&#x301; (unit consciousness) and Parama&#x301;tma&#x301; (Cosmic Consciousness) become one, that is yoga. The word yoga originates from the Sam&#x301;skrta root word &ldquo;yuin&#x32D;j&rdquo; plus &ldquo;ghain&#x32D;.&rdquo; It means &ldquo;addition.&rdquo; If two plus two becomes four, the components can manage to keep their separate existences. Two mangoes plus two mangoes are four mangoes; but these four mangoes can be of four different types, though these two have become four. In this case, they have not become one; their separate existences are not united. This kind of addition is not real yoga. Real yoga is there where there is unification (samarasa), i.e., that kind of addition in which separate entities do not exist at all. All become one. This alone is the real meaning of yoga. One who has become perfected in this kind of yoga is a yogii. The second meaning of yoga is &ldquo;yogascittavrtti nirodhah.&rdquo; When different propensities in human beings are suspended, that state is known as &ldquo;yoga,&rdquo; and one who has done this is a yogii.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->So, Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a says that He does not remain in the hearts of yogiis either. How strange it is! Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a is all pervasive. Is the heart of a yogii beyond sarva (all)? But there is an answer.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Madbhakta&#x301; yatra ga&#x301;yante tatra tis&#x301;t&#x301;ha&#x301;mi na&#x301;rada.&rdquo; &ndash; Where devotees sing my name, there alone I remain. O Na&#x301;rada, I transfer my nucleus to that place. What is the meaning of &ldquo;Na&#x301;rada?&rdquo; There are three meanings of the word &ldquo;na&#x301;ra&rdquo; in Sam&#x301;skrta. One meaning of &ldquo;na&#x301;ra&rdquo; is &ldquo;niira,&rdquo; water. The second meaning is &ldquo;Parama&#x301; Prakrti&rdquo; (Supreme Creative Principle), from which the word Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a has come. The third meaning of the word na&#x301;ra is &ldquo;devotion.&rdquo; &ldquo;Na&#x301;ra&rdquo; plus &ldquo;da&rdquo;. The word&#x301;da&#x301; has come from the root word, &ldquo;da&rdquo;, which means &ldquo;giver.&rdquo; One who distributes devotion is Na&#x301;rada. So it is said, to Na&#x301;rada, &ldquo;I transfer my nucleus to the place where my devotees sing my name.&rdquo; Why? Because in devotees there is upsurge (Ucchava&#x301;sa) and emotion (A&#x301;vega). With the help of that emotion, I radiate vibrations in the universe.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->How can vibrations emanate from the heart of a yogii who has closed all the ten doors of his person by suspending his propensities? Even if Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a shifts His nucleus there, His radiation cannot unfold therefrom.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->But if He seats Himself in the midst of devotees, the entire universe is vibrated with that vibration. The object of Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a will be served in this very thing. Hence, it is wise on the part of Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a to remain the heart of devotees. It is true that Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a is everywhere, but the origin (sphuran&#x301;a), radiation (viksuran&#x301;a) and sensation (spandana) of His vibration will not be everywhere. He is everywhere, but that vibration originates from that place where His nucleus is. He seats that nucleus at that place where devotees sing His name. What can be a better place than that?<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="18..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Purus&#x301;ottama is the nucleus of this Cosmological system. In the atomic system, there is a nucleus, and so many electrons are moving around the nucleus. Similarly, in our global system, the earth is the nucleus, and the moon is moving round the earth; in the solar system, the sun is the nucleus, and so many planets are moving round it. In the Cosmological system, Purus&#x301;ottama is the nucleus, and so many objects are moving round It, so many solar systems are moving round that Nucleus. But there is a speciality of this Cosmological flow. In other systems, that is, in smaller systems, movement is in the realm of physicality, but, in the case of the Cosmological nucleus, the movement is not only in the physical status but also in the psychic stratum. That is, all are also moving round Him mentally &ndash; knowingly or unknowingly. Those who move round Him knowingly &ndash; dancing round Him knowingly &ndash; are fortunate, are very lucky. Others are moving round Him unknowingly, and, with all their movement, sometimes they, unknowingly, unconsciously by their crude objectivity increase their radius. Sometimes they decrease their radius. When, because of lack of knowledge, the radius is increased, they feel sorrow, and when that radius decreases they get pleasure. So this is the speciality of the Cosmological Nucleus. In other nuclei, in the case of other nuclei, the movement is just physical. Everybody should always remember that each and every mental creation, each and every mental force, is moving round that Supreme Nucleus. You should have subjective approach and objective adjustment. Dharmacakra is subjective approach. He is the Supreme subject; all others are his objects. When the sensory organs and motor organs are the objects, your mind is the subject. When mind is the object, your a&#x301;tman is the subject. And when a&#x301;tman is the object, Parama&#x301;tman is the subject. So, Paramat&#x301;man is the Supreme Subjectivity. And the supra-mental world &ndash; atima&#x301;nas kos&#x301;a of Brahma &ndash; is the crudest objectivity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Where there is knowledge, but no devotion, there such people try to establish their speciality. And, as this endeavour to establish one&#146;s speciality becomes more important than finding the Supreme, people fail to find the Supreme Veracity.<!-- /block --></p>

His a&#x301;virbha&#x301;va (advent) was just at a crucial time &ndash; humanity was suffering then. He removed the suffering of humanity by creating Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata. He gave an assurance to the entire world that there would not be degradation of dharma, that He would come and save it.<!-- /block --></p>

What is the meaning of &ldquo;Bha&#x301;rata&rdquo;? Bhar plus al means &ldquo;the supplier of food&rdquo;. Ta means &ldquo;all-round development&rdquo;. One who seeks to provide human beings with food, so that they can maintain their existence and attain psychic development, is &ldquo;Bha&#x301;rata&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Up to thirty-nine years the physical body develops, then it decays. On a psycho-spiritual level, one develops up to the end of one&#146;s life. Where development can happen, that part of the land is bha&#x301;ratavars&#x301;a &ndash; indicating a country. Vars&#x301;a means a part of the globe. It must be added to bha&#x301;rata, as bha&#x301;rata itself does not indicate a country.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Until the Aryans reached India, they had to wander to maintain their lives. Reaching here, the problems of both their physical maintenance and psychic development were solved. Therefore the country was called &ldquo;Bha&#x301;ratavars&#x301;a&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a addresses Arjuna as &ldquo;Bha&#x301;rata&rdquo;. Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a wanted people to take the responsibility of physico-psycho-spiritual development. Therefore He addresses him as &ldquo;Bha&#x301;rata&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->What is gla&#x301;ni [in the shloka (couplet)]? It is a lower state, beneath the generally-accepted standard. When dharma goes lower than its accepted standard, it is said to suffer gla&#x301;ni. For instance, the commonly-accepted place for a crown is the head; if someone wears it on his foot, it can be considered to have suffered degradation. So Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a says that where there is degradation in dharma and adharma rises &ndash; when people&#146;s hats decorate their feet, and their sandals, their heads &ndash; He comes as Ta&#x301;raka Brahma [Liberating Brahma] to reinstate dharma to its original status. Under such circumstances, the actions of ordinary people cut no ice. Then He creates tat a&#x301;tma&#x301; &ndash; tada&#x301;tma&#x301; [in the shloka], that is, Ta&#x301;raka Brahma. Ta&#x301;raka Brahma polarizes dharma and adharma. He makes them prepared to fight.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Whenever dharma comes into a secondary position,  a degraded position, a depraved position; that is, dharma is being defeated by adharma in that temporary phase of the war &ndash; finally dharma wins, but you know, a war is divided into several phases, and each and every phase is known as a battle. So in one battle, adharma may win, in another battle, dharma may win, but finally, as a result of the final fight of the war, dharma wins. Hence, O human beings, do not get scared, light is sure to come after darkness.<!-- /block --></p>

Pa&#x301;taka includes both pa&#x301;pa and pratyava&#x301;ya. You should not steal, and, if you do, you commit pa&#x301;pa. You should assist a helpless person, and, if you do not, you commit pratyava&#x301;ya.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Pa&#x301;pa seems good as long as we do not get the reaction of our pa&#x301;pa. Have you seen a washerman washing clothes in an Indian town? He lifts the clothes he is washing high up in the air, and the clothes think they are moving up and feel elated. But they do not realize that the higher they are raised, the harder they are hit against the washing stone. The persons who commit pa&#x301;pa are like those clothes who think that they are having a nice time and are moving up. They enjoy themselves in pa&#x301;pa. But when they suffer the reaction of pa&#x301;pa, they find themselves in misery, like the clothes they get beaten on the stone.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->There is a difference between &ldquo;svaccha&rdquo; and &ldquo;bhadra.&rdquo; Svaccha means good or clean; for example, the water is svaccha (clean). Bhadra means internally and externally good. Bhadra persons are very cautious before doing anything. They think what the reaction of their action would be. They do good and keep doing good, even if they do not immediately obtain the good reaction of their benevolent deeds. They do not mind suffering till they start getting the good reactions of their good deeds. And once the reactions of their good deeds begin, then there is bliss and only bliss.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->While doing evil, people may enjoy themselves. But when they start reaping the reactions of their evil deeds, there is only misery. A dishonest person travels without a ticket in a first class compartment. He wants to cheat the railways and have fun. But an honest person will buy a second class ticket and may travel in great discomfort. The dishonest person has fun, but only for some time. The ticket checking squad comes and fines him or arrests him. He has to hang his head in shame. But the honest man (though poor) reaches his destination honourably. The dishonest person has misery in the end. The honest person lives a clean life and remains happy with what he has. The dishonest man accepts bribes and indulges in various corrupt practices. He does not pay his income tax and builds a palace for himself. But one day the income tax officials raid his house and prosecute him for tax evasion and amassing ill-gotten wealth. He lands in jail.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->So, before you commit any pa&#x301;pa, you should think about its adverse reaction, immediate or subsequent. In good action, there may be some pain, but the reaction will always be beneficent.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Do good. But do not be arrogant and vainglorious. Arrogance and false pride can ruin Ananda Marga.<!-- /block --></p>

But later, when Buddha sat in contemplation (after eating some sweet rice made in milk which was given to him by Suja&#x301;ta&#x301;), he took a complete sam&#x301;kalpa.

We don&#146;t want this changing world; it gives us pain. It converts our happiness into unhappiness. The second word is &ldquo;tamas.&rdquo; Where there is tamas there is no essence of spirituality.

<a name="29..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->People do japa kriya&#x301; in a very crude manner. It can be said that their method of incantation is like the talk of a parrot. Parrots talk, parrot say so many things, without understanding the meaning, without understanding the spirit of what is meant. Japa kriya&#x301; becomes as meaningless as the talk of a parrot for those who do it without love or emotion. It even loses the value of internal suggestion, intro-psychic suggestion.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Japa kriya&#x301; is withdrawing all propensities from their extroversive movements and guiding and goading their collective force unto the Supreme Cognition. Where the Supreme Cognition is not loved, where the Supreme Cognition has not been accepted as the only object of adoration, withdrawing one&#146;s propensities becomes meaningless, because they are not guided unto Him.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Dhya&#x301;na is withdrawing the mental propensities from all extroversive entities, and then collecting those withdrawn mental forces, mental propensities, and urging them towards the Supreme Entity. If there is no love for the Supreme Entity, this movement cannot be done. Where there is no love, the mind will not run after Him. So dhya&#x301;na also becomes meaningless.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Dhya&#x301;na&rdquo; comes from the root verb &ldquo;dhae,&rdquo; which means to withdraw the mental propensities and to goad them towards Him. So, if people practice all these things without having love for the Supreme, they won&#146;t be able to get anything. But, if there is an iota of love, if there is a wee bit of love, they gain everything. Only those intelligent people who know this &ndash; even if if they are not efficient or proficient in the sphere of dharma; even if they are not efficient in doing japa kriya&#x301;; even if they know nothing regarding yoga; even if they know nothing regarding celestial and extra-celestial knowledge; even if they do not understand guru bhakti; even if they do not understand the inner spirit of japa; even if they do not know jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na &ndash; can get everything if the spirit behind this idea of loving the Supreme is just in a rudimental phase. In a later phase it becomes, &ldquo;I love Him not to get anything; I love Him because I get pleasure in loving Him &ndash; and for no other purpose.&rdquo; And in the final stage the devotee feels that, &ldquo;I love Him, not to get any pleasure for myself. I love Him, because I want my love to give Him pleasure.&rdquo; That is purely unilateral, not reciprocal. Where there is the idea of reciprocity, it is not devotion, it is an ordinary commercial transaction &ndash; give some money, get some article. Here the devotee wants to give everything to the Supreme Entity and wants nothing in return. I love you, not for myself. I love you because I want my love to give you pleasure. So, in that last, final stage, the devotee&#146;s only wish is to give Him pleasure. In Sam&#x301;skrta, the root verb &ldquo;gup&rdquo; means &ldquo;to give pleasure to&rdquo;, and the man who has developed this type of love for the Supreme is called &ldquo;gopa.&rdquo; &ldquo;Gopayate yah sah gopae&rdquo; &ndash; the one who gives pleasure to Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a is &ldquo;gopa.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="30..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->What is meant by &ldquo;bhakti&rdquo;? The word &ldquo;bhakti&rdquo; has been derived from the root verb &ldquo;bhaj&rdquo; by adding the suffix &ldquo;ktin&rdquo;. &ldquo;Bhaj&rdquo; means &ldquo;to call with devotion&rdquo;; that is to call the Lord with utmost devotion, taking Him to be everything of one&#146;s life, is bhakti. In other words, bhakti is to move towards Him after withdrawing all the expressions of one&#146;s mind.<!-- /block --></p>

That which governs or disciplines for liberation or all-round salvation is sha&#x301;stra. In the case where the parents govern their children only for the sake of governing, when the children grow up and realize this they begin to disobey them. But where the discipline and control is aimed at salvation or liberation, that discipline is the discipline of shastra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->And what is bhagava&#x301;n? The word has been derived form the root word &ldquo;bhaga&rdquo; plus &ldquo;maetup&rdquo; suffix. &ldquo;Bhagava&#x301;n&rdquo; means one who possesses the following six qualities: a&#x301;eshvarya, pra&#x301;tapa, yasha, shrii, jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na and vaera&#x301;gya.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Aeshvarya&rdquo; means &ldquo;occult power&rdquo;, which in Sam&#x301;skrta is also known as &ldquo;vibhu&#x301;ti&rdquo;. &ldquo;Vibhu&#x301;ti&rdquo; has two meanings &ndash; &ldquo;ash&rdquo; and &ldquo;occult-powers&rdquo;. Here &ldquo;occult-powers&rdquo; are eight in number, namely an&#x301;ima&#x301;, mahima&#x301;, laghima&#x301;, pra&#x301;pti, praka&#x301;mya, vashistva, iishvaratva and antarya&#x301;mitva.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->In the English language, &ldquo;aeshvarya&rdquo; is known as &ldquo;occult power&rdquo;; that is, that which is acquired by cult is &ldquo;occult&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="30..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Yasha: By His advent two things happen simultaneously. On the one hand, He gets staunch supporters, and on the other, sworn enemies. The whole human society gets clearly divided into two camps &ndash; moralists and immoralists, the bad elements. Everyone has to join either of the two camps, and complete polarization takes place. If one is the North Pole, the other one is the South Pole. He is crowned with success and glory and at the same time faces bitter criticism and infamy.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->This happened to Lord Shiva and Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a also. During their time also the whole society got divided into two camps &ndash; the moralists and the immoralists. Remember always dha&#x301;rmic people are ultimately bound to be victorious.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Shrii: Shrii means &ldquo;attraction&rdquo;, the sweet touch of attraction. This word is made up of &ldquo;sha&rdquo;, &ldquo;ra&rdquo; and &ldquo;ii&rdquo;. &ldquo;Sha&rdquo; is the acoustic root of the mutative force, &ldquo;ra&rdquo; is the acoustic root of the actional faculty, &ldquo;ii&rdquo; denotes feminine gender. Hence &ldquo;shrii&rdquo; means &ldquo;one who possesses the actional faculty of the mutative force&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na: &ldquo;Jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na&rdquo; means &ldquo;knowledge of the self&rdquo; The knowledge of the self is the real knowledge. All other forms of knowledge are not knowledge at all, rather they are only shadows of knowledge. There is absence of true knowledge. This knowledge of the self can&#146;t be obtained from study of books, but can be acquired by merging all one&#146;s desires into Him, as He is knowledge incarnate and knowledge personified.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Vaera&#x301;gya: Non-attachment. In Sam&#x301;skrta the word &ldquo;vaera&#x301;gya&rdquo; has come from the root verb &ldquo;arinj&rdquo;, as has &ldquo;rain&#x32D;jana&rdquo;, which means &ldquo;to paint&rdquo; or &ldquo;to colour&rdquo; &ndash; that which colours the mind. &ldquo;Prabha&#x301;ta Rain&#x32D;jana&rdquo; means &ldquo;he who colours the dawn&rdquo;. Every object is vibrational and has its own colour. Due to the particular colour of an object, your mind gets attracted to it. So, you should not be attracted to the colour of any object.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->So it has been said, &ldquo;Bhaktirbhagavato seva&#x301;&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;Devotion is service to Bhagavat or Bhagava&#x301;n&rdquo;. Here Bhagava&#x301;n means &ldquo;He who has bhaga&rdquo;, that is, He who embodies all the above-mentioned six qualities. Bhakti is service to Bhagava&#x301;n.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Bhaktih premasvaru&#x301;pin&#x301;ii&rdquo; that is, &ldquo;devotion is pure love&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="30..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Bhakti bhaktasya jiivanam&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;Devotion is the life of devotees.&rdquo; Just as a fish cannot live without water, devotees cannot survive without devotion. Devotion is the essence, the very source, of life.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->What is then the most precious thing in human life? It is devotion. If one has gotten devotion, one has gotten everything, and nothing remains unrealized. Devotees have to serve the Lord.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->Now, what is the true service? To serve His creation is the real service. In common practice, we see that the parents are pleased when their sons or daughters are served. Similarly, the simplest and easiest way to please Me is to serve humanity. Forget whatever you were in the past, or whatever you did in the past, and from this auspicious moment on dedicate yourself to the service of humanity.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="31..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->I also said that one could ask for the same thing in the Gayatrii Mantra. It is incorrectly called Ga&#x301;yatrii Mantra. Its actual name is &ldquo;Savitr Rk&rdquo;. The Rk Veda, the oldest scripture in the world, is divided into several portions, and each and every portion is known as a man&#x301;d&#x301;ala and each and every man&#x301;d&#x301;ala is subdivided into several &ldquo;su&#x301;ktas&rdquo;. Each and every su&#x301;kta is further divided into &ldquo;rks&rdquo;. That is, each and every shloka of the Rk Veda is known as &ldquo;rk&rdquo;. That is why the Veda is known as the &ldquo;Rk Veda&rdquo;. This particular mantra, which is commonly known as the &ldquo;Ga&#x301;yatrii Mantra&rdquo;, is a rk of the third man&#x301;d&#x301;ala, sixty-second su&#x301;kta, tenth rk. In the Rk Veda, the rk is named by the word used in the rk for addressing the Supreme Entity. In this rk the Supreme Entity is addressed as &ldquo;Savita&#x301;&rdquo;. That is why it is known as the &ldquo;Savita&#x301;&rdquo; or &ldquo;Savitr Rk&rdquo;, &ldquo;the rk for Savita&#x301;&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="31..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->During the time of the Vedas people could not write. Scripts were not known to them. The guru would speak and disciples would listen. The ear is called &ldquo;shruti&rdquo; in Sam&#x301;skrta &ndash; That is why one of the names of the Vedas is &ldquo;Shruti&rdquo;. The disciples could not read because there was no script. The Sam&#x301;skrta language has no script of its own. It has been written in different local scripts throughout the ages.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="31..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->In the Savitr Rk it has been said.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="31..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->It is composed in a particular rhythm known as the ga&#x301;yatrii rhythm. In the Vedas there are seven recognized rhythms - ga&#x301;yatrii, us&#x301;n&#x301;ika, tris&#x301;t&#x301;upa, anus&#x301;t&#x301;apa, brhati, jagatii and paunkti. In gayatrii rhythm there should be three lines, and there must be eight syllables in each and every line. The rs&#x301;i who composed that mantra is known as the &ldquo;rs&#x301;i of the mantra&rdquo;. The rhythm in which it was composed is known as the &ldquo;chant of the mantra&rdquo;. This is the original mantra. The first portion is a later addition. It has been taken from the Atharva Veda, and is not a part of the original mantra. The three lines are: <ul> <li>first line &ndash; Tatsavitur varen&#x301;yam&#x301; <li>next line &ndash; Bhargo devasya dhiimahi <li>last line &ndash; Dhiyo yo nah pracodaya&#x301;t on&#x32D;m. </ul><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="31..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->There should be eight syllables in each and every line. Now the first line, &ldquo;Tatsavitur varen&#x301;yam&rdquo;, has seven syllables. As per rule there should be eight syllables. In the Vedic system whenever there is any clash between grammar and rhythm the rhythm is to be supported and not the grammar. Here, for the sake of rhythm, the correct pronunciation should be, &ldquo;Tatsavitur varen&#x301;i-yam&rdquo;. It has been cut into two portions.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="31..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->In this mantra what is the prayer for? &ldquo;O Lord, guide my mind, guide my thoughts towards bliss.&rdquo; This is the main idea, the central idea of this prayer.<!-- /block --></p>

What is &ldquo;on&#x32D;m&rdquo;? Whenever there is an expression, whenever you do something, there is a cosmic expression. If you are walking, you are moving, the sound &ldquo;khat-khat&rdquo; is created, so there is a cosmic expression. If you are laughing, the sound &ldquo;ha-ha-ha&rdquo; is created. Wherever there is any action or any actional expression, there must be an acoustic manifestation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="31..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->The Supreme Entity creates. To create is also an action, it is also work. During creation He creates with His mind. He creates nothing externally. He creates everything internally, because nothing is external for Him &ndash; everything is internal. This quinquelemental world, which is something external for us, is purely an internal phenomenon for him. Not phenomena, not the plural, because for him it is a singular expression. That sound is &ldquo;a-a-a-a-a-a&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="31..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Here &ldquo;a&rdquo; is the first letter of the Tantric alphabetical order. The first letter is &ldquo;a&rdquo;.

<a name="31..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Then after expression you have to preserve it &ndash; nourish it. The actional expression to preserve something is &ldquo;u&rdquo;. The sound is &ldquo;u&rdquo;. It is the acoustic expressions of preservation and nourishment. Hence &ldquo;u&rdquo; is the sound.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="31..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->After creating anything in your mind, what do you finally do? You withdraw these mental expressions or mental panoramas within yourself. This process of supreme withdrawal by Parama Purus&#x301;a is represented by the consonant &ldquo;ma&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="31..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->A-U-Ma therefore represents creation, preservation and destruction. Hence this mantra, this incantation, starts with the sound &ldquo;aum&rdquo;, &ldquo;om&rdquo;. He as Creator or Generator creates the sound &ldquo;a&rdquo;. He as Operator creates the sound &ldquo;u&rdquo; and He as Destroyer creates the sound &ldquo;ma&rdquo;. Generator, Operator, Destroyer; G-0-D - &ldquo;God&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="31..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->These expressions are septilineal, arranged in seven strata, seven layers. Broadly speaking they may be classified within the groups of three layers &ndash; the physical, psychic and astral worlds. The Cosmic Creator, Cosmic Generator, is the creator of the three, that is, the physical, psychic and astral worlds. He is the creator. Now who is the creator of the human body? He is the creator. Who is the creator of the human brain? He is the creator. So He is Savita&#x301;. &ldquo;Savita&#x301;&rdquo; means &ldquo;creator&rdquo;; &ldquo;savita&#x301;&rdquo; means &ldquo;father&rdquo;. For this little planet earth, the sun is savita&#x301;. The sun is the father. And for all these planetary systems, all the stars with their own planetary systems, He is the creator. The Cosmic Nucleus is the Father, Supreme Father.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="31..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->We meditate on the divine effulgence of that Supreme Cosmic Father who created these physical, psychic and astral worlds. And why do we meditate on His divine effulgence? So that He may guide our intellect unto the path of bliss.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="31..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->So before one gets initiation one may make a request before the Cosmic Father like this, &ldquo;O Lord, guide my intellect, goad my intellect unto the path of bliss, so that I may do something in this universe.&rdquo; And when one gets is&#x301;t&#x301;a mantra, gets initiation, then he is to do as per rules. He need not pray for anything else, because he has gotten initiation.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="32..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->All the manifestations of the world are vibrational. The fundamental reality is vibrational. It is so not only for the realm of those quinquelementalities, but also for the ectoplasmic and supra-ectoplasmic strata. These vibrational manifestations come in contact with the living being through different cells and organs. Amongst the sensory organs, the most important experience living beings acquire is ocular experience. Ocular experience is received through the optical nerves.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->In the realm of vision, colour is a very important factor. White represents the sentient principle, red represents the mutative principle, and black represents the static principle. There are seven controlling colours, and the process of permutation and combination to convey the large number of colours is not infinite. Had it been infinite in character, this expressed universe would also necessarily have been infinite. But actually this expressed universe is big, but not infinite.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->That singular entity, with the help of different expressions of Prakrti, or different &ndash; what should I say &ndash; tactics of Prakrti, can emanate innumerable vibrations. That is why it is said that although He Himself is colourless, His creation is in innumerable colours. It is a colourful universe, with so many colours attracting living beings.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->White is no colour. The combination of all the colours is white. Black is no colour. Want of colour is black.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->With the help of different manifestations of the Operative Principle, the noumenal cause remains a singular entity, but the phenomenal expressions are many. The noumenal world is singular in character; the phenomenal world is multifarious in character.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->But why does He create this universe of so many colours, where there is a mess of so much colour? Why? What for? What is the intention? Why does He create like this?<!-- /block --></p>

The inner spirit, the intention, is known only to Him and to nobody else, and whoever comes in close contact with Him, whoever is in deep love with Him, can understand the inner spirit. A jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nii cannot know it, only devotees can know it, because devotees can come in close contact with Him and know the secret from Him secretly.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->If one moves towards the emanative point, the point from which all vibrations emanate, one will discover that the starting-point is the Supreme Entity and that one is moving forward as per pulsation of vibrations emanating from that Entity. One finds that the culminating point, of these vibrations is also that Supreme Desideratum, that Parama Purus&#x301;a. That is, the starting point is that Supreme Entity, and the culminating point of these vibrations is also that Supreme Entity. And to the Purus&#x301;a who is the starting-point and who is the Desideratum, to Him I say that He should attach our intellect with the spirit of welfare, with the spirit of shubha. This should be the only prayer for each and every living being.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="33..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The question arises &ndash; is the Supreme Entity, the Supreme Faculty, a singular one or a plural one? The question of plurality in the controlling faculty is a knotty one. The rs&#x301;i says the important law, the Supreme Controlling Faculty, is a singular one &ndash; a singular one. There cannot be any plurality in it. That is, it is singular and shall remain singular forever.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Actually, one day I told you that the proper significance of the term &ldquo;rudra&rdquo; is &ldquo;the entity that makes you shed tears&rdquo;. And I also told you that to shed tears does not always mean lamenting. When you shed tears due to sorrow, when you are aggrieved, tears come out from the inner sides of the eyes straight downwards, and when you shed tears due to pleasure, then they come out from the outer sides. Tears coming out while lamenting is known as &ldquo;shoka&#x301;shru&rdquo;, and tears coming out in pleasure is known as &ldquo;a&#x301;nandashru&rdquo;. When you are in a predicament, having to undergo great troubles, the tears that you shed are due to Him; and when you shed tears in pleasure, it is also due to Rudra. Due to so many clashes and cohesions in this expressed world &ndash; all its attributions &ndash; people shed tears. This world of attribution is a creation of His, so He is the Rudra. Had there been more than one Rudra, the system of the conformity of the universe would have been lost. So Rudra cannot be more than one. That is why I have said, &ldquo;Na dvitiiya&#x301;ya tasthurya.&rdquo; You cannot have any supporter or competitor.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->That Rudra, the Supreme Entity, is the controller of the universe. &ldquo;Iish&rdquo; means &ldquo;to control&rdquo;, and that entity controls this universe with the help of His Operative Principle. That is why in A&#x301;nanda Su&#x301;tram it has been said, &ldquo;Shaktih sa&#x301; Shivasya shaktih&rdquo; &ndash; Shakti is the Operative Principle of the Cognitive Faculty. The Cognitive Faculty does not belong to the Operative Principle, rather, the ownership of the Operative Principle lies with the cognition. Without cognition there cannot be any Operative Principle, but without an Operative Principle there can be the Cognitive Faculty. He controls this universe &ndash; the Supreme Cognitive Faculty controls this universe with the help of His innumerable Operative Principles.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Everything cometh from Him, remaineth in Him and goeth back to Him. He creates, He retains, He destroys. Actually, you know, there will not be any total annihilation and there will not be any thermal death of the universe. But, in a particular portion of the universe or in a particular portion of any planetary system, there can be, there may be, thermal death. In the past there have been so many thermal deaths, and in the future also there will be many thermal deaths, but only in a particular portion of the universe. The universe as a whole will never cease to exist. It will remain forever. So one should not be affected by the scare that the World is coming to an end. There may be death of this small planet earth, but the universe as a whole will never die. Before the death of this earth you or your descendants may quit this earth and go to some other planet of this solar system or any other planet of any other solar system. It is quite possible, quite probable that it may happen like this.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->When complete annihilation takes place in a particular portion of the universe, He remains there, too, and it means that nobody will ever become helpless or hopeless. He remains in contact with the entire creation. This grace of His is known as &ldquo;prota&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->And when He keeps in contact with an individual, as he also does, that relationship, that companionship, is known as &ldquo;ota&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->He is connected with the universe both individually and collectively. His individual relationship is known as &ldquo;ota-yoga&rdquo; and His collective relationship is known as &ldquo;prota-yoga&rdquo;. That is why we say, &ldquo;otah protah yoga&#x301;bhya&#x301;m&#x301; sam&#x301;yuktah purus&#x301;ottamah&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Pratyam&#x301; jana&#x301;m&#x301;stis&#x301;t&#x301;hate saincukopa&#x301;ntaka&#x301;le&rdquo; means the stage of complete annihilation. He is with everyone. So fear not.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Sam&#x301;srjya vishva&#x301; bhuvana&#x301;ni gopa&#x301;h.&rdquo; After creating this universe what did He do? &ldquo;Bhuvanani gopah.&rdquo; He concealed Himself. He concealed Himself just behind His creation. He does not remain in the forefront. He keeps Himself just behind His creation. So in order to find Him we will have to search through His creation. There is no other way. And to find Him, you will have to make a special endeavour, and that special endeavour to find Him is known as &ldquo;sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Therefore, by subjective approach through objective adjustment, you have to attain Him. This is the foremost duty of every human being.<!-- /block --></p>

They are all iishvaras. During the Moghal period, the Moghal Emperors, known as &ldquo;Dilliishvaras&rdquo;, the Lords of Delhi, sometimes used to forget, or rather were at a loss to find, the difference between Dilliishvara and Jagadiishvara, the Lord of the Universe.

But everything is His object so how can you make Him your object? Yes, it is a knotty question, but the reply is very simple. When you meditate on Him, He does not become your object.

<a name="34..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Just now I said that this Supreme Deva functions in all directions. There are ten directions.

Then there are the sub-directions: isha&#x301;n, naerta, agni, va&#x301;yu &ndash; north-east, north-west, south-east and south-west. These four sub-directions are called &ldquo;anudisha&rdquo;. Now east, west, north, south, up and down, the six lateral directions, are known as &ldquo;pradisha&rdquo; in Sam&#x301;skrta. Six pradisha plus four anudisha &ndash; six plus four is equal to ten.

That is, the entity that helps you in moving towards your goal, in moving towards the Nucleus of the Cosmos, is called &ldquo;Pran&#x301;ava&rdquo;. &ldquo;Pran&#x301;ava&rdquo; means &ldquo;movement&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Sarve Veda&rdquo; means &ldquo;all the Vedas&rdquo;. What is the meaning of &ldquo;sarve&rdquo;? &ldquo;Sarvah&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;sarvao&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;sarve&rdquo;. &ldquo;Sarva&rdquo; means &ldquo;everything&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->In &ldquo;sarva&rdquo;, there are three letters, &ldquo;sa&rdquo;, &ldquo;ra&rdquo; and &ldquo;va&rdquo;. &ldquo;Sa&rdquo; represents the sentient principle. Why is the letter &ldquo;sa&rdquo; the first letter in this word? When the first flow of creation emanates from Consciousness, from Cognition, the starting-point is certainly the sentient factor. That is why &ldquo;sa&rdquo; is the first letter.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Then &ldquo;ra&rdquo;. Whatever has been created, or whatever is in the process of creation, must have movement in it. There must be speed, and not only speed, there must be velocity also. And this speed comes from energy. Without energy there cannot be any speed. &ldquo;Ra&rdquo; is the acoustic root of energy. That is why &ldquo;ra&rdquo; is the second letter.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->And &ldquo;va&rdquo; is the third and last letter. The letter &ldquo;va&rdquo; is the acoustic root of characteristics, properties. Each and every entity, each and every created being in this world, has subtle characteristics of its own. These are the properties, these are the svabhava. There is no entity in the world that has no svabhava. For properties, for characteristics, the acoustic root is &ldquo;va&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Now, everything that exists in the world comes from the sentient principle of the Cosmic Cognitive Faculty. Hence, the starting point is &ldquo;sa&rdquo;. Everything moves with the help of energy. So there is &ldquo;ra&rdquo;. And everything has some property, so there is &ldquo;va&rdquo;. &ldquo;Sa&rdquo;, &ldquo;ra&rdquo; and &ldquo;va&rdquo; &ndash; these three letters are present in each and every expression, and that is why &ldquo;sarva&rdquo; means &ldquo;everything&rdquo;. Nothing can remain outside the periphery of sa-ra-va.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->The &ldquo;rk&rdquo; of the Rk Veda means &ldquo;to know&rdquo;. &ldquo;Veda&rdquo; also means knowledge. &ldquo;Sarve Veda&rdquo; means &ldquo;all knowledge&rdquo;. &ldquo;Knowledge&rdquo; here means spiritual knowledge. &ldquo;Knowledge&rdquo; means supra-psychic knowledge. Psychic and physical knowledges are not true knowledges in the proper sense of the term, because they vary according to variation in time, space and person. They are not absolute entities.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Berlin was the capital of Germany&rdquo;. &ldquo;No, no, no, Bonn is the capital of Germany&rdquo;. Both are equally correct, only there has been a temporal gap, a gap of time.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Tapah&rdquo; means undergoing pains, troubles, predicaments, tortures for the purpose of attaining the goal. It is called &ldquo;tapasya&#x301;&rdquo;. Those munis, those rs&#x301;is, those spiritual aspirants who undergo tapah, who expose themselves to tapah to attain their Supreme Desideratum, undergo such troubles, for what reason? To attain that very Entity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Icchantum&rdquo; means &ldquo;desiring the spiritual&rdquo;. People who want to establish themselves in supra-psychic strata are icchantu. They are spiritual aspirants &ndash; those who want Him, those who have accepted Him as their only subjective counterpart in the physical stratum.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->I told you the other day that He is the Supreme Subjectivity and others are the objects. He cannot be your object. This is philosophically and psychologically correct. But during your meditation, what do you do? What should you do? He cannot be your object; He is the subject, He is everything. He sees you, because He is the subject, you are the object. But if you are thinking of Him, then He becomes Your object. How can He become Your Object? It is an impossibility. To resolve this, I told you that as you do meditation, with the help of Your incantation, you should think that He is seeing You. That is the secret.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Brahmacaryain&#x32D;caranti&rdquo; &ndash; What is &ldquo;brahmacaryam&rdquo;? In Sam&#x301;skrta, there are many root verbs for &ldquo;movement&rdquo;. One word is &ldquo;calati&rdquo;. &ldquo;Calati&rdquo; is a general term that means moving, walking, going. Another word is &ldquo;carati&rdquo;. &ldquo;Carati&rdquo; means &ldquo;moving while eating&rdquo;. You are moving, at the same time you are eating &ndash; like a cow, &ldquo;carati&rdquo;, because she is also eating. And when you move along the road while eating peanuts, you are also &ldquo;carati&rdquo;, because you are moving and eating peanuts (you know, groundnuts, &ldquo;chiniya&#x301; ba&#x301;da&#x301;m&rdquo; in Bihar, &ldquo;mugphalii&rdquo; in Hindi). If you eat while moving, then at that time you are just like a cow.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Then &ldquo;at&#x301;ati&rdquo;. &ldquo;At&#x301;ati&rdquo; is also movement, but while moving or touring, one is also learning something. So &ldquo;at&#x301;ati&rdquo; means &ldquo;moving while learning&rdquo;. Not ordinary moving like &ldquo;carat&#x301;i&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Then there is &ldquo;vrajati&rdquo; &ndash; moving while enjoying something Moving while enjoying pleasure, while enjoying bliss, is vrajati. Moving towards Him is vrajati &ndash; The person is getting pleasure while moving. See, there are so many verbs.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Brahmacaryam&rdquo; &ndash; that is &ldquo;moving in Brahma while eating&rdquo;. What sort of eating? The person is getting all sorts of physical, psychic and supra-psychic pabula from the Cosmic Body of Brahma. Thus he who is moving in Brahma with the help of his second lesson, guru mantra, is brahmaca&#x301;rii. He always remembers the fact that all his movements are within the Cosmic Body of Brahma.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Acquire that rank, come in close proximity to that rank, I say. &ldquo;Aum&rdquo; is the controlling word. There are three sounds in it. You know, in the Indo-Aryan alphabetical chart there are fifty letters: sixteen vowels and thirty-four consonants. Each and every sound of this alphabetical order, of this Indo-Aryan alphabetical order, is an acoustic root of a cosmic manifestation. So there are fifty controlling acoustic roots, and by the process of permutation and combination, a large number of acoustic roots of complex and complicated character may be created. (You all know permutation and combination and you know mathematics.) And this controlling letter, as I said, is called &ldquo;pran&#x301;ava&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->The rs&#x301;i says the three controlling letters are &ldquo;a&rdquo;, &ldquo;u&rdquo; and &ldquo;ma&rdquo;. &ldquo;A&rdquo; is the acoustic root of creation. Hence &ldquo;a&rdquo; is the first letter of the Indo-Aryan alphabetical order.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->Each and every vibration of the universe has a colour. That colour may or may not be visible. And there is certainly some sound. That sound may or may not be audible, but the sound is there. It may or may not come within the scope of our particular nerves. We may or may not hear it, but the sound is there. So action and expression must have some sound, and the sound of creation is &ldquo;a&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Why is &ldquo;a&rdquo; the first letter and why not &ldquo;a&#x301;&rdquo;? Because &ldquo;a&rdquo; is the acoustic root of creation. In the Roman script, &ldquo;a&rdquo;. The pronunciation is &ldquo;a&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;alpha&rdquo;, &ldquo;aleph&rdquo;, same letter. And it is the acoustic root of creation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->And after creating something, you are to maintain it. You are to nourish it, you are to serve it, you are to feed it, you are to supply it with all necessary pabula. And this process of maintenance is represented by the acoustic root &ldquo;u&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->When you create something in your mind, you are retaining it for a short while, then you are withdrawing it within your mind; you take it back within your mind. Similarly, He creates something and after some time He withdraws it. This process of withdrawal is represented by the acoustic root &ldquo;ma&rdquo;. For a mortal, this withdrawal is death, but for Him it is a simple process of withdrawal and nothing else. This process of withdrawal by Him is represented by the acoustic root &ldquo;ma&rdquo;, and that is why that day I told you, &ldquo;ma&rdquo; is the last letter, last consonant.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->That is why it is &ldquo;a&rdquo; + &ldquo;u&rdquo; + &ldquo;ma&rdquo; = &ldquo;aum&rdquo;. That day I told you that &ldquo;a&rdquo; is the acoustic root of the generating faculty, &ldquo;u&rdquo; is the acoustic root of the retaining faculty, and &ldquo;ma&rdquo; is the acoustic root of the destroying faculty. Therefore He has three functions. He becomes G-O-D, that is, &ldquo;Generator&#146;s&rdquo; first letter G; &ldquo;Operator&#146;s&rdquo; first letter O; and &ldquo;Destroyer&#146;s&rdquo; first letter D: &ldquo;God&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>

But when spiritual thirst develops, these people become viira, heroic. And when they are firmly established in viirabha&#x301;va, they become devata&#x301;s.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->As a created being, everybody in the universe by birth is a pashu, an animal. But the standard of beings is to be exalted towards divinity, towards godliness. A pashu, that is, an animal, becomes man, man becomes god. This process, the process of exaltation, the process of upliftment, from animality to godliness, is your sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->In Sanskrit it is also said that<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36..6"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Janmana&#x301; ja&#x301;yate shu&#x301;dra sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ra&#x301;t dvija ucyate;<br>Vedapa&#x301;t&#x301;he bhavet vipra Brahma ja&#x301;na&#x301;ti Bra&#x301;hman&#x301;ah.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36..7"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;By birth, everybody is a shu&#x301;dra.&rdquo; (Shu&#x301;dra means &ldquo;having all the wonts of animality&rdquo;.) &ldquo;And  when one gets initiation, that is, Vaedikii diiks&#x301;a&#x301; &ndash; that is, when one learns how to pray, how to express one&#146;s desire to become human &ndash; the person is known as a dvija.&rdquo; (Dvija means &ldquo;second birth&rdquo;. That is, the person is no longer an animal.) &ldquo;And then after going through scriptures, acquiring proper spiritual knowledge, the person is known as a vipra. And after getting Ta&#x301;ntrikii diiks&#x301;a&#x301;, that is, psycho-spiritual initiation, initiation in the realm of psycho-spirituality, the person becomes a Bra&#x301;hman&#x301;a.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Now the question is, have these pashus, these animals, these brutes, no future? Certainly they have. Because the Supreme Progenitor is with everybody, and He is with these animals-in-human-form also. And a pashu whose object of adoration, that is, whose goal of life, is that very Parama Purus&#x301;a, will address Him as &ndash; what? As &ldquo;Pashupati&rdquo; [&ldquo;Lord of Animals&rdquo;]. &ldquo;O Lord, O Parama Purus&#x301;a, we are pashus, we are animals, and Thou art Lord of the animals, Thou art &lsquo;Pashupati.&rsquo;&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->So one of the names of Parama Purus&#x301;a is Pashupati. For sleeping humanity, the Supreme Consciousness, Supreme Entity, is Pashupati.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Tes&#x301;a&#x301;m&#x301; jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na praka&#x301;sha&#x301;ya viirabha&#x301;va praka&#x301;shitah &ndash; &ldquo;And when they feel, when they realize, when they understand, what to do and what not to do, what are the dos of life and what are the don&#146;ts of life, then they become bold.&rdquo; Why bold? They are to fight against all sorts of adversities, all sorts of troubles, all sorts of inimical attitudes. So they are certainly heroes; and a hero in Sanskrit is called a viira. So at that stage of humanity when this viirabha&#x301;va develops, when a person becomes ready to fight against all opposite forces, he is a viira. In Tantra this is called viirabha&#x301;va, and for him, the Supreme Entity is &ldquo;Viireshvara&rdquo;. The man becomes viira, and his Lord becomes Viireshvara &ndash; no longer Pashupati, but Viireshvara. One of the names of Parama Purus&#x301;a is Viireshvara.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->When the person is fully established in viirabha&#x301;va &ndash; that is, he is never to be frightened, never to be defeated, never to accept any defeat (you girls should remember that here &ldquo;he&rdquo; means &ldquo;she&rdquo; also) &ndash; then he is established in viirabhava. And that bha&#x301;va is called divyabha&#x301;va. And that man is no longer known as viira. He is a deva, or devata&#x301;. Kramen&#x301;a devata&#x301; bhavet. &ldquo;He becomes devata&#x301;, he becomes deva in human structure, deva in human framework.&rdquo; That stage is divyabha&#x301;va. Then that person&#146;s goal, his object of adoration, becomes &ldquo;Maha&#x301;deva&rdquo;, not Viireshvara but Maha&#x301;deva.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->In the first phase the Lord was Pashupati, in the second phase Viireshvara, and in the final phase Maha&#x301;deva. So the same Lord, according to one&#146;s own psycho-spiritual stratum, is to be addressed sometimes as Pashupati, sometimes as Viireshvara, and sometimes as Maha&#x301;deva. Now, I have said that a person has three types of expression: One expression is thinking, the thinking faculty, and the second one is speaking&#8230; In the first the function is within the nerve cells, and in the second, the function is &ndash; where? With the lips. And the third action is action with the physical body, corporal action.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Now in the case of pashus, that is, animals in human structure, the thought-waves move like this&#8230; and the lips speak like this&#8230; and the actions are like that! There is no adjustment amongst these three expressions. The person is a pashu, the person is in the stage of pashu, in the stage of animality, although the structure is like that of a human. In the society these people are in the majority, and others are in a hopeless minority; and I want you boys and you girls to try your best to decrease the number of these pashus.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->And in the second phase, that is, in the viira stage, the thought-waves move like that&#8230; but the words and the actions are one. That is, there are some differences between thoughts on the one hand, and words and actions on the other hand, but the words and the actions are the same. What these people say, they do. In society, these people, these people of viirabha&#x301;va, are respected as great men, as Maha&#x301;purus&#x301;as, as leaders of society, as leaders of the country. But there is a defect in them also, because their thoughts and their actions are not the same. Their actions and words are the same, but their thoughts are not the same. Do you follow? They are [in] viirabha&#x301;va, they are viira; their Lord is Viireshvara.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->And in the final stage, that is, when one attains the stage of devata&#x301;, then what one thinks, one says; and what one says, one does. There is no difference amongst thinking, saying, and doing. And that is the best stage of human structure or human existence.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->You should all try to be like this, and I want the number of such persons, who have attained the stratum of devata&#x301;, to increase. And you have become workers, or wholetimers, just to increase the number of these devata&#x301;s in human society.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="37..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The path of spirituality is beyond the scope of symbolization. The supra-mental or supra-psychic existence of Parama Purus&#x301;a is beyond the territory of our minds. And the feeling of our minds cannot be properly expressed by our motor organs. So our mind is an imperfect medium for conceiving the actualities of supra-psychic existence; and for conveying momentary feelings, our motor organs are imperfect media. All your feelings cannot be expressed through the vocal organ or any other organ; for a small trouble your say, &ldquo;Uph!&rdquo; and for a very big trouble also you say, &ldquo;Uph!&rdquo; It is very difficult for you and also for others to differentiate the first &ldquo;Uph!&rdquo; from the second one. They do not express the same gravity, the same feeling.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Now, when our minds and the motor and the sensory organs fail to express certain psychic feelings, or express them only partially, then how can the mind express or symbolize the Supreme Self? It is impossible. Still, we call that supra-psychic-existential Entity &ldquo;Parama Purus&#x301;a&rdquo;. This is also a symbolization.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The meaning or inner spirit of this form of symbolization is that when we call Him &ldquo;Parama Purus&#x301;a&rdquo; we say, &ldquo;O Parama Purus&#x301;a, we call You that in order to express our inability to symbolize You.&rdquo; Therefore to know Him you have to go beyond the periphery of your whole relative structure and finally attain unity with Him. This alone will be the supreme expression of all human sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
