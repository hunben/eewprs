<a name="2..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The series of discourses that comprise the present volume were transcribed from talks given by the author over a period of time that extended from June to November of 1983. The title given by the author was Varn&#x301;a Vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;na, which translates into English as &ldquo;The Science of Letters&rdquo;. However it could just as easily be rendered as &ldquo;The Science of Language&rdquo;, for in it the author binds the myriad and often mystifying threads of language into a single tapestry and demonstrates with remarkable clarity how they obey the laws of pure science. In a lucid and entertaining style, laced with anecdotes and stories, he uncovers the fundamental principles which govern linguistic expression and blends this with an historical perspective that throws new light on the origins of human language. Many of the ideas that inform these discourses are new to the study of linguistics and are sure to provide ample material for future research.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->While Varn&#x301;a Vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;na takes the Bengali language as its initial point of reference, it ranges far and wide across a landscape that includes most of world&#146;s major languages. Time and again the author points out the common factors at work in seemingly disparate idioms. In this way he uses linguistic science to demolish some of the barriers that separate different communities and races.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Those readers who are interested in delving further into the author&#146;s studies in language will be glad to know that they have ample material to choose from. After completing Varn&#x301;a Vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;na, the author embarked upon an eight volume series called Varn&#x301;a Vicitra&#x301;, &ldquo;Various Uses of Letters&rdquo; and after that a twenty-six volume series entitled Shabda Cayanika&#x301;, &ldquo;A Collection of Words&rdquo;. Together they comprise a body of work that is unsurpassed in the field of linguistic studies.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Footnotes by the translator have been signed &ldquo;&ndash;Trans.&rdquo;. Unsigned footnotes are those of the author.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Square brackets [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;] in the text are used to indicate translations by the translator or other editorial insertions. Round brackets (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) indicate a word or words originally given by the author.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->The author uses a certain shorthand for explaining etymologies of words. Under this system, a minus sign (&ndash;) follows a prefix, and a plus sign (+) precedes a suffix. Thus ava &ndash; tr + ghain&#x32D; = avata&#x301;ra can be read, &ldquo;the root tr prefixed by ava and suffixed by ghain&#x32D; becomes avata&#x301;ra.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Finally I would like to call attention to the invaluable contribution of A&#x301;ca&#x301;rya Vijaya&#x301;nanda Avadhu&#x301;ta, without which this translation could not have been completed. He compared the English text line by line with the original Bengali, making corrections wherever necessary, and also provided translations for the Sanskrit verses.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="3..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->All the languages of the world are bound together on a single thread &ndash; su&#x301;tre man&#x301;igan&#x301;a&#x301; iva. No language is beyond this law. Those languages which used to carry the remnants of natural melodies have also finally had to obey this law. Even before the existence of written script the science of language was based on phonetics. Despite the lack of script, alphabetical order did exist. For example, during the Rgvedic era the letters ka, kha, ga, gha existed but people did not know how to write them. The people of that time were not familiar with the letters of the alphabet &ndash; they knew their pronunciation but they could not write them. At that time metrics were fixed according to alphabetical order.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Written script did not exist at the beginning of the Vedic era. Written script came into existence between five and six thousand years ago with the Saendhavii script. Although written script did not exist in the Vedic era, metre did. There are seven metres in the Vedas: Us&#x301;n&#x301;ik, Ga&#x301;yatrii, Anus&#x301;t&#x301;up, Tris&#x301;t&#x301;up, Brhatii, Jagatii and Paunkti. There were special rules for the pronunciation of Us&#x301;n&#x301;ik metre.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The Vedic language is the oldest language that we are familiar with. This language was influential in central Asia and certain parts of India for a period that extended from fifteen thousand years ago to about seven and a half thousand years ago. Its alphabetical order follows the rules of Rgvedic pronunciation. There are three accepted systems of pronunciation in Sanskrit &ndash; Sam&#x301;vrta, Vivrta and Tiryyak. Both Sanskrit and Vedic have three measures of pronunciation &ndash; short, long and extended.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->In Sanskrit there are four accepted systems of pronunciation &ndash; Ka&#x301;shika&#x301;, Daks&#x301;in&#x301;ii, Maha&#x301;ra&#x301;s&#x301;t&#x301;rii and Gaor&#x301;iiya [those of Benares, southern India, Maharashtra and Bengal]. The Rgvedic style of pronunciation is different from the Yajurvedic style of pronunciation. In Sam&#x301;vrta the pronunciation of the alphabet is similar to Bengali pronunciation. In Vivrta it is somewhat similar to that of the western areas of Uttar Pradesh. Tiryyak occupies a place somewhere between the English &ldquo;au&rdquo; and the English &ldquo;o&rdquo;. For example, we write man but we pronounce it somewhere in-between &ldquo;maun&rdquo; and &ldquo;mone&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The Rgvedic style has a total of fifty letters &ndash; sixteen vowels and thirty-four consonants. The sixteen vowels are: a, a&#x301;, i, ii, u, u&#x301;, r, rr, lr, lrr, e, ae, o, ao, am&#x301;, and ah. The thirty-four consonants are: ka, kha, ga, gha, un&#x32D;a, ca, cha, ja, jha, in&#x32D;a, t&#x301;a, t&#x301;ha, d&#x301;a, d&#x301;ha, n&#x301;a, ta, tha, da, dha, na, pa, pha, ba, bha, ma, ya, ra, la, va, sha, s&#x301;a, sa, ha, and ks&#x301;a. D&#x301;a and d&#x301;ha are pronounced in two different ways. The letter d&#x301;a is pronounced d&#x301;a at the beginning of a word, for example, d&#x301;ambaru. However it is pronounced r&#x301;a (rha) in the middle or at the end of a word, as in a&#x301;r&#x301;ambara. Similarly, d&#x301;ha is pronounced d&#x301;ha at the beginning of a word, for example, d&#x301;hakka&#x301;, and r&#x301;ha (rhha) in the middle or at the end of a word, as in a&#x301;s&#x301;a&#x301;r&#x301;ha.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->There is a fixed rule for the pronunciation of ya &ndash; pada&#x301;nte padamadhyasthe &ldquo;ya&rdquo;-ka&#x301;ra &ldquo;ia&rdquo; ucyate. If ya occurs at the beginning of a word then it is pronounced like a light &ldquo;ja&rdquo; as in yoga, yadu, yamuna&#x301;, but if it comes in the middle or at the end of a word then it is pronounced &ldquo;ia&rdquo;, as in viyoga or samaya. Some pandits in northern India mistakenly pronounce the word yoga &ldquo;iog&rdquo;. Ishwarchandra Vidyasagar Mahashay placed a dot beneath the letters d&#x301;a, d&#x301;ha and ya in his grade school primer, Varn&#x301;a Paricaya, whenever they occurred in the middle or end of a word so that children would not make this sort of mistake.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->A language normally lasts about one thousand years and a script about two thousand years before undergoing metamorphosis. Script, however, is not sound. It is alphabetical order. The Bengali script came into existence approximately fifteen hundred years ago and it will survive for some time longer. Due to the invention of printing, the life of the script will be extended somewhat.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->An old form of Bengali script has been discovered in Singbhum District&#146;s Jayda village on the banks of the Suvarnarekha River. A deed of gift written in the script of that time has been found in the Shushuniya<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.3.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#3.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> Hills in Bankura District&#146;s Chatna Thana.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.3.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#3.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  These are the two oldest extant examples of Bengali script.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->The Pra&#x301;krta language came into existence approximately thirty-five hundred years ago and when it did Sanskrit or Vedic pronunciation changed. To put it in another way, the name of those altered verbal root forms, word forms, pronouns and vocabulary was Pra&#x301;krta, which spread orally among the common people. Pra&#x301;krta came into existence shortly before the advent of Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Many people believe that Sanskrit is an artificial language. However, the prevalence of so many Sanskrit words in the speech of uneducated people proves that it is not. For example, kandara is a Sanskrit word. In the colloquial language of Rarh there is a word ka&#x301;ndar, that is, a small, deep tributary. If Sanskrit were an artificial language then how could there be so many Sanskrit words in use among uneducated people. The people of Rarh have Sanskrit in their blood. It is their native language. If Bengali is the language of our veins and arteries then Sanskrit is the language of our bone marrow.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->The use of r, rr, lr, and lrr is not as widespread in the Yajurveda as it is in the Rgveda. They are also pronounced completely differently. In the Rgveda these letters are pronounced r, rr, lr, and lrr while in the Yajurveda they are pronounced ri, rri, lri, and lrri. In the Atharvaveda they are pronounced ru, rru, lru, and lrru. Modern Bengali has retained the use of r. Adding i to ra can serve the same function as r, but because these two letters can give rise to inversions in the case of certain conjuncts the letter r is used. For example, deva + rs&#x301;i = devars&#x301;i. If it is written deva + ris&#x301;i then the conjunct cannot be formed.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Modern Indian languages do not follow any specific Vedic rules. Bengali only has the sha pronunciation &ndash; s&#x301;a and sa are not pronounced differently &ndash; while some other languages only have the sa pronunciation. For example, shuye par&#x301;a in Bengali is so ja&#x301;o in Hindi. The rules for Sanskrit-derived words in Bengali follow those for Sanskrit-borrowed words. For this reason, the letters s&#x301;a and sa are used for spelling purposes but no Bengali teacher ever makes a distinction among the pronunciation of sha, s&#x301;a and sa.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="4..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Phonetics is a completely scientific subject. In the world of action not a single step can be taken without science. Here it will have to be borne in mind that the application of science changes according to the changes in time, place and person. Both place and person can change at the same time. For example, the Vedic ks&#x301;a (k-s&#x301;a) becomes ks&#x301;a (k-cha) with a change in person. Kutsa&#x301; becomes keccha&#x301;. This altered pronunciation takes place in accordance with differences in individual body structure, changes in blood and climatic changes. The spoken language of northern Chittagong is pure Bengali; there is no foreign influence over its style of pronunciation. However, since south Chittagong&#146;s Cox&#146;s Bazar lies near Burma, it has been influenced by Burmese pronunciation, especially in the areas near Teknap. As a result, the pronunciation has become non-Vedic despite the fact that from the linguistic point of view it is pure Bengali.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The same thing has happened with Assamese. Although by and large Assamese follows the Yajurvedic style of pronunciation, some altered pronunciation has crept in. The reason for this is that when the people of the Ahom tribes migrated from Burma they brought with them that country&#146;s style of pronunciation and that influenced the local phonetics. For example, in Assamese the pronunciation of ca has become like that of sa. The pronunciation of the t&#x301;a varga is similar to that of the ta varga and there is a mutual interchange that occurs between these two vargas.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.4.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#4.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> For example, kut&#x301;il becomes somewhat similar to kutil. This is due to the influence of different clans. There is not a single trace of Burmese influence in the pronunciation of Rangpuri Bengali in nearby northern Bengal.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The pronunciation of the Rarh area corresponds to that of the rest of northern India. It corresponds to that of Oriya except where the Oriya pronunciation style follows the Atharvavedic or Rgvedic pronunciation. For example, the pronunciation of phala [fruit] in Oriya is phar&#x301;a. In Oriya&#146;s Rgvedic style of pronunciation there is a difference between the pronunciation of a&#x301;di la [la at the beginning of a word] and antahstha la [la in the middle or end of a word], but in the rest of northern India they are pronounced the same.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.4.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#4.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> Although there is a difference between a&#x301;di la and antahstha la in the spoken language in some parts of Bihar, Rajasthan and other areas, there is no difference in the written language. In some areas in Bihar kala&#x301; [banana] is called kera&#x301;, ga&#x301;li [abuse] is pronounced ga&#x301;ri, and kapa&#x301;l [forehead] is pronounced kapa&#x301;r&#x301;. In Oriya, Gujarati and the south Indian languages antahstha la is both pronounced differently and used differently, and for this reason there are separate forms as well. However, in Bengali they are written and pronounced the same.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->In Sanskrit phonetics the letters are systematically arranged. There are fourteen pure vowels &ndash; a, a&#x301;, i, ii, u, u&#x301;, r, rr, lr, lrr, e, ae, o, ao &ndash; and two demi-vowels &ndash; am&#x301; and ah. In the Rgveda there is also a long anusva&#x301;ra (<img src="../../HTML/Images/AncientAnusvara.PNG">) that no longer exists in modern Sanskrit. Now the question is, why this demi-vowel?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->A vowel can be pronounced without any additional help, but in the case of am&#x301; and ah, the m&#x301; and the h cannot be pronounced by themselves. Since they cannot be pronounced alone they are called demi-vowels, that is, they are vowels but not full vowels. Thus they are called ayogava&#x301;ha in Sanskrit, that is, these two vowels cannot be pronounced without another&#146;s help. A thousand years ago the visarga (h) existed in Bengali and also in Maethilii; however at that time it was written like the Bengali symbol for &ldquo;four&rdquo; (<span class=Bengali>&#x09EA;</span>).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Among the thirty-four consonants, those belonging to the vargas &ndash; ka, kha, ga, gha, un&#x32D;a, ca, cha, ja, jha, in&#x32D;a, t&#x301;a, t&#x301;ha, d&#x301;a, d&#x301;ha, n&#x301;a, ta, tha, da, dha, na, pa, pha, ba, bha, ma &ndash; are pure consonants. Sha, sa, s&#x301;a, ha and ks&#x301;a are called us&#x301;mavarn&#x301;a [aspirates]. When they are pronounced they create heat in the vocal cavity.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.4.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#4.fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> They are consonants but not pure consonants. Ya, ra, la and va are antahsthavarn&#x301;a. They are also not pure consonants. They are pronounced one way at the beginning of a word and another way in the middle or at the end of a word. Ya at the beginning of a word is pronounced like a light &ldquo;ja&rdquo; [as in &ldquo;Germany&rdquo;], for example, yadu, yadi, ya&#x301;ga-yajin&#x32D;a. In the middle or at the end of a word it is pronounced ia. Incidentally, it is worth mentioning that ja is a hard &ldquo;ja&rdquo; sound (palatal), for example, janttu-ja&#x301;nowa&#x301;r.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->In Bengali vargiiya ja (hard or palatal) is used in two ways. First, wherever hard ja is used in a Sanskrit word it is retained in Bengali, for example, jat&#x301;hara, janttu, etc. Second, wherever the hard da in Sanskrit has become transformed into hard ja in Pra&#x301;krta (vargiiya ja or palatal ja). For example, adya &rarr; ajja &rarr; a&#x301;j; duhita&#x301; &rarr; juhia&#x301; &rarr; jhia&#x301; &rarr; jhia &rarr; jhi. This change, that is, the passage of these words from Sanskrit to Bengali, took five thousand years. The change went through three phases, from Pra&#x301;krta to Demi-Pra&#x301;krta to old Bengali. Such a transformation will always have the hard ja, for example, duhita&#x301;. Here there is force applied to the du. In Sanskrit the word duhitr is derived by adding the suffix trn&#x301; to the verbal root duh &ndash; in Latin, duhitar; in modern English, &ldquo;daughter&rdquo;. Since the word duhitr contains the letter ha, the English &ldquo;daughter&rdquo; is also spelled with an &ldquo;h&rdquo;, however over time its pronunciation has been lost. From this it can clearly deduced that both English and Sanskrit are Vedic languages, hence the many similarities between the two. For example, the word &ldquo;night&rdquo; is naktram&#x301; in Vedic and [[noctum]] in old Latin. The Latin adjective is &ldquo;nocturnal&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Thus we see that at the beginning of a word ya is pronounced like a light ja, and in the middle or at the end of a word its pronunciation becomes ia. There is less influence of Sanskrit in north India by comparison due to the predominance of Urdu; thus this rule is not followed in Hindi. For example, iaha&#x301;n is written yaha&#x301;n although, according to the rule, if we write yaha&#x301;n it is not correct to pronounce it iaha&#x301;n.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->The next letter is ra. When ra comes at the beginning of a word it is pronounced ra. It is pronounced this way when the tongue touches the teeth of the upper palate. One example is ran&#x301;a. If ra is in the middle or at the end of a word it is pronounced without touching the tongue to the teeth of the upper palate, for example, caran&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Then comes la. If la is at the beginning of a word it is called a&#x301;di la.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.4.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#4.fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> For example, la in lata&#x301; is pronounced la. If la occurs in the middle or at the end of a word it is pronounced lra. For example, the correct pronunciation of the word phala is phalra (phalram, phalre, phalra&#x301;ni). This rule is not followed in northern India; thus the Sanskrit pandits there pronounce it incorrectly. In Rajasthan goli is pronounced gori. In  Bhojpuri kapa&#x301;l is pronounced kapa&#x301;r&#x301; and diwa&#x301;l is diwa&#x301;r&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Next comes antahstha va. In Bengali, antahstha va and vargiiya ba are written and pronounced the same. At the beginning of a word antahstha va is pronounced like the English &ldquo;va&rdquo;, as in the pronunciation of &ldquo;van&rdquo; and &ldquo;caravan&rdquo;. That is, it is pronounced by filling the mouth with air, closing it, and then thrusting the lower and upper lips out. In the middle or at the end of a word antahstha va is pronounced like the English &ldquo;wa&rdquo;. This is also the case when va is the second part of a conjunct, for example, vidva&#x301;na. In northern India, antahstha va is mistakenly pronounced &ldquo;wa&rdquo; at all times.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Thus these four letters &ndash; ya, ra, la and va &ndash; are antahsthavarn&#x301;a rather than pure consonants. Why? Because in fact they are each a diphthong of two vowels. Specifically, ya = i + a, ra = r + a, la = lr + a, and va = o + a. They are mistakenly taken to be consonants but they are actually not consonants.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="5..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Earlier I said that the letters included within the five vargas &ndash; ka, ca, t&#x301;a, ta, and pa &ndash; are pure consonants. The remaining consonants are not pure consonants. I also pointed out that sa, sha, s&#x301;a, ha, and ks&#x301;a are not pure consonants because they are pronounced with a whistle. They are whistled aspirates (us&#x301;mavarn&#x301;a). At the time of pronunciation they produce some slight heat in the lips and tongue. Ya, ra, la, and va are also not pure consonants because they are diphthongs of multiple vowels. These kinds of diphthongs were prevalent in old English, for example &ldquo;Caesar&rdquo;, but not in modern English.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->In Bengali both hard ja and light ya are used. Ya is a diphthong composed of i and a. Hard ja is pronounced by touching the tongue to the upper palate while light ya is pronounced by thrusting the tongue towards the teeth&#146;s lower gum.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Earlier I said that when ra is at the beginning of a word it is called a&#x301;di ra, as in ran&#x301;a. It is pronounced by touching the tongue to the teeth of the upper palate. If it occurs in the middle or at the end of a word then it is pronounced as a light ra without the tongue touching the teeth of the upper palate, as in caran&#x301;a. Unfortunately, some Sanskrit pandits overlook this speciality of ra&#x301;s pronunciation. I hope they will pay sufficient attention to this.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Now as for la, it is called a&#x301;di la when it comes at the beginning of a word and its pronunciation is a straightforward la sound, as in lata&#x301;. When it is in the middle or at the end of a word then its pronunciation changes. The Rgvedic pronunciation becomes lra, the Yajurvedic pronunciation becomes lri, and the Atharvavedic pronunciation becomes lru.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The addition of the vowel a to long r (rr) or to long lr (lrr) does not create an antahsthavarn&#x301;a. In the Rgveda the pronunciation of rr and lrr respectively are rr and lrr and in the Yajurveda they are rri and lrri. In the Atharvaveda they are rru and lrru, however, they are, for all intents and purposes, non-existent in the Atharvaveda. Both Panini and Vopadeva [famous Sanskrit grammarians] use them infrequently. In their opinion there is not much need for them. The Vedas only have a few words that contain lrr. Afterwards it disappeared. However, rr continues to be used to a small extent. Lr was also used here and there about twelve or thirteen hundred years ago. Now it has completely disappeared.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Primary school children are mistakenly taught lr for licu. Now the vowel lr is pronounced lri, not li, but the fruit&#146;s name is licu, not lricu. There is a small anecdote about the naming of the licu fruit. Two Chinese horticulturists, Mr. Pi Si and Mr. Li Chi, were conducting research on wild fruits to improve them. The high quality fruit that Mr. Pi Si developed was named &ldquo;peach&rdquo; (in Hindi, sa&#x301;ta&#x301;lu) after the associated researcher, and the fruit that Mr. Li Chi developed was given his name, &ldquo;litchi&rdquo;. Mr. Li Chi&#146;s father&#146;s name was Fi Chu. Many people felt that since the father&#146;s name was Fi Chu then the son&#146;s name should have been Li Chu. Thus the fruit is called licu in some parts of China and in Bengal.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->In the Rgveda there is a difference between the pronunciation of the short anusva&#x301;ra, the long anusva&#x301;ra and the extended anusva&#x301;ra. However, a separate letter was not used for the extended anusva&#x301;ra when the Vedas were written down later on, though there were separate letters for the short and long anusva&#x301;ra. Its pronunciation had to be learned by ear.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Next comes antahstha va. At the beginning of a word it is pronounced like the English &ldquo;va&rdquo;, as in &ldquo;van&rdquo;. The word vis&#x301;n&#x301;u is pronounced with this &ldquo;va&rdquo;. In the middle or at the end of a word it is pronounced like &ldquo;wa&rdquo;. Vidva&#x301;n, for example, becomes &ldquo;vidwan&rdquo;; dva&#x301;dashii becomes &ldquo;dwadashii&rdquo;, and so on. In Calcutta these two words are pronounced vidda&#x301;n and da&#x301;dashii respectively. In Bengali the pronunciation of Calcutta is accepted as standard pronunciation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->When a conjunct has va, ya or ma as the second letter then the word is pronounced as if that letter were not there, and the pronunciation of the letter to which it is attached is doubled. For example, vidva&#x301;n = vidda&#x301;n, padma&#x301; = padda&#x301;, vidya&#x301; = vidda&#x301;, and so on. Only in Rarh, especially in Burdwan, are there exceptions to this. For example, not long ago Laks&#x301;mii used to be pronounced &ldquo;Lachmii&rdquo;. Sva&#x301;mii is still pronounced &ldquo;swami&rdquo; and dva&#x301;dashii, &ldquo;dwadashii&rdquo;; jya&#x301;nta is pronounced jiia&#x301;nta.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->According to the rules of Sanskrit grammar, if a ref is placed above a letter (<span class=Bengali>&#x09F4;</span>) then the spelling of the concerned letter can be doubled as an alternative, for example, dharma, dharmma; karma, karmma; etc. Fifty years ago this doubled spelling was still very much in evidence. The spelling dharmma used to be common.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Another rule that used to be in force was that whenever a ref was added to an aspirated letter then at the time of pronunciation it would be placed above the corresponding non-aspirated letter, for example, arddha, garbbha, and so on.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->According to Sanskrit grammar, if there is a doubled letter in a root word then the doubling must be retained in words derived from that root with the ref added to that consonant. Take, for example, ka&#x301;rttika. Since it comes from the root word krttika&#x301;, not krtika&#x301;, ka&#x301;rttika is spelled with two t&#146;s. Similar is the case with parivarttana, anuvarttana, etc. Recently a committee was formed by the Calcutta University authorities to look into spelling conventions. After some discussion the committee issued some statements regarding this matter but they did not give any clear instruction on the subject.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Now let us come to vargiiya ba: antahstha va and vargiiya ba are pronounced and spelled the same in Bengali. However in the Rgveda, Yajurveda and Atharvaveda, vargiiya ba is used separately, although its use is limited. Generally, it is used in four specific cases with, of course, some exceptions.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->1) Words formed from ba&#x301;la&#x301;: ba&#x301;la&#x301;, ba&#x301;laka, ba&#x301;lika&#x301;, priyaba&#x301;la&#x301;, etc. 2) Words formed from bodha: buddha, buddhi, bodhi, prabodha, udbodhana, etc. 3) Words formed from brhat: brhat, brahma, bra&#x301;hman&#x301;a, bra&#x301;hma, etc. 4) Words formed from bandhana: bandhu, bandhana, ba&#x301;ndhava, etc.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->In addition to this there are also a few other instances where vargiiya ba is used.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Vargiiya ba is pronounced like the English &ldquo;ba&rdquo;. Antahstha va is sometimes pronounced like the English &ldquo;va&rdquo; and sometimes like the English &ldquo;wa&rdquo;. In English, in order to lengthen the pronunciation of &ldquo;u&rdquo;, two &ldquo;u&rdquo;s are added together to make &ldquo;w&rdquo; (double &ldquo;u&rdquo;). In French two &ldquo;v&rdquo;s are added together which they call double v. The French would commonly use this double v at the beginning of non-French words in order to render them properly. This double v was not used in old Latin but later on it was accepted in order to facilitate proper pronunciation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->In English the accented letter &ldquo;d&rdquo; is pronounced in two different ways. The Anglo-Saxon style of pronunciation is similar to ja, for example, &ldquo;ejucation&rdquo;, &ldquo;immejiate&rdquo;, &ldquo;guarjian&rdquo;. In the Norman style of pronunciation &ldquo;d&rdquo; is pronounced like d&#x301;a, for example, &ldquo;education&rdquo;, &ldquo;immediate&rdquo;, &ldquo;guardian&rdquo;. Both kinds of pronunciation are correct.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->The various letters are divided into palatal, cerebral and dental letters according to the differences in pronunciation. The palatal letters are pronounced by touching the tongue to the upper palate. For example, ca, cha, ja, jha, ina, and sha are palatal letters. The cerebral letters are pronounced by touching the tongue to the mu&#x301;rdha. The passageway by which water exits when you draw water up through the nose and then expel it through the mouth is known as mu&#x301;rdha. T&#x301;a, t&#x301;ha, d&#x301;a, d&#x301;ha, n&#x301;a, and s&#x301;a are cerebral letters. The name given to those letters that are pronounced by pushing the tongue against the teeth is &ldquo;dental letters&rdquo;. For example, ta, tha, da, dha, na and sa.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->In phonetics there is a hard and fast rule that members from the three different groups of letters cannot combine together to form diphthongs. For example, in the word nishcala, ca is a palatal letter, thus it must have sha as its conjunct, not s&#x301;a or sa. Similarly, cain&#x32D;cala combines ina + ca, not n + ca. Kas&#x301;t&#x301;a cannot be spelled kast&#x301;a. Thus, s&#x301;t&#x301;eshan [station] and pra&#x301;utis&#x301;t&#x301; [Proutist] are always spelled with s&#x301; + t&#x301;a. The only exception is prashna [question]. Prashina would be correct (ina is the palatal na), however for ease of pronunciation both grammarians, Panini and Vopadeva, accepted the substitution of na for the palatal ina in prashna.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->For every rule there is some exception or another. For example, if the English root verb ends in &ldquo;t&rdquo; then the noun is created from that root by adding &ldquo;ion&rdquo;. For example, the noun for the verb &ldquo;opt&rdquo; is &ldquo;option&rdquo;. If it does not end in &ldquo;t&rdquo; then &ldquo;sion&rdquo; is added instead. For example, &ldquo;di &ndash; vide&rdquo; + &ldquo;sion&rdquo; = &ldquo;division&rdquo;, &ldquo;revision&rdquo;, etc. If the root verb has a long vowel then the noun is formed by adding only &ldquo;ion&rdquo;, but instead of pronouncing it shya&#x301;n, it is pronounced tian. For example, &ldquo;question&rdquo; is pronounced &ldquo;quest-i-un&rdquo;, not &ldquo;quest-chen&rdquo;. The one exception is the verb &ldquo;mit&rdquo;. If the root verb is &ldquo;mit&rdquo; then the noun is formed by adding &ldquo;ssion&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;ion&rdquo;. In other words, the correct spelling is &ldquo;mission&rdquo;, not &ldquo;mition&rdquo;, for example, &ldquo;permission&rdquo;, &ldquo;submission&rdquo;, &ldquo;omission&rdquo;, &ldquo;commission&rdquo;, etc.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->Then comes na and ma when they are at the end of the root word and na and ma when they are not at the end of the word. If ma or na come at the end of the root and are followed by a consonant then the fifth letter of that varga is used, or else m&#x301;. For example, sham + kara = shaun&#x32D;kara or sham&#x301;kara. Both are correct. However, m&#x301; is not used to spell saun&#x32D;ga because the na in the verbal root sanj is not a root-ending na. Gaun&#x32D;ga cannot be spelled with m&#x301; because the initial word gam is not a verbal root. It is the singular second-case form of the word ga. Here the word ga means &ldquo;vast land&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Both hard ja and light ya are used in Bengali, however Bengali does not have a letter that corresponds to the English &ldquo;z&rdquo; so its pronunciation can be indicated by adding a dot below the hard ja. This is what I do. The writer Ra&#x301;jashekhar Bose (Parashura&#x301;ma) used the English letter &ldquo;z&rdquo; in his compositions and added an a&#x301; after it &ndash; z<span class=Bengali>&#x09BE;&#x09A8;&#x09A4;&#x09BF; &#x09AA;&#x09BE;&#x09B0; &#x09A8;&#x09BE;</span>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Arabic, Farsi, English, Latin and French all have the letter &ldquo;f&rdquo; but Sanskrit does not. Thus words like takhlif, &ldquo;Finish&rdquo;, &ldquo;fain&rdquo;, kanif, &ldquo;fraternal&rdquo;, etc. cannot be written properly in Sanskrit. I am in favour of adding a dot below the letter pha (<span class=Bengali>&#x09AB;&#x09BC;</span>) for this purpose. However, if it is written with a dot below it then great care must be taken because if the dot is written a little to one side or the other it can create confusion in both pronunciation and meaning.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->Some people use the Bengali letter cha to indicate the sound of the heavily aspirated Arabic sa, for example, chaeyad, echla&#x301;m, etc. I have no objection to this because although the letter does not exist in Bengali its pronunciation has to be indicated in some way. In this case I am personally in favour of adding a dot below the letter sa (<span class=Bengali>&#x09B8;&#x09BC;</span>). However I do not see any reason to object to using cha instead. For example, what is the harm in writing chahii ha&#x301;dich for sahiih ha&#x301;dis.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="6..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Panini, by paying particular attention to sound, was the first to develop the science of phonetics, an inseparable part of philology. Although this was a long time ago, it was not that long ago. By then the Rgvedic and Yajurvedic periods had ended and the Atharvavedic period was in progress. His grammar was based on the Yajurveda, not on the Rgveda, because by then the Rgvedic style of pronunciation had disappeared. For this reason he encountered a good deal of difficulty.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Panini developed special rules for the use of n&#x301;a and s&#x301;a based on phonetics. Earlier I pointed out that the Yajurvedic style of pronunciation was different from the Rgvedic style of pronunciation. Take, for example, the pronunciation of n&#x301;a and s&#x301;a. In the case of Panjabi-speaking areas and nearby areas (in Paesha&#x301;cii Pra&#x301;krta-speaking areas) ks&#x301;ama&#x301; is pronounced khama&#x301;, not ks&#x301;ama&#x301;. This is the Yajurvedic style. Panini was from Ga&#x301;ndha&#x301;r (nowadays partially in Pakistan and partially in Afghanistan). The spoken language of this region during Panini&#146;s time was Pa&#x301;shca&#x301;ttya Pra&#x301;krta. It was Panini&#146;s mother tongue and the ancestor of the modern Pashto language.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Panini observed that in certain areas the pronunciation of n&#x301;a had metamorphosed naturally into r&#x301;han or nan. He accepted this natural pronunciation of n&#x301;a. For example, vipan&#x301;i, ba&#x301;n&#x301;ijya, kalya&#x301;n&#x301;a, and so on, are all pronounced in the Yajurvedic style.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Panini observed that if a word contained ra, r or s&#x301;a then due to their influence the dental na would be pronounced like the cerebral n&#x301;a. Taking phonetics carefully into account, he legitimized this as the n&#x301;a rule, for example, dha&#x301;ran&#x301;a&#x301;. Here he acted according to Yajurvedic phonetics, not Rgvedic, because by then the Rgveda was du&#x301;rast [remote].<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.6.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#6.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> In the Rgvedic style dha&#x301;ran&#x301;a&#x301; becomes dha&#x301;rar&#x301;ha&#x301;n. Many pandits pronounce dha&#x301;ran&#x301;a&#x301; incorrectly.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Panini fixed certain rules in this regard by using psychologically sound means. If, in any compound word, ra, r, or s&#x301;a are present in the first word then the na in the following word is often not affected. For example, harina&#x301;ma. Here there is a break between the two words, hari and na&#x301;ma. For this reason the ra of the first word hari does not affect the na of the second word na&#x301;ma. That is, the na&#x301; remains na. However, if the first word contains the prefix pra or pari then the na in the next word becomes n&#x301;a if it follows immediately afterwards. For example, parin&#x301;a&#x301;ma, pran&#x301;a&#x301;ma, pran&#x301;aya, etc.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->In some cases ra, r, or s&#x301;a in the first word does not influence the following word. However there are some sounds in the following word whose pronunciation is easily affected even if separated by a gap.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.6.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#6.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  If the subsequent word contains a sound which extends the influence of the first word over the second then in such cases the ra of the first word affects the second word and the na changes into n&#x301;a. Some of these kinds of words have become exceptions &ndash; ayana (uttara&#x301;yan&#x301;a), ahna (apara&#x301;hn&#x301;a, pu&#x301;rva&#x301;hn&#x301;a, but madhya&#x301;hna), u&#x301;hinii (aks&#x301;aohin&#x301;ii), gra&#x301;miin&#x301;a, sarva&#x301;ungiin&#x301;a, su&#x301;rpan&#x301;akha&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->In some cases the ra, r or s&#x301;a of the first word does not affect the second word during pronunciation, for example, parinirva&#x301;n&#x301;a. If pra comes before the verbal root nash then it does not have any significant effect, thus pran&#x301;a&#x301;sha can be written with either na or n&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->If a vowel or light consonant falls just after or between ra, r or s&#x301;a then it affects even a distantly situated na. In this case, the rule is that ra, r or s&#x301;a affects the na even if it does not immediately follow it. For example, va&#x301;s&#x301;pa&#x301;yan&#x301;a. In the case of vowels, ka varga, ya, va, and ha the distant na becomes n&#x301;a even if they are situated far away and even if any of them occurs more than once.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Panini framed the rules of n&#x301;a and s&#x301;a in such a way in his Sanskrit grammar that it is cent-per-cent acoustically-based. But it is worth pointing out that this style of pronunciation was already in existence, that is, people used to pronounce it that way. All that Panini did was to give this style of pronunciation a systematic form. He brought it within the scope of a formula.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->The Bengali language differs from Sanskrit in many areas. Bengali has only the sha pronunciation, not that of s&#x301;a or sa. However, although there is no separate pronunciation of s&#x301;a, in special circumstances there is a slight difference in pronunciation. For example, s&#x301;an&#x301;d&#x301;a, ra&#x301;ks&#x301;asa. In one case the s&#x301;a is pronounced one way &ndash; s&#x301;an&#x301;d&#x301;a &ndash; and in the other it is pronounced differently &ndash; ra&#x301;ks&#x301;asa (k + s&#x301;a = ks&#x301;a (kha)). Sa only survives as a written letter; it doesn&#146;t have any separate pronunciation. Some people incorrectly pronounce words spelled with sha with a type of distorted sa sound. People like to make jokes about this. For example, sya&#x301;mava&#x301;ja&#x301;rer Sasiiva&#x301;vu sasa&#x301; khete khete sedin sa&#x301;sa&#x301;cchilen [Shyambazaar&#146;s Mr. Shashii threatened while eating a cucumber that day].<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.6.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#6.fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> Another example of how Bengali and Sanskrit have deviated from each other in many instances in terms of pronunciation is that in Sanskrit s&#x301;a can be substituted for sa when a verbal root beginning with sa follows the prefix ni. Thus in Sanskrit both nis&#x301;a&#x301;da and nisa&#x301;da are correct (ni &ndash; sad verbal root suffixed by ghain&#x32D;). In Bengali only nis&#x301;a&#x301;da is used. If anyone spells nis&#x301;a&#x301;da with sa then some pandits may very well mark it wrong. The same goes for upanis&#x301;ada (upa &ndash; ni &ndash; s&#x301;ad verbal root, kvip suffix = upanis&#x301;ada in Bengali). In Sanskrit both upanis&#x301;ada and upanisada are correct. Bengali has the letter sa but no separate pronunciation for it, so it is avoided as much as possible.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->The suffix shatr has been used after the parasmaepadii verbal root to signify ya&#x301; cale caleche [that which has been going]. At the time of the Rgveda there was a clear line of demarcation between parasmaepadii and a&#x301;tmanepadii. Whenever one&#146;s own self was the main subject then a&#x301;tmanepadii was used and whenever another was the main subject then parasmaepadii was used. Wherever self [a&#x301;tma] or para [other] was not made clear then it was considered ubhayapadii. A&#x301;tmanedpadii was used extensively in the Rgveda but its use diminished in the Yajurveda. Its usage disappeared for all intents and purposes in the Atharvaveda. Panini&#146;s mother tongue was not Vedic Sanskrit, however he had to base his division of a&#x301;tmanepadii and parasmaepadii verbs on the Vedas, so he met with some difficulty in this regard.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Often it is difficult to determine which is a&#x301;tmanepadii and which is parasmaepadii. Take, for example, the verbal roots cal [to go] and ji [to triumph]. In the Rgveda they are a&#x301;tmanepadii, for example, jayate &ndash; satyameva jayate [truth alone triumphs]. However in modern Sanskrit the verbal root ji is parasmaepadii, thus jayati. Of course, after a prefix the verbal root ji is a&#x301;tmanepadii, for example, vi &ndash; jayati = vijayate. Due to these kinds of difficulties he accepted the use of ubhayapadii.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Vopadeva only accepted the use of parasmaepadii. Hence shatr will be added to cal, not sha&#x301;nac (to indicate present participle), because in Laokika Sanskrit the verbal root cal is parasmaepadii. However, after a lot of thought I finally recalled a Sanskrit shloka from the time of the Buddha, twenty-five hundred years ago, which uses the verbal root cal in a&#x301;tmanepadii (in the laokika sense). The example is:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..14"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Iha&#x301;sane shus&#x301;yatu me shariiram<br>Tvagasthima&#x301;m&#x301;sam&#x301; pralayain&#x32D;ca ya&#x301;tu<br>Apra&#x301;pyabodhim&#x301;bahukalpadurlabha&#x301;m&#x301;<br>Naeva&#x301;sana&#x301;t ka&#x301;yamatashcalisyate<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Thus Panini was forced to accept ubhayapadii because cal verbal root + shatr = calat. For example, calat + citra = calaccitra. And cal + sha&#x301;nac = calama&#x301;na. Both are correct. Bear in mind that shatr, sha&#x301;nac, a&#x301;tmanepadii, parasmaepadii, short, long and extended vowels, pronunciation &ndash; all of these change as the era changes. They have done so in the past and will continue to do so in the future.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->In Sanskrit the suffix kvip is used in the sense of &ldquo;natural inclination&rdquo;. For example, gam + kvip = jagat [world] or &ldquo;that whose nature is to move&rdquo;. However, where it is haye caleche [in continuity] then the suffix is shatr. For example, gam + shatr = gacchat [going]. In the case of sha&#x301;nac, since it is a&#x301;tmanepadii then sha&#x301;nac is okay even if it does not preserve much rhythm. That is, sha&#x301;nac has a light rhythm. Either ma&#x301;n or a&#x301;n is added to sha&#x301;nac. Generally here, when the original verbal root ends in a consonant (for example, sev), then the third person dual ete is used in its lat&#x301; (sevete).<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.6.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#6.fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> In this case, in place of this ete, ma&#x301;na is used with the aforementioned verbal root sev (sevama&#x301;na). If the original verbal root ends in a vowel (for example, shii), then in lat&#x301;, third person, dual number, a&#x301;te is used (shaya&#x301;te). In this case, if sha&#x301;nac is added to the verbal root shii, then a&#x301;na (shaya&#x301;na) is used in place of a&#x301;te. In the case of svabha&#x301;va [natural inclination] and in the sense of continuity, the two different forms of the same verb are not used in Sanskrit, but they are with the verbal adjectives. In English the verbal adjectives are formed by adding the suffixes &ldquo;ing&rdquo; and &ldquo;ed&rdquo;, etc. In the Indian language Bhojpuri, however, there are separate verbs for the verb forms in the sense of the natural inclination and for haye caleche. For example, Ra&#x301;mka bha&#x301;i par&#x301;ela&#x301; and Ra&#x301;mka bha&#x301;i par&#x301;ata&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>

Vopadeva added lightness, but in order to make it easy to add this lightness he ended up making the grammar complex. Panini&#146;s composition and formation of grammar was quite strong and beautiful; it has a scientific framework. There is no latitude [jo] given it to meander here and there.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.6.fn5"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#6.fn5">5</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Now let us see what happens with this phonetics in Arabic. In the majority of the European languages &ldquo;h&rdquo; at the beginning of a word is not pronounced. For example, &ldquo;hotel&rdquo;. In French it is pronounced otel. However in Arabic it is not silent. Sometimes it is pronounced and sometimes it is partially pronounced. In Arabic, if there is a vowel or an &ldquo;h&rdquo; after a word then the sixth case declension ul is inserted in place of a pronounced or unpronounced &ldquo;h&rdquo;. Where there is a clearly pronounced or silent consonant then the form of the sixth case declension is changed consistent with the sound of the consonant. For example, phajal + ul + rahaman = phajalur-rahama&#x301;n. Here the consonant ra is partially pronounced thus we cannot say ul; it becomes phajalur. However, a&#x301;jij + ul + hak = a&#x301;jijuahak because the consonant ha in the word hak is fully pronounced. Thus the l is retained here making a&#x301;jijulhak. Najar + ul + isla&#x301;m = najarulisla&#x301;m because the vowel l is clearly pronounced. However, a&#x301;jim + ul + sa&#x301;n = a&#x301;jimusya&#x301;n because here the consonant sa is clearly pronounced, thus ul is not retained. In the same way, sha&#x301;ms + ul + na&#x301;ha&#x301;r = sha&#x301;msunna&#x301;ha&#x301;r.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->Grammatical aphorisms are put together according to proper and natural pronunciation for the sake of phonetics. The style of pronunciation is created beforehand. Through careful listening the grammarians record this pronunciation at the syllabic level. For this reason all the languages of the world are bound together on a single thread; in the absence of phonetics no language can move a single step. Bengali has Turkish words as well, along with Arabic and Persian. Careful attention must be paid so that these words can be pronounced properly.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->In all languages pronunciation changes in order to keep pace with vowel sounds. For example, in English there are twenty-one different pronunciations of the letter &ldquo;a&rdquo; but in French there is only one, the Bengali a&#x301;. In French &ldquo;Paris&rdquo; is pronounced pa&#x301;rii &ndash; the &ldquo;s&rdquo; is silent because the rule in French is that in most cases the final consonant is not pronounced at the end of a word; if the final consonant is &ldquo;c&rdquo;, &ldquo;f&rdquo;, &ldquo;l&rdquo;, or &ldquo;r&rdquo; then it is pronounced. To facilitate their pronunciation a vowel sound is added afterwards. Many people mistakenly spell the French word madame &ldquo;madam&rdquo;. If madame is spelled in French without the final &ldquo;e&rdquo; then its pronunciation becomes ma&#x301;da&#x301;n. It has to be spelled with an &ldquo;e&rdquo; at the end in order to preserve the correct pronunciation. In French the masculine singular for &ldquo;my&rdquo; is mon and the feminine singular is ma. The plural is mes, thus the plural for madame is mesdames. Some people mistakenly read this as &ldquo;may-s-day-m-s&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;A&rdquo; in English is a light vowel, thus if a root verb occurs after the prefix &ldquo;a&rdquo; then the first consonant is doubled. For example, &ldquo;a + quire&rdquo;. Here &ldquo;quire&rdquo; is the root verb and &ldquo;a&rdquo; is the prefix. In this case the &ldquo;q&rdquo; should be doubled, however since double &ldquo;q&rdquo; cannot be pronounced, a &ldquo;c&rdquo; is substituted instead; it becomes &ldquo;acquire&rdquo;. The same is the case with &ldquo;acquisition&rdquo;, but in the case of &ldquo;require&rdquo; and &ldquo;requisition&rdquo; the consonant is not doubled because &ldquo;e&rdquo; is not a light vowel.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->This rule is followed in Sanskrit. It is doubled in accordance with the rules of phonetics. For example, taran&#x301; + apashyat = taran&#x301;n&#x301;apashyat, that is, &ldquo;he saw [dekhle] while swimming&rdquo;. (Now, tell me, will it be dekhla or dekhle in the spoken language of Calcutta? It will be dekhle. In Rarhi Bengali it will be dekhlek in this case. Bear in mind that if the final k is dropped from the Rarhi Bengali it becomes the Calcutta Bengali. Of course, in this case the transitive and intransitive verb forms are different. Similarly, the spoken form of se balila [he spoke] will not be se balla but rather se balle.)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->In French the masculine form of the definite article (the) is le, the feminine form is la and the plural form is les. However here the pronunciation of this le, la and les changes where there is elision. In such cases the spelling practice becomes paramount. For example, &ldquo;the men&rdquo; in French is not le am but lezam [les hommes].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->The English word &ldquo;knife&rdquo; comes from the French word kanife. Here the English letter &ldquo;k&rdquo; is silent. However, since &ldquo;knife&rdquo; comes from the French word kanife, it is still spelt with a &ldquo;k&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;H&rdquo; at the beginning of a word is silent in French, for example, &ldquo;history&rdquo; &ndash; the French pronunciation is istoire. &ldquo;Hotel&rdquo; in French is pronounced otel, however in English the pronunciation of the &ldquo;h&rdquo; is maintained, thus it is pronounced &ldquo;hotel&rdquo;. &ldquo;Hospital&rdquo; in French is pronounced opital, but in English it is &ldquo;hospital&rdquo;. However, in the case of &ldquo;honour&rdquo; the French style of pronunciation, ona&#x301;r, has been preserved in English. Even uneducated French people follow these natural pronunciation practices.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->Not only is the pronunciation and spelling of prefixes influenced by the style of vowel pronunciation, suffixes are as well. The &ldquo;pre&rdquo; of &ldquo;prefix&rdquo; is a Latin prefix and &ldquo;fix&rdquo; is a verbal root. Thus &ldquo;pre&rdquo; + &ldquo;fix&rdquo; makes &ldquo;prefix&rdquo;. In Sanskrit there are twenty prefixes. &ldquo;Suffix&rdquo; is derived from placing &ldquo;sub&rdquo; before &ldquo;fix&rdquo;, that is, &ldquo;sub&rdquo; + &ldquo;fix&rdquo;. Here the &ldquo;b&rdquo; becomes an &ldquo;f&rdquo; because &ldquo;b&rdquo; is a medium consonant, thus &ldquo;suffix&rdquo; is spelled with two &ldquo;f&rdquo;s. The first &ldquo;f&rdquo; of &ldquo;suffix&rdquo; is a substitute for &ldquo;b&rdquo;; the second &ldquo;f&rdquo; is a hard sound.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->If there is a suffix added to the root word then it is called taddhita, and in the case of a verbal root with an added suffix it is called krtprakaran&#x301;a. In this krt or taddhita process of adding a suffix to a root word or verbal root, the original root word or verbal root occasions, in some cases, a change in consonant, and sometimes a change in vowel. For example, sarvajana + iin = sarvajaniin. If s&#x301;n&#x301;ik is added to sarvajana it makes sarvajanik but instead it is pronounced sa&#x301;rvajanik.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->Sometimes in the roots of Arabic words, if the verbal root is made into a noun then mu is added and a change occurs in the second consonant. For example, musha&#x301;fir means &ldquo;one who makes a journey [sha&#x301;far]&rdquo;. In this case, according to the rule, mu is added before shafar and it becomes musha&#x301;fir. Mu + shafar = musha&#x301;fir. Similarly, mu + ha&#x301;jir = muha&#x301;jer; mu + sa&#x301;hib = musa&#x301;heb. This change in the second is not a product of grammar but of the people. When Arabic arrived in India the Kora&#x301;n&#x301;asharif had already been written down. Arabic grammar came into being after the composition of the Koran. There are a great number of Arabic words in Bengali but they came much later.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->These kinds of rules also exist in English. There is an English rule that when there are two vowels then the short vowel follows the long vowel. In Bengali also it is priiti &rarr; piiriti (not piriiti). Sanskrit also follows this rule. Panini said that whenever a consonant follows which requires the vowel to be lengthened in order to facilitate its pronunciation then the vowel becomes long. For example, caks&#x301;u + roga; the spelling will be caks&#x301;u&#x301;roga. Similarly, ni + rava = niirava. The ra of caks&#x301;u&#x301;roga is a hard ra. In the case of a light ra this does not take place.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->When &ldquo;i&rdquo; and &ldquo;e&rdquo; are placed side by side in English then the &ldquo;i&rdquo; comes first because its pronunciation is longer and stronger than that of the &ldquo;e&rdquo;. The pronunciation of &ldquo;i&rdquo; is always i, but there are many pronunciations of &ldquo;e&rdquo; &ndash; i, e, a&#x301; &ndash; thus &ldquo;e&rdquo; comes after &ldquo;i&rdquo;. However, there can be exceptions after a light consonant, for example, &ldquo;ceive&rdquo;. Here &ldquo;c&rdquo; is the original consonant, thus &ldquo;i&rdquo; comes after &ldquo;e&rdquo; in the verbal root &ldquo;ceive&rdquo;. This rule remains in force when the verbal root &ldquo;ceive&rdquo; follows different prefixes, for example, &ldquo;receive&rdquo;, &ldquo;perceive&rdquo;, etc. Similar is the case with &ldquo;leisure&rdquo;, &ldquo;counterfeit&rdquo;, and so on. Hindi also follows some of these same rules, for example, lar&#x301;kii, but lar&#x301;kia&#x301;n.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="7..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The Bengali or Gaor&#x301;iiya style of vowel pronunciation differs from the other three accepted styles of pronunciation in India. It has some deviations from the rules of Sanskrit but they are accepted. It is also not contrary to phonetics if there are difficulties in elision or spelling. In Laokika Sanskrit there are four accepted original styles of pronunciation &ndash; Ka&#x301;shika&#x301;, Maha&#x301;ra&#x301;s&#x301;t&#x301;rii, Dravidian and Bengali.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->A is pronounced in three ways: sam&#x301;vrta, vivrta, and tiryaka. Bengali pronunciation is sam&#x301;vrta. The Ka&#x301;shika&#x301; style is vivrta pronunciation. The pronunciation of the remaining two is so lengthened or extended that the pronunciation of ka sounds like ka&#x301;, kha like kha&#x301;, and ga like ga&#x301;. For example, Pa&#x301;t&#x301;na&#x301; is written &ldquo;Patna&rdquo; in English, Pat&#x301;na&#x301; in Hindi, Pat&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301; in Marathii and Pa&#x301;t&#x301;na&#x301; in Bengali. Each spelling is correct according to its own style of pronunciation. Moreover, all aspects of these spellings follow some particular accepted style.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Now the pronunciation of the letter a&#x301; in the Gaor&#x301;iiya style is simply a&#x301;. In the remaining styles it is long a&#x301; &ndash; like the pronunciation of the French letter &ldquo;a&rdquo;. For example, cheval (meaning &ldquo;horse&rdquo;), hopital (&ldquo;hospital&rdquo; in English). In both of these the pronunciation of the letter &ldquo;a&rdquo; is long a&#x301;. In eastern India it is simple a&#x301;. Jamalpur is written Ja&#x301;ma&#x301;lpur in eastern India while in the rest of India it is written and pronounced Jama&#x301;lpur.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->There is a great deal of similarity between the Arabic and Hebrew languages. For example, the Arabic a&#x301;lif is alif [eya&#x301;lif] in Hebrew. In Greek it is alpha; however the Greek style of pronunciation differs somewhat because in Greek there is a limited pronunciation of the ta varga. The pronunciation of the t&#x301;a varga is more extensive. I noticed this especially when I was in Greece.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Both Arabic and Hebrew are Semitic languages and for this reason the relationship between them is extremely close. Here are a few examples of this closeness:<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="7..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->The Sanskrit letter a, like the Roman letter &ldquo;a&rdquo; also has various pronunciations. Although the letter e in Sanskrit is pronounced nearly the same everywhere, it is not exactly the same. In Vedic long e is pronounced but there is no practice of writing it.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Ae comes after e. In Sanskrit it is pronounced aya&#x301;y. For this reason &ldquo;bank&rdquo; can be written vaem&#x301;k in Sanskrit and in Hindi as well. Only in Bengali style is it written bya&#x301;m&#x301;k. In Sanskrit this pronunciation would become bia&#x301;m&#x301;k. Sanskrit and Bengali differ just as ta&#x301;l [palm] and gol do. If someone mistakes a ta&#x301;l tree for a gol tree or vice versa then we say that they have twisted things around.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->In the Calcutta pronunciation of pet&#x301;, tel, bel, etc. the e is not pronounced eya&#x301;, that is, they are not pronounced pya&#x301;t&#x301;, tya&#x301;l, bya&#x301;l. In some areas they are pronounced pya&#x301;t&#x301;, tya&#x301;l, bya&#x301;l. This kind of pronunciation runs contrary to Sanskrit style. It happens due to the influence of Indo-Burmese pronunciation. In Rarh the village folk pronounce e as e, not as eya&#x301;. They do not say eya&#x301;ka&#x301;dash for eka&#x301;dash. This kind of pronunciation such as eya&#x301;ga&#x301;ra, eya&#x301;ka&#x301;dash etc. does not concord with Aryan styles of pronunciation. The pronunciation of Rarh concords with the Aryan styles.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->The pronunciation of the letter o is correct, but according to the Sanskrit style of pronunciation the letter ao (<span class=Bengali>&#x0994;</span>) is pronounced a-o. In Hindi the word aos&#x301;adh is pronounced aos&#x301;adh. Other examples are mahaos&#x301;adh, aks&#x301;aohin&#x301;ii, daolat and so on. The pronunciation of ae and ao in Sanskrit should be maintained according to Sanskrit style, otherwise it will create difficulties with vowel elision.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Ninety-three percent of the Bengali vocabulary comes from Sanskrit. There is no need for those Sanskrit words to be pronounced in Sanskrit style if they are to be used in Bengali because there is a difference of four generations between Sanskrit and Bengali &ndash; Sanskrit &rarr; Pra&#x301;krta &rarr; Demi-Pra&#x301;krta &rarr; old Bengali &rarr; modern Bengali. A&#x301;mra &rarr; a&#x301;mba &rarr; a&#x301;mba&#x301; &rarr; a&#x301;nbaa &rarr; a&#x301;nb [mango]. Many Bengalees say a&#x301;m but from the standpoint of linguistic derivation, a&#x301;nb is much more correct. Two and a half of the three letters that make up the Pra&#x301;krta word a&#x301;mba remain in the word a&#x301;nb &ndash; the letter a&#x301;, the full ba, and a half in the candrabindu form of the letter ma. In a&#x301;m, however, only two letters remain. Similar is the case with ta&#x301;nba&#x301; and na&#x301;ba&#x301;. For example, in Panjabi one says a&#x301;mb-da&#x301;-aca&#x301;r. It is incorrect.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Pra&#x301;krta pronunciation differs from Sanskrit pronunciation. Furthermore, there are differences in pronunciation from one Pra&#x301;krta to another. Take, for example, Ma&#x301;gadhii Pra&#x301;krta: in Sanskrit, pus&#x301;pa; in Ma&#x301;gadhii Pra&#x301;krta, pus&#x301;pala; in Demi-Ma&#x301;gadhii, puphphala; in the old form of modern Bengali, pupphul; and in modern Bengali phul. In Pa&#x301;shca&#x301;ttya Pra&#x301;krta, pus&#x301;pa becomes pos&#x301;p. For example, the Sanskrit padmapus&#x301;pa will be padampos&#x301;p in Pa&#x301;shca&#x301;ttya Pra&#x301;krta. In Demi-Pra&#x301;krta it is paampos&#x301;p, and in modern Kashmirii it is pampos&#x301;. Kashmirii, Pashto, Tazaki, and Uzbeki, and so on, that is, the languages of southern Russia, have evolved from Pa&#x301;shca&#x301;ttya Pra&#x301;krta. The Russian language is a descendant of Vedic, thus there is some similarity between Russian and the language of the Rgveda. For example, the Vedic words nah, vah, etc. are used in Russian. We can see that there is a close connection between the Vedic and Russian languages. The study of philology and phonetics will do a lot to close the distances and eliminate inequalities between people, and it will also help to establish Neohumanism. Is there any wonder then that there is some difference between the Sanskrit pronunciation of eastern India and that of the rest of India!<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->The pronunciation of vowels in Oriya is similar to Bengali. However, in Oriya, if a word borrowed from Sanskrit or half-borrowed does not have a hasanta then it is fully pronounced while in Bengali such words are not always fully pronounced.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.7.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#7.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> Oriya is influenced by the pronunciation of the Atharvaveda and Bengali is not. Bengali is influenced by the Yajurvedic style of pronunciation because the pandits used to follow the pronunciation style of whatever Veda they followed and ultimately that influence made itself felt in the spoken language. It is to some extent for this reason that Bengali is influenced by Yajurvedic pronunciation while Oriya is influenced by Atharvavedic pronunciation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Most of those Bengali Brahmans who have a large number of Rarhi Brahmans among them follow the Sa&#x301;maveda but the Sa&#x301;maveda does not have any pronunciation style of its own. This has resulted in a disorderly situation as regards pronunciation. The majority of the Barendra Brahmans follow the Yajurveda and a small number follow the Rgveda. As one of a number of educated communities, the Ka&#x301;yasthas follow the Yajurveda, thus the social life of Bengal as well as its language is more influenced by the Yajurveda. However in the local life of Bengal, especially in the outlying areas, there is some Indo-Burmese and Indo-Tibetan influence, both in the racial makeup as well as in the language. There is no escaping this; it is simply not possible. The ancient Bengali poet, Vijaygupta, has heaped his abuse in this way:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..15"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Sarvema&#x301;m&#x301;sarata&#x301;h mu&#x301;d&#x301;ha&#x301;h mleccha&#x301;h gobrahmagha&#x301;taka&#x301;h<br>Kuvacaka&#x301;h pare mu&#x301;d&#x301;ha&#x301;h ete ku&#x301;t&#x301;ayonayah<br>Tes&#x301;a&#x301;m&#x301; paesha&#x301;cikii bha&#x301;s&#x301;a&#x301; loka&#x301;ca&#x301;ro na vidyate<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->That is: &ldquo;These people are addicted to all kinds of meat. They are fools who refuse to follow the scriptural injunctions of the Vedas. They do not venerate cows and Vipras [priestly caste]. They speak a non-Vedic language, a barbarian language which is very distant from the Vedic language.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->However he himself was not able to keep aloof from its influence. The suffix s&#x301;ak has been used in the word kuvacaka&#x301;h. Generally, when the word formed from the verbal root can be either nominative or accusative then the suffix s&#x301;ak is fixed for the nominative and the suffix n&#x301;ak for the accusative. For example, ranj + s&#x301;ak = rajaka. It means &ldquo;one who colours&rdquo;. And ranj + n&#x301;ak = rain&#x32D;jaka which means &ldquo;that by which something is coloured&rdquo;, for example, &ldquo;rain&#x32D;jaka soap&rdquo;. The Indo-Burmese and Indo-Tibetan influence on the local life of Bengal has been unobstructed because they are Bengal&#146;s neighbours. Thus in the Northeast their influence is greater and in the Southwest it is less.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->There is some idea that activates the verb and there is another faculty that qualifies it. The first we can call the &ldquo;activating idea&rdquo; and the second the &ldquo;activated faculty&rdquo;. In the first it should be understood that the verb is separate from the idea and in the second what is implied is that this faculty is linked to the verb. For example, sam &ndash; ci + al = sain&#x32D;caya. Here sam is the activating idea, thus ci is subtracted from it. This is indicated by the minus sign (-). In Sanskrit grammatical subtraction is called pu&#x301;rvaka. Al (ac in some people&#146;s opinion) is the activated faculty. Ci links the activated faculty to the original verbal root. The word ka&#x301;ya is formed by adding ghain&#x32D; to ci as the verbal root (ci + ghain&#x32D; = ka&#x301;ya). Here the ca varga has been changed to ka varga. The meaning of ci is &ldquo;to collect&rdquo;. The body, that is, ka&#x301;ya, is created by collecting water, blood and other substances. Thus ghain&#x32D; is the activated faculty. In Sanskrit this is referred to as pratyaya [suffix]. The word upasarga [prefix] is used in Sanskrit to refer to the activating idea. In Sanskrit there are twenty upasargas or activating ideas. For example:<!-- /block --></p>

In English and the Latin family languages upasarga is called &ldquo;prefix&rdquo; and pratyaya is called &ldquo;suffix&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->The Latin family of languages has three branches: Continental Latin, Occido-Demi-Latin, and Oriento-Demi-Latin. Continental Latin includes German, Czech, Hungarian, Polish, Finnish, and so on. Occido-Demi-Latin includes two and a half &ndash; Spanish, Portuguese and Basque. Basque can be called a half-language because it is a mixture of Portuguese and Spanish. Oriento-Demi-Latin includes French and Italian. The Occido-Demi-Latin languages have retained all of the Latin prefixes. There are two pairs of languages on this earth which are very similar to one another: Spanish and Portuguese, and Bengali and Oriya.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->There are two principal styles of pronunciation in English &ndash; Anglo-Saxon and Norman. In the Anglo-Saxon style the English &ldquo;d&rdquo; is pronounced like &ldquo;j&rdquo; while in the Norman style it is pronounced like a hard &ldquo;d&rdquo;. For example:<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="7..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->These branches of the Latin language are prevalent in South America, thus South America is called Latin America.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->When the Portuguese came to this country we absorbed many words from their language, for example ca&#x301;bi [key]. &ldquo;Ch&rdquo; is pronounced like sha in Portuguese, for example, sha&#x301;bi. In Spanish it is also sha&#x301;bi; in Bengali, ca&#x301;bi; in Hindi, ca&#x301;bhi (kuin&#x32D;jii). Of course, Bengali also has its own word for ca&#x301;bi &ndash; ka&#x301;t&#x301;hi &ndash; kulupka&#x301;t&#x301;hi (ca&#x301;bika&#x301;t&#x301;hi is also said). The word kha&#x301;r&#x301;a&#x301; is also used to refer to ka&#x301;t&#x301;hi. Kha&#x301;r&#x301;a&#x301; is a native Bengali word. In Rarhi Bengali deshala&#x301;i ka&#x301;t&#x301;hi [match] is called deshala&#x301;i kha&#x301;r&#x301;a&#x301;. At one time the place which is now called Chandannagar was the home of the Bengali Suvarnabaniks [a caste] called Chandra, thus its name became Chandranagar. Its French pronunciation was Chandernagore, which in Bengali became Chandannagar. There is no connection between the city&#146;s name and the word candan [sandalwood]. The French word pain&#x32D;, which means bread, is pa&#x301;on&#x32D; in the Iberian language. It is supposed that when the Portuguese brought their kind of bread to this country they used to call it pa&#x301;on&#x32D; and thus this particular type of bread became pa&#x301;on&#x32D;rut&#x301;i in Bengali.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->Latin has both prefixes and suffixes. In fact, most of the world&#146;s languages use prefixes and suffixes. Even those languages which are undeveloped but which have come from developed languages also use prefixes and suffixes. Prefixes and suffixes carry the specialities of a language. During the time of Var&#x301;u Can&#x301;d&#x301;iida&#x301;s, about six to seven hundred years ago, Bengali was not a developed language but it still used prefixes and suffixes. Prefixes and suffixes are needed for the formation of new words. For example, by adding the suffix &ldquo;ing&rdquo; to the root word &ldquo;fight&rdquo; in English, the verbal adjective &ldquo;fighting&rdquo; is created. When confronted with developed languages people cannot remain satisfied with an undeveloped language so they enrich their own language by picking up like-meaning words from those other languages. It is due to this that a learned person prefers the Latin word &ldquo;belligerent&rdquo; to the ordinary English word &ldquo;fighting&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->In Bengali we say: a&#x301;mi a&#x301;sha&#x301;va&#x301;dii chilum [I was hopeful]. Many learned people write the Latin word &ldquo;sanguine&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;hopeful&rdquo; for the word a&#x301;sha&#x301;va&#x301;dii. This tendency to use developed words in good language can be seen in people of all countries and all epochs, and it will remain so. For example, in Birbhum someone may ask someone else in Bengali: hya&#x301;nre barkat, tor bet&#x301;a&#x301;-bit&#x301;i ka&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301;? [Hey, Barkat, how many children do you have?] Often it is seen that instead of replying with bet&#x301;a&#x301;-bit&#x301;i, one says a&#x301;ma&#x301;r tint&#x301;i putra a&#x301;che [I have three sons].<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.7.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#7.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> A prefix is used before a word. It signifies that a certain part has been separated from a greater idea. Along with it a suffix is added, that is, a firm suffix or trust is placed that corresponds to exactly the way I would like it to be.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->The corresponding Sanskrit suffix for the English &ldquo;er&rdquo; is d&#x301;a. Both perform the same function; they are both activated faculties. For example: In English, &ldquo;go + er = goer&rdquo;; &ldquo;see + er = seer&rdquo;; and &ldquo;do + er = doer&rdquo;, while in Sanskrit trae + d&#x301;a = tra and gam + d&#x301;a = ga. Gae + shatr + trae + d&#x301;a = ga&#x301;yattra. By adding the feminine iip we get ga&#x301;yattrii. (Since the verbal root contains a truncated consonant [halanta] then the truncated consonant also crops up in the derivation of the suffix. For example, gam + d&#x301;a = ga. If another vowel is present instead of a then that vowel is changed into a, for example, trae + d&#x301;a = tra. This is the speciality of the suffix d&#x301;a.)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->The word ga has two meanings. The first is &ldquo;far-off country&rdquo; or &ldquo;vast land&rdquo;. The other meaning is &ldquo;goer&rdquo; (masculine). Thus the meaning of the word gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301; is &ldquo;that river which flows through a vast land&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->Bengali is a living language so it has not stopped at only the twenty Sanskrit prefixes. It has borrowed many Farsi words and Farsi prefixes as well. For example, &ldquo;one who does not have faith [ima&#x301;n]&rdquo; is beima&#x301;n; &ldquo;one who does not have an heir [wa&#x301;rish]&rdquo; is bewa&#x301;rish; &ldquo;one who has no sense [a&#x301;kkel]&rdquo; is be-a&#x301;kkile. Similar is the case with behuda&#x301; [unjust, unnecessary], na&#x301;sta&#x301;na&#x301;bud [ruined], and so on. In Farsi &ldquo;work&rdquo; is ka&#x301;r. &ldquo;One who does not have work&rdquo; is be-ka&#x301;r. &ldquo;A place where there is work&rdquo; is ka&#x301;rkha&#x301;na&#x301; [factory]. &ldquo;One who is skilful in work&rdquo; is ka&#x301;rigar. In this way innumerable Farsi words have filtered into Bengali.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->The corresponding Arabic prefix for the Farsi be is la&#x301;. There are few Arabic prefixes in Bengali. The Farsi word be-wa&#x301;rish is la&#x301;-wa&#x301;rish in Arabic. It should be mentioned here that while Arabic words have entered the Bengali language for religious and commercial reasons, they have not been incorporated naturally into Bengali. So although Arabic words are used to some extent, there is less use of Arabic prefixes and suffixes. A few examples of such words in use are: musa&#x301;phir [traveller], mosa&#x301;heb [flatterer], muya&#x301;jjin [muezzin], etc.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->If we say beta&#x301;r [radio] in Farsi, then in Arabic we say la&#x301;silki. Silik in Arabic means &ldquo;fine fibre&rdquo;. The fine fibres that came to Bengal from China were given the Sanskrit name ciina&#x301;m&#x301;shuka. This ciina&#x301;m&#x301;shuka&#x301; was given the Farsi name resham and the Arabic name silik. Arab merchants used to export this ciina&#x301;m&#x301;shuka to the markets of Europe. When they were heard saying the Arabic word in Europe, ciina&#x301;m&#x301;shuka became &ldquo;silk&rdquo; with the help of a little faulty pronunciation.<!-- /block --></p>

Ha&#x301; &ndash; bha&#x301;tiya&#x301; has become ha&#x301;-bha&#x301;te: ha&#x301; &ndash; bha&#x301;ta + iya&#x301;. Here iya&#x301; is a suffix. Similarly a&#x301;-dekhle comes from a&#x301;-dekhila&#x301;. The Rarhi Bengali sopare comes from sa&#x301;gara-pa&#x301;riya&#x301;. It means &ldquo;chilli pepper&rdquo; [laun&#x32D;ka&#x301;].

When they arrived in Persia they liked it very much. Previously they were only familiar with barley and oats. They discovered wheat for the first time when they came to this country. Wheat is called godhu&#x301;ma in Sanskrit. Go means &ldquo;tongue&rdquo; and dhu&#x301;ma means &ldquo;festival&rdquo;. When they ate wheat they realized how tasty it was, that is, it was like a festival for the tongue so they called it godhu&#x301;ma. In Hindi it is gehu&#x301;n and in Bihar, gohu&#x301;m; in Oriya and Rarhi Bengali, gaham; and in Calcutta Bengali, gam. They all come from the word godhu&#x301;ma.

For this reason they gave paddy the name vriihi which means &ldquo;that in which a great deal of capacity is hidden&rdquo;. For example, bahuvriihi sama&#x301;sa means &ldquo;that sama&#x301;sa [compound word] which contains the opportunity for pervasive expression&rdquo;.

In Arabic the country&#146;s name is Pha&#x301;ras. The name Pha&#x301;ras continued to be used for a long time and in English it became &ldquo;Persia&rdquo;.

<a name="7..38"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=38 type=paragraph -->In the course of different discussions we have seen that since its very birth the Bengali language has been inseparably bound to the Sanskrit language. Not only should the people of Bengal consider Sanskrit to be their religious language or spiritual language, similar to Arabic or Pali, but it should also be accepted as their original language. Sanskrit has been joined to the pulse of the Bengalees for generation after generation; it cannot be rejected because of changing events. If they try to distance themselves from it, thinking it to be the religious language of the Hindus and the Maha&#x301;ya&#x301;na Buddhists, they will not cause the Sanskrit language any harm but they will cause harm to the Bengali-speaking people. The Bengali language stands upon the firm foundation of Sanskrit. If a blow is struck to that firm foundation then the infrastructure of the Bengali language will find itself tottering. The study of Sanskrit should be made compulsory at the university level. In advanced fields Sanskrit should be retained as a separate paper included in the study of Bengali, whether or not it is studied as a separate language. This will be a strong and well-merited step.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="8..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Every language has its own special characteristics. It is these special characteristics that set one language apart from another. On the other hand, some aspects are the same in every language, for example, prefixes and suffixes. Bengali, as well as the other Indo-Aryan languages, comes from Sanskrit, however the languages of India&#146;s Dravidian people belong to the Austrico-Negroid group of languages. They are Telegu, Tamil, Malayalam, Kannad and Tulu.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->At one time the Arabian Sea did not exist. The southwestern portion of India was connected to Africa by a land route. Austrico-Negroid is the name of the racial mixture that was created by the mixing of the Indian and African peoples of that time. The composition of those languages does not accord with Sanskrit style but they do use a great number of Sanskrit words. For example, more than seventy-five percent of Malayalam and more than fifty percent of Telegu and Kannad is Sanskrit. However in Tamil it is only about five percent [shatkara&#x301;]. Incidentally, the English equivalent of the Bengali word shatkara&#x301; is &ldquo;percent&rdquo;. The word is originally Latin-French, thus its French pronunciation is pa&#x301;rsa&#x301;n. People have altered its pronunciation in English to &ldquo;percent&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The word &ldquo;Tamil&rdquo; comes from the word dra&#x301;vid&#x301; &ndash; dra&#x301;vid&#x301; &rarr; dra&#x301;mid&#x301; &rarr; dra&#x301;mil &rarr; ta&#x301;mil. The Kuruk language of the Ora&#x301;ons of northern India&#146;s Chottanagpur is also a Dravidian language. Baluchistan&#146;s Baluch and Brahui (Brohii) are Dravidian languages as well. They also use many Sanskrit words.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Among the languages of the Aryan language group of north India, Oriya and Bengali are the most closely related. Going north from Andra Pradesh up to Orissa&#146;s Ganjam District one sees a great influence of Telegu. After that Oriyan influence begins. Bengali begins from the middle of Orissa&#146;s Baleshvar and Dantan. Oriya is an Aryan-group language while Telegu and Tamil are non-Aryan languages. All the Aryan languages depend on prefixes and suffixes while this is less true with the Dravidian languages. They can create many words without the help of prefixes or suffixes.<!-- /block --></p>

Aurangzeb gave mango the Sanskrit name sudha&#x301;rasa. Sanskrit has two words, a&#x301;mra and a&#x301;mla. There is a Sanskrit rule, ra-layorabhedah in which ra and la are interchangeable; both ra and la are pronounced. It was sour, or amla, hence it was called a&#x301;mla. Afterwards it became a&#x301;mra. For example, roma &ndash; loma [wool], rohita &ndash; lohita [red] &ndash; both are used. Neither amla nor a&#x301;mra lacks a suffix. Ra and la are both suffixes. This characteristic is also quite noticeable in French as well as in Bengali, Gujarati and other languages.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="8..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->The tendency to use prefixes, root verbs and suffixes is bound to remain in those languages which use Sanskrit words, even if they are not descended from Sanskrit. The same holds true for the Dravidian languages. Italian, French and Spanish use prefixes and suffixes the same way that Latin does. The Latin language is very close to Sanskrit. The Latin word &ldquo;fraternity&rdquo; is formed by adding the suffix &ldquo;nity&rdquo; to the root word &ldquo;frater&rdquo;. Latin frater, Vedic bhra&#x301;tar, Laokika Sanskrit bhra&#x301;ta&#x301;; Latin mater, Vedic ma&#x301;tar, French mere, English &ldquo;mother&rdquo;, Bengali ma&#x301;ta&#x301;; Latin pater, Farsi pedar, French p re, Vedic pitar, Sanskrit pita&#x301;, Bengali pita&#x301;, English &ldquo;father&rdquo;.

In Bengali at&#x301; comes from as&#x301;t&#x301;a [eight]. &ldquo;November&rdquo; comes from nova [nine] and &ldquo;December&rdquo; comes from deca [ten].

<a name="8..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Let us talk about suffixes. A suffix is an activized faculty. When an activized faculty is endowed with the qualities of the original root verb it is known as a suffix. As with Sanskrit, Bengali has its own suffixes. Sometimes a vowel is pronounced one way when one suffix is added and a different way when a different suffix is added. Take, for example, the Hindi word lar&#x301;ka&#x301; (here the r&#x301;a [lar&#x301;ka&#x301;] is pronounced with a hasanta). If the suffix pan is added then the pronunciation changes to lad&#x301;akpan (lar&#x301;akpan). If the suffix ii is added to the Bengali word chelema&#x301;nus&#x301; it becomes chelema&#x301;nus&#x301;ii but it can also be chelema&#x301;ns&#x301;ii. Here the na is pronounced with a hasanta. Thus a small change occurs in the verb and noun when the suffix is added. They become transformed into the different verb forms and adverbs. Those who understand acoustics know that this happens due to suffixes. &ldquo;Sub + fix = suffix&rdquo;. Here &ldquo;sub&rdquo; is a Latin prefix. The English synonyms for &ldquo;sub&rdquo; are &ldquo;behind&rdquo;, &ldquo;under&rdquo;, &ldquo;below&rdquo;, &ldquo;beneath&rdquo;, etc. The word &ldquo;be&rdquo; means &ldquo;nearby&rdquo;; &ldquo;hind&rdquo; means &ldquo;that which is hidden&rdquo;. Thus &ldquo;behind&rdquo; means &ldquo;that which is hidden nearby&rdquo;. Many people mistakenly pronounce the word &ldquo;behind&rdquo; as biha&#x301;in&#x301;d&#x301;. It should be either beha&#x301;in&#x301;d or baha&#x301;in&#x301;d&#x301;. The suffix is hidden behind the word or the verbal root. One whose existence or expression is subservient to another is a subject. If the suffix &ldquo;ive&rdquo; is added to &ldquo;subject&rdquo; it becomes &ldquo;subjective&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->When a suffix is used to indicate number then changes also occur in the verb. For example, &ldquo;medium&rdquo; is singular but the plural is &ldquo;media&rdquo;. Likewise the singular &ldquo;radius&rdquo; is &ldquo;radii&rdquo; in the plural and the singular &ldquo;memo&rdquo; is &ldquo;mema&rdquo; in the plural. The Latin &ldquo;terrain&rdquo; is &ldquo;terranean&rdquo; as an adjective. In English it means &ldquo;earth&rdquo; and in Bengali mat&#x301;i. That which is in the middle of the earth is &ldquo;medi-terranean&rdquo;. In precisely the same way the Latin prefix &ldquo;sub&rdquo; is used to mean &ldquo;beneath&rdquo; or &ldquo;below&rdquo; or &ldquo;under something or someone&rdquo;. We say &ldquo;underground&rdquo; in English to mean &ldquo;beneath the soil&rdquo; (this is a compound word). Its Latin synonym is &ldquo;subterranean&rdquo;. In ordinary English we can say &ldquo;underground room&rdquo; while in refined English we can say &ldquo;subterranean chamber&rdquo;. Of course, the word &ldquo;chamber&rdquo; is not originally English; it comes from the French word chambre. People who did not know French mistakenly began pronouncing it cemba&#x301;r.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->I pointed out that by adding the suffix a change in pronunciation occurs.

<a name="8..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Changes in pronunciation when suffixes are employed happen in all languages except for Sanskrit. Of course, there is a corresponding change in pronunciation in Sanskrit when there is a change in spelling. For example, ap + ja = abja; va&#x301;k + bhava = va&#x301;gbhava; va&#x301;k + maya = va&#x301;unmaya; ya&#x301;c + na&#x301; = ya&#x301;cina&#x301; (the na is transformed into palatal na)). Sanskrit is a language in which pronunciation is inextricably tied to spelling. It is pronounced just as it is spelt while in all other languages the pronunciation undergoes changes. For example, in Hindi we write maem&#x301;, we read mya&#x301;ny; we write mem&#x301;; we read men. In Bengali also we do not always pronounce something the way we write it. For example, we write se ha&#x301;sche [he is laughing] but we pronounce it se ha&#x301;nsche, that is, we add a candrabindu to the pronunciation of ha&#x301;sche. Conversely, in Sanskrit we pronounce sah hasati just as it is written, not sah ha&#x301;nsati. In Hindi it is both written and read with the candrabindu, for example, hans raha&#x301; hae.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->In English also the pronunciation changes. The English word &ldquo;housewife&rdquo; has two different pronunciations with different meanings. When &ldquo;housewife&rdquo; is pronounced &ldquo;huzif&rdquo; it means &ldquo;that in which odds and ends are kept&rdquo;, and when it is pronounced &ldquo;housewife&rdquo; then it means &ldquo;the mistress of the house&rdquo;. The English word &ldquo;Sandwich&rdquo; is not pronounced &ldquo;sand &ndash; wich&rdquo;, but rather sandich. Similarly &ldquo;Greenwich&rdquo; is pronounced grenich. &ldquo;Gloucester&rdquo; is not pronounced glaces&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301;r but glas&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301;r. &ldquo;Pall-mall&rdquo; is pronounced pel-mel rather than pal-mal. &ldquo;Viscount&rdquo; is pronounced va&#x301;ika&#x301;un&#x301;t&#x301;. &ldquo;Lieutenant&rdquo; is pronounced left&#x301;enya&#x301;n&#x301;t&#x301;, &ldquo;colonel&rdquo; is karnel. We write &ldquo;parliament&rdquo; but we read it pa&#x301;rlimen&#x301;t&#x301;; we write &ldquo;government&rdquo; but say gabhmen&#x301;t&#x301;; we write &ldquo;party&rdquo; but say pa&#x301;-a&#x301;-a&#x301;-t&#x301;i; similarly we write &ldquo;forty&rdquo; and say fa-a-a-t&#x301;i, and so on.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Bengali is a living language. It has many suffixes of its own. For example: giri &ndash; da&#x301;da&#x301;giri; pana&#x301; &ndash; belella&#x301;pana&#x301;; iya&#x301; &ndash; ha&#x301;-bha&#x301;tiya&#x301; &rarr; ha&#x301;bha&#x301;te; ila&#x301; &ndash; a&#x301;-dekhila&#x301; &rarr; a&#x301;-dekhle. English also has these kinds of suffixes but most of its suffixes are taken from Latin. The native English suffixes &ldquo;ing&rdquo; and &ldquo;ed&rdquo; do not come from Latin &ndash; they are native English. It should be borne in mind that when &ldquo;ed&rdquo; is added to a noun it forms an adjective and when it is added to a verb it creates a gerund or a verbal adjective. However there is a difference in pronunciation. For example, when &ldquo;ed&rdquo; is added to the root verb &ldquo;learn&rdquo; to form an adjective then it is pronounced la&#x301;rned and when it becomes a verbal adjective then it is pronounced la&#x301;rnd. Similar is the case with &ldquo;loved&rdquo; (la&#x301;bhd&#x301; &ndash; verb) and &ldquo;beloved&rdquo; (bila&#x301;bhed&#x301; &ndash; verbal adjective). In Sanskrit, on the other hand, this does not happen. Sanskrit is pronounced exactly as it is written. For example, if the suffix kta is added to a word the varga will change but the pronunciation will not &ndash; muc + kta = mukta, not muckta. Here the ca varga is changed into ka varga. In English it changes sometimes and sometimes it does not. The English word &ldquo;conjunction&rdquo; has three parts: the prefix &ldquo;con&rdquo;, the root verb &ldquo;junct&rdquo; and the suffix &ldquo;ion&rdquo;. Here the pronunciation becomes kanja&#x301;m&#x301;sha&#x301;n instead of kanja&#x301;nt&#x301;iyan when the suffix &ldquo;ion&rdquo; is added. Similar is the case with &ldquo;connection&rdquo;, &ldquo;option&rdquo;, &ldquo;conjunctivitis&rdquo;, and so on. The word &ldquo;conjunctivitis&rdquo; means &ldquo;that disease which infects another individual if they remain nearby&rdquo;. However in the case of &ldquo;question&rdquo; the pronunciation is questiyan rather than queschen.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->These changes in the pronunciation of the word occur due to the addition of the suffix. However hardly any change occurs when the prefix is added. This should be borne in mind. The spelling mistakes that people make are generally due to the addition of the suffix, not the prefix. Thus if very big words are to be spelled correctly then the word should be broken down into its three component parts &ndash; prefix, root verb and suffix, for example &ndash; &ldquo;preposition&rdquo;. Here there are three parts &ndash; &ldquo;pre&rdquo;, &ldquo;posit&rdquo; and &ldquo;ion&rdquo;, that is, prefix, root verb and suffix. This breaking it down into its three parts affords little scope for spelling errors while writing a word.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->If the Bengali word samabhivya&#x301;ha&#x301;ra is broken down into its respective parts &ndash; sam (prefix) &ndash; abhi (prefix) &ndash; vi (prefix) &ndash; a&#x301; (prefix) &ndash; hr (root verb) + ghain&#x32D; (suffix) &ndash; then there is no scope for error. It is ineffectual to try to remember the spelling of the word &ldquo;assassination&rdquo; by trying to remember &ldquo;ass&rdquo; after &ldquo;ass&rdquo; then &ldquo;i&rdquo; then &ldquo;nation&rdquo;. So if one wants to know the spelling of a word then one should know the prefix, root verb and suffix. Some other examples are &ldquo;correlated&rdquo;, &ldquo;corrected&rdquo;, etc. The &ldquo;r&rdquo; is doubled in the word &ldquo;corrected&rdquo; because of the light vowel. In Sanskrit also the letter following a light vowel is doubled.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->There is an observable difference between Sanskrit and Bengali that can be attributed to the use of suffixes.

Another similar non-Sanskrit word is anushiilana. The word anushiilana has been derived by adding the suffix anat&#x301; to anu-shiil. This word has been forcibly introduced into Sanskrit. Actually, it is a native Bengali word. The native Sanskrit synonym for anushiilana is gaves&#x301;an&#x301;a&#x301;.

In former times, teachers used to send their students into the forest in search of lost cows. They would find the cows after expending a lot of effort in the deep forest. Similarly, if one wants to learn about a subject in detail in the modern era then one will have to put a lot of effort into research. Thus the word gaves&#x301;an&#x301;a&#x301; is used to indicate hard and strenuous research.

The word parn&#x301;asha&#x301;la&#x301; means &ldquo;a hut thatched with mature leaves&rdquo;, that is, a thatch-roof house. Na&#x301;gaballarii is called na&#x301;garbilli or na&#x301;garbel in western India. There is no Vedic Sanskrit word for begun [brinjal].

The Bengali word pallii [small village] is also a Tamil word, not Sanskrit. In northern India one kind of luci [a deep-fried unleavened bread] is called puri. Puri is not a Sanskrit word.

There is a different reason why what we call a&#x301;m in Bengali is called &ldquo;mango&rdquo; in English. Once there was a gentleman by the name of Mr. Ricecurry who came to work in this country during the rule of the East India Company. He was the first English gentleman to bring his wife here with him.

After Mr. Ricecurry returned to his own country his wife committed suicide in a woeful turn of events. Mr. Ricecurry then wrote to a friend of his in India about his wife&#146;s death and used the word &ldquo;suttee&rdquo;, meaning satii, for her death. From then on the word &ldquo;suttee&rdquo; found a place in the English language.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->The word yavana means &ldquo;one who does not follow the Aryan customs&rdquo;. Yavana&#146;s wife was Yavanii and his daughter was Yavanika&#x301;. Sanskrit dramas begin with a kushiilava and end with a yavanika&#x301;. Two very young boys (as if they were Kusha and Lava) used to come out at the beginning of the drama and acquaint the audience with the drama&#146;s name and with the actors and the actresses. At the end of the drama two yavanika&#x301; girls would come onto the stage and announce the conclusion of the drama. Due to this, the word yavanika&#x301; came to be used in Bengali drama for the conclusion.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->Many words have entered Bengali in this way. Many of them, perhaps, cannot be traced through research. It would be futile to look for their prefix, root verb or suffix. Still it is good that these words be included in the language. It will not do to exclude any such word. Nowadays the Urdu word samjhaota [mutual understanding] is quite prevalent in Bengali. The equivalent Bengali word is bojha&#x301;par&#x301;a&#x301; but many people use the word samjhaota more. Many words have entered the language in this way and more will do so in the future. It is only proper to allow in those words that are yet to come. With the judgement of time those which will stay will stay and those which will go will go. A forcible attempt to confine a language will do harm to that language. Languages develop through this linguistic interchange so they must proceed ahead through interchange so that they can advance.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="9..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Many people have the conception that the language of a tribe is a dialect. In Hindi it is called boli. Many persons call or used to call dialects bha&#x301;kha&#x301; (not as Yajurvedic pronunciation) out of contempt. Kabir has said: Sam&#x301;skrta ku&#x301;podaka bha&#x301;kha&#x301; bahata&#x301; niir &ndash; in other words, the Sanskrit language is like stagnant well water and the people&#146;s language is like the flowing water of a river, that is, full of vitality. This people&#146;s language proceeds forward and moves on while the so-called refined languages, bound by the fetters of rules and regulations, dos and don&#146;ts, modestly and tremblingly move ahead at a snail&#146;s pace. A few hundred years ago the Yajurvedic style of pronunciation was still in vogue in the Aryan languages of north India. S&#x301;a used to be pronounced like kha. Even today the word ks&#x301;ama is pronounced khama&#x301; in Panjabi.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The point is, wherein lies the essential difference between a language and a dialect? Every dialect comes within the periphery of one language or another. Actually a language is the conglomerate of a certain number of dialects. The substance of the matter is that under no circumstances do we have the right to turn up our nose at a dialect, considering it to be unrefined or deprived of a glorious lineage. Even if its lineage has no glory or has disappeared, from the existential point of view it is worthy enough. Often we can become acquainted with the nature of the movement of more than one language through the study of a particular dialect. Take, for example, the &ldquo;Kacchii&rdquo; language. Gujarati comes from Ma&#x301;lavii Pra&#x301;krta and Sindhii comes from Pahlavii Pra&#x301;krta. This Kacchii language or dialect is a sweet blending of the Gujarati and Sindhii languages. We can easily understand or become familiar with the natural differences between Gujarati and Sindhii through the study of Kacchii. Similarly, when we travel from Kishanganj to Purnia we come across an area whose language is called Shiripuriya&#x301; (Shriipuriya&#x301;). It has arisen as a mixture of Bengali and Angika. In the area lying between Bokaro and Hazaribagh we find Khot&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301; Bengali which is a mixture of Bengali and Magahii. If one goes from Haludpukur towards Ba&#x301;ripada&#x301; the linguistic river basin that one comes across on both banks is known as Kera&#x301; Bengali. In this Kera&#x301; Bengali we find a peculiar union between northern Oriya and Rarhi Bengali. In Bengali we say a&#x301;mi jete pa&#x301;rba na&#x301; [I will not be able to go]; in Kera&#x301; Bengali one says mui ja&#x301;itye pa&#x301;rim na&#x301;i. If you travel still further east it becomes a&#x301;mi jete pa&#x301;rbuni. This spoken language continues up to Uluberia. This is called a &ldquo;dialect&rdquo;. In Oriya, if the first person singular is pa&#x301;ribi then the plural form is pa&#x301;ribu, however in Kera&#x301; Bengali there is no difference between the singular and the plural.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="9..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->12) Chittagong Bengali: All of Chittagong District except for the southern areas and some parts of Noakhali District.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->As I said before, most languages have dialects. It must be borne in mind that not all the languages of particular tribes or communities are dialects; some of them are separate languages also. It is perfectly acceptable to entitle the language of five hundred people as a full-fledged language. By the same token the language of a million or more people may be considered a dialect.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Now the question arises &ndash; what is the fundamental difference between a language and a dialect? Roughly speaking there are eight conditions that must be fulfilled in order to be considered a language, much like an eight-legged cot. These eight are: 1) own vocabulary, 2) pronouns, 3) verb-endings, 4) case-endings, 5) oral or written literature, 6) style of intonation, 7) psycho-acoustic and inferential acoustic notes, and 8) syntax.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph --><b>Vocabulary</b>: The meaning of vocabulary [shabda sambha&#x301;ra] is &ldquo;a collection of words&rdquo;. Every language has to have its own vocabulary. Now, how do words come into existence? In the beginning, unrefined verbs were fashioned from qualitative sounds. Nouns, adjectives and the different verbal expressions &ndash; prefixes and suffixes &ndash; were created from verbs after the refinement of those first verb forms. Pronouns and indeclinables were not created from verbs. They were produced from psycho-acoustic notes. In English, indeclinables are commonly called prepositions and conjunctions. Apart from this, the word &ldquo;do&rdquo; in English is often used in place of a specific verb. For example: &ldquo;As I see, so I do&rdquo;. Instead of using the verb &ldquo;see&rdquo; a second time, &ldquo;do&rdquo; performs its function. The old English grammarians used to consider this &ldquo;do&rdquo; to be a &ldquo;pro-verb&rdquo; but nowadays it is no longer considered as such. Anyhow, both pronouns and indeclinables come from acoustic notes. A&#x301;mi [I], tumi [you (familiar)] and a&#x301;pani [you (respectful)] come from a&#x301;hme, tuhme and appana. There is a Buddhist lyric written about twelve hundred years ago in which we find these lines:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..19"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->A&#x301;hme n&#x301;a ja&#x301;nahun acinta joi<br>Ja&#x301;ma maran&#x301;a bhava kaisana hoi<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..20"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->[When there is no existence of bhava the idea of birth and death is confusing. We do not understand that entity which is beyond the concept of duality.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->Vocabulary is created from psycho-acoustic notes and inferential acoustic notes. For example, the vibration created when a person&#146;s eyes come in contact with something white is similar to words such as dhapdhap [white, bright]. From this comes the expression dhavdhave sa&#x301;da&#x301; [bright white]. Ka&#x301;n kat&#x301;kat&#x301; karche [The ear is throbbing &ndash; literally &ldquo;doing kat&#x301;kat&#x301;&rdquo;]. Now is the ear here actually doing kat&#x301; kat&#x301; kat&#x301; kat&#x301;? No, rather the vibration in the nerves is similar to the sound kat&#x301; kat&#x301;; from this evolved the word kat&#x301;kat&#x301;. Thus we see that in the beginning there is a sound denoting a certain quality and from that the word is created.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->The size or measurement of a vocabulary does not remain static. As a result of mutual interchange and mixing between people, words from the vocabulary of one region enter the vocabulary of another. Many Arabic, Farsi, Turkish, English, Portuguese and French words have entered Bengali in this way. It is futile to try to keep these words out, nor is there anything to be gained by it.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->The meaning of the English word &ldquo;head&rdquo; is ma&#x301;tha&#x301;. One whose head is confused or has had their head turned is often called be-hed. The be of behed is a Farsi prefix and hed is an English word. Similar is the case with the word jimkha&#x301;na&#x301;. The word jim comes from the English word &ldquo;game&rdquo; and the Farsi suffix kha&#x301;na&#x301; has been added to it. In this way the word gemkha&#x301;na&#x301; became jemkha&#x301;na&#x301; and in subsequent times it was transformed into jimkha&#x301;na&#x301;. In Arabic the pronunciation of ga and ja can be substituted for each other. For example, gawa&#x301;hir &rarr; jawa&#x301;hir.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->A word that is very well known to us is a&#x301;ta&#x301; [custard-apple]. Many people believe that a&#x301;ta&#x301; may be a Bengali word but actually it is not. The Portuguese first planted the a&#x301;ta&#x301; tree when they came to Bandel about four hundred and fifty years ago. A&#x301;ta&#x301; is a Portuguese word.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->The Bengali word aca&#x301;ra [pickle] comes from the Portuguese word aca&#x301;r. In Sanskrit there is a word a&#x301;ca&#x301;ra that means &ldquo;behaviour&rdquo;. The Portuguese brought their fruit aca&#x301;r to this country and it became a&#x301;ca&#x301;r in Bengali &ndash; for example, mango aca&#x301;ra, tamarind a&#x301;ca&#x301;r, and so on.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->In this way a vocabulary grows through the give and take of words between languages. Having one&#146;s own vocabulary is one special characteristic of a language. In a dialect the vocabulary is very small and in some very poor dialects it practically does not exist at all.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->Now a language&#146;s vocabulary provides a mirror that reflects just how far any particular community has progressed in this world in terms of human culture and human civilization. There are some communities whose language contains only about eight hundred and fifty words while the language of highly developed apes contains around seven hundred and fifty words. Hence there is very little difference between the vocabulary of the least advanced human communities and the most highly advanced ape communities. Even bird languages have their own vocabulary. If birds are eating rice and by chance a person happens by then one bird will start calling out ka, ka which means &ldquo;flee, flee&rdquo; and they all fly away. Birds and animals have vocabulary but not verbs.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->Bengali has approximately 125,000 words. From the standpoint of vocabulary this is a matter of pride, however, Sanskrit, Latin, English, French and German have much larger vocabularies. Hence there is a need to further enrich the Bengali vocabulary. For that new words will have to be created. In one Prabhat Samgiita song the word pra&#x301;vrt&#x301; has been used to mean &ldquo;heavy rains&rdquo;. The word pra&#x301;vrt&#x301; is originally a Vedic word that is no longer in use. Not only does the language become sweeter by using this word but the vocabulary is also increased. This vocabulary is one of the prerequisites for being considered a language.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->Another thing to be considered in the case of vocabulary is the use of nominal verbs. Although these nominal verbs are verb forms they are created by making a word causative (according to the Sanskrit rule, nominal verbal roots follow the a&#x301;tmanepadii conjugation). For example, se gaya&#x301;y ner&#x301;a&#x301;te giyechila [He went to Gaya for a shave]. Here ner&#x301;a&#x301; hate is understood, thus ner&#x301;a&#x301;te is a nominal verb. The village people of Burdwan say se kabla&#x301;cche na&#x301;, that is, se kabul karche na&#x301; [he doesn&#146;t admit]. Here kabla&#x301;cche is a nominal verb. An example from Sanskrit is sah ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yate (a&#x301;tmanepadii), that is, &ldquo;he is repeating &lsquo;Ra&#x301;m, Ra&#x301;m&rsquo;.&rdquo; Here ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yate is a nominal verb. Niraste pa&#x301;dape deshe eran&#x301;d&#x301;o&#146;pi druma&#x301;yate. It means: Even the castor oil plant becomes a great tree where there are no other big plants. The meaning of druma&#x301;yate is druma druma iti karoti. Here druma&#x301;yate is a nominal verb.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->The use of nominal verbs is not very common in Bengali, however one Bengali writer who did use nominal verbs extensively was Michael Madhusudan Dutta. Pravesh karila&#x301; &rarr; praveshila&#x301;; a&#x301;rambha karila&#x301; &rarr; a&#x301;rambhila&#x301;. Michael used these and other verbals quite often in his poetic compositions. Nominal verbs are also used in Hindi. For example, the Hindi equivalent of the Bengali a&#x301;ma&#x301;ke khub dhikka&#x301;r diyechila [He scolded me roundly] is mujhe dhikra&#x301;ya&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->Anyhow, the use of nominal verbs enriches a language&#146;s vocabulary. In India there are many languages which are called dialects but which, when considered from the point of view of vocabulary, certainly deserve more respect.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph --><b>Pronouns</b>: All languages have their own pronouns. Pronouns, such as the Bengali pronouns a&#x301;mi, tumi and a&#x301;pani, are created from psycho-acoustic notes. English has the pronouns &ldquo;thou&rdquo;, &ldquo;you&rdquo;, and so forth, while in Bengali the pronouns o, uni, ini are used when the person is present and se, tini, jini when the person is not present. Formerly &ldquo;thou&rdquo; was used in English when the person was present and &ldquo;you&rdquo; when the person was not present. In Rarhi Bengali se and tini are not currently used. In Rarhi Bengali one says: u ki ballek, u kutha&#x301;ke ja&#x301;bek, and so on. No language can be considered a separate language if it does not have its own pronouns. The language-ness of the language would cease to exist. Hence pronouns are very important from the standpoint of linguistic recognition.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->All the languages which were recognized by the Indian constitution have their own pronouns and many of the languages which were not accepted also have their own pronouns, for example, Angika, Maethilii, Magahii,  Bhojpuri, Chattishgarii, etc. Although these languages are not recognized in India by the constitution, they deserve recognition and should be recognized. From the standpoint of linguistics they should be accepted as languages.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->Bengali is an independent language. It has had its own pronouns for the past twelve hundred years. There is an early Buddhist lyric:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..35"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->Appan&#x301;e raci raci bhavanirva&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;<br>Micha&#x301; loye vandha&#x301;boye apan&#x301;a&#x301;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..36"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph -->[Usually people under the influence of avidya&#x301; (ignorance) confuse bhava and nirva&#x301;n&#x301;a but in reality the idea of dualism is misleading.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..37"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=37 type=paragraph -->Appane raci raci means &ldquo;composing one&#146;s self&rdquo;. The Sanskrit third person singular bhava&#x301;n became appan in old Bengali &ndash; in modern Bengali a&#x301;pana &rarr; a&#x301;pni. The Sanskrit second person singular tvam became tuhme and the Sanskrit first person singular aham became a&#x301;hme from which comes the modern Bengali a&#x301;mi &ndash; aham &rarr; ahammi &rarr; a&#x301;hmi &rarr; a&#x301;hme &rarr; a&#x301;mi. Aham, bhava&#x301;n and tvam have all developed from psycho-acoustic notes. There is a thirteen hundred year old Bengali verse:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..38"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=38 type=paragraph -->Etaka&#x301;la ha&#x301;nu acchila samohe<br>Eve mai vujhilon guru sambohe<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="9..45"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=45 type=paragraph --><b>Verb-endings</b>: Verb-endings are one of the eight prerequisites for being a language. In Sanskrit lat&#146;, lot&#146;, laun, vidhiliun, lrt&#x301;, etc. are examples of different verb-endings. However, Sanskrit does not have a present continuous tense while most of the Indian languages do. The Hindi equivalent for &ldquo;is doing&rdquo; is kar raha&#x301; hae and the equivalent of &ldquo;does&rdquo; is karta&#x301; hae. However in Sanskrit karoti or kurute are used to signify both &ldquo;is doing&rdquo; and &ldquo;does&rdquo;. Some pandits are partial to using kurvannasti to indicate the continuous tense of the verb. In the material world what is uninterrupted or continuous is called &ldquo;contiguous&rdquo; and in the world of ideas the word &ldquo;continuity&rdquo; is used. For example, &ldquo;Calcutta has territorial contiguity with Diamond Harbour&rdquo;. &ldquo;Continuity&rdquo; indicates an abstract idea. For example, after one person gives a speech, another person is giving a speech. Here the word kurvannasti can be used to indicate &ldquo;is giving&rdquo;. For &ldquo;is swimming across&rdquo; we can use either tarati or tarannasti, however in this case the fundamental mental idea is not properly expressed. Thus in Bengali separate verb forms &ndash; kare, karche, kare caleche, etc. &ndash; are used. Hence in this respect Bengali is more expressive than Sanskrit. Bengali has its own speciality when it comes to linguistic continuity or material contiguity. In all the Indian languages that have developed from Pra&#x301;krta we find greater or lesser use of a kind of sonorous word form to indicate the indicative, continuous tense. This is worth noting. For example, kariteche, karta&#x301; hae, karaita achi, kareiche, karuchi, kardii hae, and so on. The fundamental unity of these languages is expressed through these verb-endings. They also demonstrate that these languages come from the same source. From the verb-endings one can determine which language has developed from which Pra&#x301;krta. This can be shown through examples of verb-endings. For example:<!-- /block --></p>

Banerji he called Mr. G. C. Banerji and said: &ldquo;Look, my good man, why did you spell this with two &lsquo;t&#x301;s&#146;?&rsquo;&rdquo; Mr. G. C. Banerji replied in a grave manner: &ldquo;Sir, you finished your studies quite a long time ago, didn&#146;t you? So perhaps you have forgotten a few of the rules. The rule is that if a single consonant is preceded by a single vowel then the consonant is doubled when a suffix is added. Based on the accepted rule I have written two &lsquo;t&#146;s&rsquo;&rdquo;. In reply the witty Mr. S. P. Banerji said: &ldquo;See here, my good man, whatever the rule may be, you&#146;ve done well to write two &lsquo;t&#146;s&rsquo;. The letter is going from Tatanagar to Calcutta. Kharagpur is on the way. Nowadays there have been a lot of train robberies in Kharagpur. So if the robbers steal one of the &lsquo;t&#146;s&rsquo; then there will still be one &lsquo;t&rsquo; left.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..88"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=88 type=paragraph -->Generally the letter &ldquo;g&rdquo; is pronounced like &ldquo;j&rdquo; when it is followed by &ldquo;e&rdquo;, &ldquo;i&rdquo; or &ldquo;y&rdquo;. Elsewhere it is a hard &ldquo;g&rdquo; sound. Similarly &ldquo;c&rdquo; is pronounced like &ldquo;s&rdquo; when it is followed by &ldquo;e&rdquo;, &ldquo;i&rdquo; or &ldquo;y&rdquo; and elsewhere like &ldquo;k&rdquo;. The word &ldquo;jail&rdquo; has two accepted spellings in English &ndash; &ldquo;jail&rdquo; and &ldquo;gaol&rdquo;. In the latter, however, the &ldquo;g&rdquo; is not followed by &ldquo;e&rdquo;, &ldquo;i&rdquo; or &ldquo;y&rdquo; but by &ldquo;a&rdquo;. Nevertheless it is pronounced like a &ldquo;j&rdquo;. This is also an exception.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..89"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=89 type=paragraph -->Under normal conditions the English word &ldquo;full&rdquo; is spelled with two &ldquo;l&#146;s&rdquo;, but if it forms the second half of a compound word then it has one &ldquo;l&rdquo;, that is, &ldquo;ful&rdquo;, for example, &ldquo;beautiful&rdquo;, &ldquo;handful&rdquo;, etc. In such a case this occurs because the relative importance of its pronunciation is lessened. Thus this will have to be accepted as a rule rather than an exception.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..90"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=90 type=paragraph -->Many people mistakenly say that the English language does not have any rules and regulations. Such a conception is altogether false. There is a clear and elegant reply as to why &ldquo;but&rdquo; and &ldquo;put&rdquo; are pronounced differently. The word &ldquo;but&rdquo; is of Anglo-Saxon origin, thus the &ldquo;u&rdquo; is pronounced like ay, for example, &ldquo;unfair&rdquo;, &ldquo;under&rdquo;, etc. The word &ldquo;put&rdquo; is of Norman origin. Here the pronunciation of &ldquo;u&rdquo; is more like ayu, for example, &ldquo;universal&rdquo;, &ldquo;unique&rdquo;, &ldquo;pecuniary&rdquo;, and so forth.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..91"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=91 type=paragraph -->Generally, things which do not grow in a certain country, or which are not available there, do not have names in the language of that country. Cherries do not grow in Bengal, thus there is no word for &ldquo;cherry&rdquo; in Bengali. Some things did not originally have a name but were given a name later on, for example, balga&#x301; harin&#x301; [reindeer], ut&#x301;pa&#x301;khii [ostrich], etc. Some people, in order to show up the weakness of English, point out that it does not have a word for pat&#x301;ol. This is incorrect. Although pat&#x301;ol does not grow in England, it does have an English name &ndash; &ldquo;wax gourd&rdquo; or &ldquo;squat gourd&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="10..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->In regard to the difference between a language and a dialect, I have stated that a language depends upon eight conditions, and of those eight, four were discussed. That leaves four more. They are: literature, intonation, psycho-acoustic and inferential acoustic notes, and syntax. The first of these to be discussed today will be literature.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Literature: A language must have its own literature in order to be a separate language. The English word &ldquo;literature&rdquo; comes from the Latin word liter which means &ldquo;brick&rdquo;. Long ago, before the advent of printing, separate letters used to be moulded from clay which was then fired like a brick. Just as companies stamp their name on their bricks when they are fired, alpha, beta, gamma, delta, omega, theta and other letters were fired like bricks, much like other work with fired clay. The handicraft that uses fired clay is called &ldquo;terracotta&rdquo; in English. The terracotta industry originated in Bankura District&#146;s Vishnupur. In this kind of industry the clay is first moulded and then fired. Then it is pasted in the temple with a mixture of lime and sugar. The handicraft of Vishnupur was copied by other places and so the industry spread.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->I was saying that these letters were fired like bricks and for that reason they were called liter in Latin. This is the origin of the English word &ldquo;later&rdquo;. When clay is fired it turns reddish, thus reddish soil is called &ldquo;laterite soil&rdquo;. Since the soil of Rarh is quite reddish it is called the &ldquo;land of laterite soil&rdquo; or ra&#x301;un&#x32D;ga&#x301;ma&#x301;t&#x301;ir desh.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Anyhow, the art that rose up on the basis of these letters is called &ldquo;literature&rdquo; in English.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->It should be mentioned that what is called sa&#x301;hitya is not identical or does not convey the same significance as the English word &ldquo;literature&rdquo;. There is a night and day difference between the two. Literature refers to that art form which is based on letters while sa&#x301;hitya is something altogether different. Simply being an art form based on letters does not qualify something to be called sa&#x301;hitya. For it to be sa&#x301;hitya it must imbibe the thought of welfare. Sa&#x301;hitya means hitena saha [with welfare]. In other words, if a piece of literature is not motivated by the thought of welfare then it cannot be classified as sa&#x301;hitya. For this reason the scope of literature is vaster than the scope of sa&#x301;hitya. Something which is created from language but which is not motivated by the thought of welfare may be considered to be literature but it cannot be considered to be sa&#x301;hitya. In simple terms, all sa&#x301;hitya is literature but not all literature is sa&#x301;hitya. It is a common error to consider the English word &ldquo;literature&rdquo; to be the equivalent of sa&#x301;hitya.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Those compositions which we call apasa&#x301;hitya come within the scope of literature but since they are not motivated by the thought of welfare they do not deserve to be called sa&#x301;hitya. Amongst English writers we find in Shakespeare an unprecedented fusion of literature and sa&#x301;hitya. Now in Keat&#146;s compositions do we find as much sa&#x301;hitya as we do literature? This is something for the scholars to decide. In Scott as well, how much of each one finds is something to think about. Kipling&#146;s compositions are more literature than sa&#x301;hitya. In Milton&#146;s compositions we find pure sa&#x301;hitya, although there is some literary value as well. There is a great sa&#x301;hityik quality in the works of George Bernard Shaw.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->However dazzling pure literature may be, it is transitory and cannot be called sa&#x301;hitya. Satyendranath Datta was a magician with metre. His works have more literary value than sa&#x301;hityik value. On the other hand, Rabindranath Tagore&#146;s compositions demonstrate an unprecedented blending of literature and sa&#x301;hitya. Valmiki&#146;s Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a has sa&#x301;hityik value but not as much literary value. His language is also not that developed. On the other hand, Vyasdeva&#146;s Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata is almost cent per cent sa&#x301;hitya but it has, by comparison, more literary value than the Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a. Kalidas&#146;s works have tremendous literary value but not as much sa&#x301;hityik value.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Thus it should be borne in mind every step of the way that literature and sa&#x301;hitya are not one and the same. No composition can be called sa&#x301;hitya if it is not motivated by the thought of welfare and from an erudite standpoint it must, perforce, be rejected. However as literature it certainly remains meaningful and valuable.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Wordsworth&#146;s compositions do not have that much literary value but they have great sa&#x301;hityik value. Romain Rolland&#146;s works have profound sa&#x301;hityik value, very lofty, but while their literary value cannot be sneezed at, they are not that wonderful.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Thus, whenever judging the compositions of a poet or a writer, rather than using the touchstone of the era or the environment, I would test them by using a measuring rod that will stand the test of time.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->The Sanskrit synonym for the English word &ldquo;letter&rdquo; is aks&#x301;ara. Aks&#x301;ara means &ldquo;that which is not ks&#x301;ara [perishable]&rdquo; or &ldquo;that which does not undergo destruction, which does not decay&rdquo;. In other words, that which is and will remain as it has been. Conversely, whatever is perishable or subject to decay will one day come to an end. In one verse of the Yajurveda it is said:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..12"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Ks&#x301;aram&#x301; pradha&#x301;namamrta&#x301;ks&#x301;aram&#x301; harah<br>Ks&#x301;ara&#x301;tmana&#x301; viishate deva ekah<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..13"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->[Prakrti is ever-waning and Purus&#x301;a is changeless and immortal. The Supreme Entity controls both Prakrti and Purus&#x301;a.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->It means that that which is born from prakrti is perishable and will gradually decay and come to an end, but that which is imperishable is eternal; it will never be destroyed. Whatever sound has been produced on this earth, whatever song has been sung, will continue to reverberate in the cosmic hub for infinite time. It has no end. No one will be able to check it. Therefore the first idea of humanism is that people must be allowed to speak freely. Unfortunately nowadays those anti-Neohumanistic theories which give indulgence to dogma are flourishing and thereby depriving people of their fundamental right of free speech. They are not fulfilling the first condition of human expression. This is a great tragedy.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->There are fifty letters in Sanskrit beginning with a and ending with ks&#x301;a. Since they are held together like a garland they are collectively called the aks&#x301;ama&#x301;la&#x301;, the garland of letters. Because this garland of letters is held together in this universe on the breast of Parama Purus&#x301;a through the dance of Parama&#x301; Prakrti, it is also called in philosophical language the rudra&#x301;ks&#x301;a. In the Atharvaveda one finds Bhadraka&#x301;lii [manifestation of the primordial force] holding the fifty letters [they are depicted as skulls]. She has forty-nine around her neck and one in her hand. Actually this is not the case. This conception reflects the ignorance of the common people. It is, in fact, the garland of letters. In former times people did not know how to write letters. Written letters had yet to be invented. Thus they tried to indicate them by drawing the mouth.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->I said earlier that that which is created based on bha&#x301;va is called sa&#x301;hitya, thus it is incorrect to teach small children that literature is called sa&#x301;hitya or that the English synonym for sa&#x301;hitya is literature. It is much better to admit ignorance in this case.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Now, no one can claim that what you call sa&#x301;hitya or what you call literature must be written down. If something had to be written to be considered sa&#x301;hitya then that would have eliminated the Rgveda and the Yajurveda from the list because in those days there was no written script. Pupils used to memorize what their masters said, thus another name for the Vedas is Shruti, that is, &ldquo;that which is learnt by hearing&rdquo;. Thus sa&#x301;hitya does not in any way mean that something has to be written down. Sa&#x301;hitya can be oral as well, and the Vedas are an example of this.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->For a long time people&#146;s minds were bound by the demons of superstition whenever any work was or was not done. Hence we see that even after the invention of written script people did not write down the Vedas and other scriptures. They believed that since their forefathers had not written down the Vedas then it would have been unjust and undesirable for them to write them down. Actually they conveniently forgot that written script had not been invented at that time. It was only later on, when the Kashmir pandits of northwest India began to write in Sa&#x301;rada&#x301; script that they realized the impossibility of committing the four Vedas to memory. Not only that, out of the 108 extant parts of the Vedas, fifty-two had vanished. Thus they decided to write down the Vedas thinking that if they delayed much longer the Vedas might all disappear. So they wrote down the remaining portions of the Vedas in Sa&#x301;rada&#x301; script. Those parts that had vanished were never written down and no matter how much effort is expended those lost portions will never be recovered.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->When it became impossible to memorize the four Vedas as a whole the pandits decided that it would work better if they committed a single Veda to memory instead of all four. Those who were able to memorize a single Veda were given the title Pa&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;eya (Pa&#x301;nr&#x301;e), that is, one who is a scholar (pandit) of one Veda.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.10.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#10.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> Those who were able to commit two Vedas to memory were called Dvivedii (Duve). Similarly, pandits of three Vedas were known as Trivedii (Tewa&#x301;rii) and pandits of all four Vedas were known as Caturvedii (Caove). Later on the Yajurveda became so big that it was divided into two parts, the Krs&#x301;n&#x301;ayajurveda and the Shuklayajurveda. Those who were pandits in the Shuklayajurveda were called Shukla (Shukul in the spoken language). In this way, when the Vedas grew beyond all capacity to memorize them, the pandits found themselves forced to give them a written form. Apart from this written form of the Vedas, the unwritten portion cannot be kept outside of the purview of sa&#x301;hitya. It must certainly be classified as oral sa&#x301;hitya.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Previously I stated that  Bhojpuri, Magahii, Chatrishgar&#x301;ii and other languages deserve to be accepted as full-fledged languages. From the standpoint of literature as well they certainly deserve to be considered separate languages because all of these languages have their own oral literature.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->Maethilii literature is nine hundred years old. There was a writer of Maethilii literature who predated Vidaypati. His name was Jyotiriishvara Thakur, the composer of the Varn&#x301;aratna&#x301;kara. He was the father of Maethilii literature. The pioneer of the Chatrishgar&#x301;ii language was Naval Sharma who wrote literature in that language. None of these languages is a dialect. If someone wants to undervalue them by calling them dialects then I would have to say that they have no acquaintance with learning no matter how much praise they might have received.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->English literature before the time of Alfred was oral. He encouraged written English literature and from his time onwards it began to flourish, therefore he is called the father of English literature. Hussain Shah can also be given the same appellation in Bengali literature because he was the first nawab in that old, dark era to encourage poets and writers to compose literature, and to have religious books such as the Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a, the Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata and the Bhagavatam translated into Bengali. Bengali literature existed before the time of Hussain Shah but there is no indication that it enjoyed any government acceptance. The epic poetry that was composed by order of the kings cannot be said to have enjoyed government acceptance because in most cases the kings used to financially support these works out of greed for their own fame. The Carya&#x301;pada (Carya&#x301;caryavinishcayah) is classified as sa&#x301;hitya and it is more than a thousand years old. Most of these works were composed between thirteen hundred and a thousand years ago. At the time that the Carya&#x301;padas were written, Bengal was under the influence of the Kalacakraya&#x301;na branch of Maha&#x301;ya&#x301;na Buddhism. The principal centre of the Kalacakraya&#x301;niis was Bajrayoginii village near Vikrampur in Dacca District. Anyhow, Bengali did not have any written literature before the Carya&#x301;padas because at that time Bengali was still rather limited. Moreover, in that era Demi-Ma&#x301;gadhii Pra&#x301;krta was still prevalent.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Demi-Ma&#x301;gadhii Pra&#x301;krta separated into two branches &ndash; eastern Demi-Ma&#x301;gadhii and western Demi-Ma&#x301;gadhii. The languages belonging to the eastern Demi-Ma&#x301;gadhii group are Bengali, Oriya, Assamese, Maethilii, Koshalii and Angika; those belonging to western Demi-Ma&#x301;gadhii are Magahii,  Bhojpuri, Na&#x301;gpurii (the language of western Ranchi) and Chatrishgar&#x301;ii. In eastern Demi-Ma&#x301;gadhii the verb-endings do not change according to number and gender. For example, Ra&#x301;m ja&#x301;cche [Ram is going] (singular) and Ta&#x301;ra&#x301; ja&#x301;cche [they are going] (plural). Here there is no difference in the verb-endings. Likewise with Ra&#x301;m ja&#x301;cche, Siita&#x301; ja&#x301;cche &ndash; here also there is no change in the verb-endings despite the difference in gender, that is, both use the same verb form. Of course, in Maethilii there are exceptions to this that have arisen in modern times. For example, Ra&#x301;m gela&#x301;h but Siita&#x301; geliih. As regards number, there is a difference in Oriya between the singular and the plural in the future tense of the first person. For example, the verb-ending for &ldquo;I am going&rdquo; is jibi in the singular but jibu in the plural. Magahii, despite being a western Demi-Ma&#x301;gadhii language, does not have any exception to this rule. In  Bhojpuri the masculine form is karata&#x301; while the feminine form becomes karatiya&#x301;. The masculine dil ca&#x301;hela&#x301; becomes a&#x301;tma&#x301; ca&#x301;helii in feminine gender. Similarly the masculine gaila becomes gelun in feminine gender.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->I was saying that something does not have to be written to be literature. Alongside the Carya&#x301;padas in old Bengali and the written literature of the middle ages, the pervasive oral unwritten literature that existed cannot be discounted. In fact, not only during the old and middle ages, but today as well, there is an oral literature sprinkled alongside the written literature. Such oral forms of literature as Tusu songs (western Rarh), Bha&#x301;du songs (eastern Rarh), Bhawaia (north Bengal), Bha&#x301;t&#x301;iya&#x301;li (southeast Bengal), A&#x301;ul (central Bengal), Baul (Rarh), Mu&#x301;rshida&#x301; (central Bengal), Sa&#x301;ri (Dacca, Pa&#x301;bna&#x301;), Ja&#x301;riga&#x301;n (Mymensing), Vratakatha&#x301;, Pa&#x301;nca&#x301;lii, lullabies, and so on, cannot be denied their right of admittance into the courtyard of literature. From the literary standpoint this oral literature must also be respected as literature, regardless of its tangibility or intangibility.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->Intonation: Every language has its own intonation or style of pronunciation, just as every dialect has more or less its own intonation. This changes from village to village, mile to mile. If one hears O man&#x301;i bha&#x301;t kha&#x301;va&#x301; na&#x301; one can understand where that language comes from.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->Earlier I was talking about King Alfred. During his time the educated English in the higher rungs of society preferred to study French. The study of French literature used to be a matter of pride. They used to go to Paris, France from time to time in order to perfect their French accent. There is a story connected with this. England&#146;s Henry the Eighth was an unruly king. Once he came to Paris with the queen. In Paris many kinds of covetable drinks were available, thus when they were in Paris his desire for drink naturally increased. One day, while under the influence of liquor, he beat the queen so mercilessly that one of her legs became practically crippled. For several days she was obliged to drag it behind her as she walked. When the time came they returned to London (In those days they did not call it London but rather Londre in the aristocratic French language). The residents of the city fell head over heels in the nooks and crannies of the royal residence trying to see whether or not the king and queen had brought back any new fashions from Paris. They saw [Princess] Elizabeth dragging her leg and thought perhaps that this kind of walk was some kind of ultra-modern French style. Women have one great quality; they can easily imitate others. Thus it happened that within three to four days most of the women in the aristocratic households were dragging their leg behind them when they walked and taking a lot of pride in it. It is not written in the histories whether they ever discovered what the real story was behind the queen dragging her leg when she walked. Elizabeth&#146;s style of walking while dragging her leg was called the &ldquo;Elizabethan gait&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->Anyhow the English used to study French but they used to feel difficulties becoming accustomed to the French style of pronunciation because in French there is no pronunciation of the t&#x301;a varga. In English the pronunciation of the t&#x301;a varga predominates and the use of the ta varga is practically nil.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.10.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#10.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> Young boys are called &ldquo;boy&rdquo; in English and garcon in French but at that time in London people preferred the word garcon. The &ldquo;c&rdquo; in French has two different pronunciations. Sometimes it is similar to la and sometimes closer to sha. By adding the cedilla the pronunciation falls somewhere between sa and sha. The English used to pronounce the French word restaurent as res&#x301;t&#x301;uren&#x301;t&#x301; (instead of restora&#x301;n) and the French word hospital as haspita&#x301;l (instead of apita&#x301;l). The reason is that the t&#x301;a varga is not pronounced in French while in English there is limited pronunciation of the ta varga. Thus the French word mesdames (meda&#x301;m) became mesdems in English. In this way the English could not escape the influence of English intonation while speaking French.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->Just as every language has its own intonation, so does every dialect. That intonation is captured in the various specific local pronunciations. For example, the pronunciations ja&#x301;ti pa&#x301;rla&#x301;m na&#x301;, kha&#x301;ti pa&#x301;rla&#x301;m na&#x301;, ca&#x301;d (ca&#x301;nd), pha&#x301;d (pha&#x301;nd), and so on, indicate that it is the language of Jessore. There is a special type of intonation in the Gambhiira&#x301; songs of Maldah District. When Indians speak English there is a different pronunciation in each area according to the influence of the locality. The influence of Bengali intonation is clearly evident when Bengalees speak English. &ldquo;Giva me a glassa of watera&rdquo; &ndash; you will hear this kind of pronunciation and by hearing it you can tell that this is the influence of a certain local area. If someone who is not accustomed to speaking Calcutta Bengali wants to speak it then there will be a definite difference in their pronunciation. Once a certain gentleman from Burdwan was speaking with a gentleman from Calcutta in very good Calcutta Bengali but when the word kya&#x301;nda&#x301;i came out of his mouth he gave away that he was not actually from Calcutta at all. Once a Bihari gentleman was standing in front of a betel shop in Lucknow and said dot&#x301;ho pa&#x301;nka&#x301; khili dijiye [give me a couple of khilis (betel leaf with lime, catechu and betel-nut folded inside)]. What he should have said was do khiliya&#x301;n dija&#x301;nye. When the betel seller gave him his betel he said &ndash; do khiliya&#x301;n li ja&#x301;nye, &ldquo;t&#x301;ho&rdquo; udha&#x301;r milega&#x301; [here are your two khiliya&#x301;n, the &ldquo;t&#x301;ho&rdquo; you will get over there]. When an Englishman speaks Hindi he finds himself unable to avoid the influence of his own language&#146;s intonation. He says eya&#x301; mya&#x301;n, t&#x301;um kid&#x301;ha&#x301;r hyay, pa&#x301;ni car&#x301;a&#x301;o. Mistaken pronunciation is a social offence because successive mistakes in the pronunciation of a word or words become widespread in the society and lead to the distortion of a language. Thus teachers should exercise extreme caution in this regard, otherwise their poor pronunciation will have an undesirable effect on their students and millions will suffer for it.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->The intonation of a particular language should be mastered for that language. In Sanskrit the pronunciation of the ma is accepted in the conjuncts sma or dma (for example, padma &ndash; pad - ma), but in Bengali sma is pronounced like sya and dma is pronounced like dda, that is, ma is not pronounced separately. Sanskrit should be pronounced according to its own particular intonation and Bengali should also be pronounced according to its own style. Hindi and English also should follow their respective styles. The standard colloquial form of Bengali is Calcutta Bengali, hence it is only reasonable that educated Bengalees speak Calcutta Bengali. Maethilii, Avadhii,  Bhojpuri, etc. have their own intonations and those languages should be pronounced according to their respective intonations. For example, in Maethilii the rule is that if i follows a consonant in a word then the i is pronounced before the consonant, not after the consonant. For example, one writes pa&#x301;nii but pronounces it pa&#x301;in. Ma&#x301;t&#x301;i is pronounced mait&#x301;; bha&#x301;gi is pronounced bha&#x301;ig; pisii is pronounced pius; dar&#x301;ibha&#x301;un&#x32D;ga&#x301; is pronounced da&#x301;ir&#x301;bha&#x301;un&#x32D;ga&#x301;, and so on. If a triangle is created between three points located in London, Cambridge and Oxford then the spoken language of the area lying inside the triangle is standard spoken English and should be followed. Cockney and American English pronunciation are not correct pronunciations of the English language.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->I have said many times in the past and will repeat again that there is a need for an easy, well-understood spoken language with a high quality of intonation to be accepted as the standard spoken and written language for each and every language. In this respect, it appears that the Bengali of Calcutta should be considered to be standard Bengali. In the same way, the spoken language of Moghulpura&#x301; (near Lahore in Pakistan) for Panjabi, Campa&#x301;nagar for Angika (a little to the west of Bhagalpur &ndash; during the time of Karn&#x301;a this Campakanagarii was the capital of Angadesh), Gumla&#x301; for Na&#x301;gpurii, Cuttack for Oriya, Shivasagar for Assamese, Rajgir for Magahii (Rajgir or Rajgiri or Girivraja was the old capital of Magadha &ndash; it is situated in the heart of Magadha), Madhuvanii for Maethilii, Dumraon for  Bhojpuri (this is situated in the ancient district of Bhojpur), Rewa for Ba&#x301;ghelii, Delhi&#146;s Chandnichowk for Urdu (Lucknow&#146;s language is not Urdu but Avadhii), and Raipur for Chattrishgar&#x301;ii should be considered to be their respective language&#146;s accepted standard language. These languages not only take less time to speak, they also save space when they are written. It is pleasant to hear these free and unencumbered languages being spoken. The sixth condition for acceptance as a language is precisely this style of intonation, therefore attention must be paid to it.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="11..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The subject of today&#146;s discourse is psycho-acoustic and inferential acoustic notes.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Just as psycho-acoustic notes differ from person to person, a similar difference can be observed from collective to collective. These differences are of two kinds: due to sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ra and due to inclination. Sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ra changes from person to person and there are certain types of sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras which encapsulate the differences between one collective and another. Sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ra emanates from action. It does not differ with regards to time, place or person. However, this is not the case with differences due to inclination. Inclination depends on two factors: nervous structure and the influence of personal and collective environment. Here the meaning of collective may refer to ten people as well as to one race or another.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->There were originally four races on earth: Caucasian, Mongolian, Austric and Negroid. Many people, of course, do not wish to include the Semitic race among them. Like them, the Semitic people are also a separate race, the people of the Middle East. In some people&#146;s opinion they are a mixture of the Caucasian and Negroid races.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->There are three branches of the Caucasian race &ndash; Nordic, Alpine and Mediterranean. The meaning of the word &ldquo;Nordic&rdquo; is &ldquo;northern&rdquo;; it comes from the Latin word nord. The Alpine people lived neither so far north nor so far south, that is, they were the residents of central Europe, the tablelands of the Alps.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The Nordic people have high noses, blond hair, ruddy complexion and are tall in stature. The Alpine people are relatively short in stature. They are not so ruddy in complexion, have bluish hair and blue eyes. The Mediterranean people are fair-complexioned with black hair, black eyes and are somewhat shorter than the Alpine people. The collective name for these three branches is &ldquo;Aryan&rdquo;. The English word &ldquo;Aryan&rdquo; comes from German and originally from the Vedic word a&#x301;rya. As far as it can be determined, the word a&#x301;rya comes from the Vedic verbal root r which means &ldquo;to cultivate&rdquo; or &ldquo;to plough&rdquo;, so the meaning of the word a&#x301;rya becomes &ldquo;that person or community whose culture thrives through cultivation&rdquo;. The original homeland of the Aryans was Europe and the areas lying near the Caucasian mountains in central Russia. In northwest India and in Kashmir there is a good number of people of Aryan lineage, however their numbers in the rest of India is quite insignificant. The few who are there are mostly of mixed blood. Trying to search and pick them out would be quite difficult.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->As a result of Caucasian-centric aristocracy of colour an erroneous conception has taken up residence in the mind which, if clearly pointed out, might make many people uneasy. In other words, in order to avoid this uneasiness short-statured people will have to be accepted as Aryan, dark-complexioned people will have to be accepted as having come from Aryan stock, stoop-nosed people will have to be accepted as Aryan &ndash; what kind of thing is this? I will hearken back to my original remarks and maintain that apart from Kashmir and the northwest areas, the people in the other parts of India are not of Aryan stock. The Caucasians came to India from far away. They belong to the Mediterranean branch, not the Alpine or Nordic. Many people consider them to be the original inhabitants of Kashmir but that is incorrect. The original inhabitants of Kashmir belong to the Kash or Khas clans. They were people with slightly earthen complexion, short stature and snub noses.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->The word kashmir comes from the word kash or khas. In old Sanskrit the word meru was used to mean &ldquo;country&rdquo;. For example, ajeya meru &rarr; ajamiira. The original word is kashmeru. Kashmir means &ldquo;the land or meru of the Kash people&rdquo;. Many people write Ka&#x301;shmiir instead of Kashmiir. This is incorrect. The word ka&#x301;shmiir is derived by adding the suffix s&#x301;n&#x301;a to the word kashmiir and it means &ldquo;inhabitants of Kashmiir&rdquo; or &ldquo;concerning Kashmiir&rdquo;. Saffron is produced in Kashmiir thus saffron is also called ka&#x301;shmiir. The Hindi word keshriya&#x301; comes from the word ka&#x301;shmiir and it means &ldquo;ochre colour&rdquo;. We can call the Brahmans of Kashmir, Ka&#x301;shmiir Brahmans, not Ka&#x301;shmiirii Brahmans. Ka&#x301;shmiirii means &ldquo;women from Kashmiir&rdquo;. In the Ra&#x301;jataraunginii of Kalhan there is this description of the border of Kashmiir:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..8"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Sa&#x301;rada&#x301;mat&#x301;ha ma&#x301;ra&#x301;bhya kum&#x301;kuma&#x301;drtat&#x301;am&#x301;taka;<br>Ta&#x301;vat kashmiira deshasya&#x301;d pain&#x32D;ca&#x301;shat yojana&#x301;tmakah.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->That is, Kashmiir is the land which measures fifty yojana from Sa&#x301;rada&#x301;mat&#x301;h to the Kumkum mountains. India has a rich literature especially in Sanskrit, but there is very little historical literature. Due to philosophical confusion, there was a certain apathy towards history among the people of India. Because of this apathy the inhabitants of India were averse to composing history. It has to be considered by the scholars to what extent, apart from the Ra&#x301;jataraunginii, can the Ra&#x301;jama&#x301;la&#x301; of Tripura and the Assamese Burainji be classified as history. The greater portion of what we consider to be the history of the Indian middle ages had to be collected from the diaries of foreign travellers. In order to write even a single page of history we had to look up Fa&#x301;-Hiyen, Megha&#x301;sthinis, Ium&#x301;, Chuya&#x301;m&#x301;, or Ivanavatuta&#x301;. During the Pathan and Mughal eras there was some history written in the collections of the sovereigns but it is difficult to say just how far they are authoritative. However, we can say that even if not all was lost, something certainly was.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->The Negro race has three branches: western, northern and southern. There are differences in their facial appearance and hair. The hair is similar, but there are differences in the curls. The Mongolian race has five branches: Nippon (Japan), the original Chinese, Indo-Tibetan, Malaysian and Indo-Burmese. The script of the Chinese and Japanese branches is pictorial script. Each respective sound is represented by a particular picture. For example, instead of writing &ldquo;tree&rdquo; as we do, a mark is made to signify &ldquo;tree&rdquo;. Two of these marks mean &ldquo;park&rdquo;. A forest has many trees so three marks are used to mean &ldquo;forest&rdquo;. The framework of the Japanese alphabet is also fundamentally Chinese, that is, pictorial. Since the sun first rises over Japan the name of the country is Nippon. The first syllable is ni and the second syllable is ppon and together they make nippon. Some people pronounce nippon nihon. In this case they read the second picture hon instead of pon. In Chinese ni is pronounced ji and pon is pronounced pa&#x301;n, thus the pronunciation of nippon in Chinese became jipa&#x301;n. The distorted pronunciation of jipa&#x301;n in English gave rise to &ldquo;Japan&rdquo;. The people of the Nippon branch are large in size with flat noses and high jawbones. The Chinese branch is somewhat yellow in complexion and rather short in stature.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->The Caucasian alphabet is read from left to right. English, Latin, Greek, and so on, are all read from left to right. The Semitic alphabet is read from right to left. The Arabic and Israeli alphabets are included in this group. The Negroid people do not have their own script. They use Roman script. The people we call Dravidian in India are a mixture of Austric and Negroid. The word tamil comes from the word dra&#x301;vir&#x301;a [dravid]. Their script is Indo-Aryan.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->The people of the Indo-Tibetan branch are somewhat earthen-coloured and medium in stature. Their script is also Indo-Aryan. In this group fall the Tibetans, Laddakhis, Bhutanese, Sherpas, Lepchas, Gurum&#146;s, Newars, Tha&#x301;rus, etc. The Gorkhas do not belong to this branch. The Gorkhas are a mixture of Aryans and Tibetans. Their language, Gorkhali, is not an Indo-Tibetan language; it is a Sanskrit-derived language. Nowadays many people call the Gorkhali language &ldquo;Nepali&rdquo;. Actually &ldquo;Nepali&rdquo; does not refer to any specific language, but rather to all the languages of Nepal. These languages are Gorkhali, Newari, Ra&#x301;i, Tha&#x301;ru, Gurum&#x301;, Sherpa, Bhutanese, Lepcha, Magar, Limbu, Limpa&#x301;,  Bhojpuri (western Madeshii), Angika (Mora&#x301;m&#x301;), Maethilii (central Madeshii), Bengali (Jha&#x301;npa&#x301; District), and so on. &ldquo;Nepali&rdquo; does not refer to any specific language, any more than the word &ldquo;Indian&rdquo; does.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->The Gorkhas have adopted an Indo-Aryan script. Indo-Aryan scripts begin with a and end with ks&#x301;a. The Indo-Aryan languages of Nepal are included in the same group as Bengali and approximately twelve hundred years ago all of these languages were one and the same. The Carya&#x301;pada or Carya&#x301;caryavinishcaya was written in this language. It should be remembered here that the Carya&#x301;caryavinishcaya was discovered in Nepal and it was written in the Bengali script of that time (Shriihars&#x301;a script). The language of the Carya&#x301;caryavinishcaya can just as well be called old Angika or old Maethilii as old Bengali. Their script was also the old Bengali script, or Shriihars&#x301;a. It should also be remembered here that during the time of the Newari kings, Maethilii, written in Shriihars&#x301;a script, was the court language of Nepal. Gorkhali gained acceptance as the court language of Nepal with the reign of the Gorkha kings (Prthviina&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a Sha&#x301;h), and it is this Gorkhali that is mistakenly called Nepali. Of course this is a partial error, not a complete error, because, like Nepal&#146;s other languages, Gorkhali is also a Nepali language. Gorkhali&#146;s old script is also the Shriihars&#x301;a script. Later on Na&#x301;grii letters were introduced into Gorkhali. Old letters and records are all written in Bengali script (Shriihars&#x301;a). Thus the discovery of the old Bengali manuscript, the Carya&#x301;pada, in Nepal is not at all surprising because Nepal is a land of Bengali script. When Lolitapat&#x301;t&#x301;an (Lolitapa&#x301;t&#x301;an), Bhat&#x301;t&#x301;agra&#x301;m (Bha&#x301;t&#x301;ga&#x301;on), and so on, were the capital of the then Nepal, they used to use exclusively Shriihars&#x301;a script there.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->The fourth branch is the Malay branch. Included within this branch are the Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia. Chinese, Kachin, Shan, Burmese and Arakan (Mag) fall within the Indo-Burmese branch. None of these languages use pictorial script. They use Indo-Aryan scripts, that is, they are written from left to right.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Next comes the Austric branch. At one time there was one vast expanse of land which stretched from old Gondwanaland to Australia. The original inhabitants of this vast region were the ancient Austrics. They are black but not jet black. They are shorter in stature than the Negroes and their hair is not so curly. India&#146;s Kols, Bhiils, Mun&#x301;d&#x301;as, Har&#146;s (Santhals), and Biirhor&#x301;as, and the aborigines and Maoris of Australia and New Zealand all belong to the Austric branch, however the native inhabitants of the Andaman Islands do not. They are a mixture of Austric and Mongolian. The inhabitants of the Bengal-Burma border, the Jarvadiis, are also more or less of the same type.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->The Austric branch did not have its own script. They became familiar with Roman script when the Christian missionaries came in contact with them while proselytizing. India&#146;s Kols, Bhiils, Mun&#x301;d&#x301;as, Santhals, Biirhor&#x301;as, and so on, also belong to the Austric branch; they do not have their own script. The &ldquo;Ol&rdquo; script that some Santhals like to use was invented by Pandit Raghunath Murmu, a man of modern times.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->The script of the Dravidian group is Indo-Aryan, however here and there they have an extra letter or two, or one or two less. For example, Tamil has fewer letters while Telegu has more. While it is true that the lack of those few letters in modern Tamil makes it difficult to write Sanskrit properly, it is even more true that the special kind of Tamil script that the Tamil pandits use for writing Sanskrit works perfectly fine. This script goes by the name of Granthalipi or Grantha&#x301;ks&#x301;aram [book script]. The author&#146;s professor in the Vedas, Pandit P. K. Ayar, was able to write quite proper Sanskrit in this script.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.11.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#11.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> This script has neither disappeared nor become completely obsolete nowadays. In modern Tamil the numbers one and two are written alongside a few letters to indicate a certain kind of pronunciation. Others want to use some Singhalese letters for this purpose but there is no necessity of this. Tamil has its own closely related script. By using this book script Tamil will gain added respect.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->The Singhalese are a mixture of Aryan and Dravidian stock. They are fair-complexioned and short in stature. Their language has a great quantity of Sanskrit words. It is also a mixture of Aryan and Dravidian and most likely originated from a blending of Tamil and Bengali in olden times, however more research into this matter is needed. The Ora&#x301;on sub-caste in the Chottanagpur area is also part of the Dravidian group, not the Austric group. Their language, which is called Kuruk, is a Dravidian language. However Kuruk does not have its own script. The Ora&#x301;ons take their surnames from the names of different birds and animals, for example, Kacchap [tortoise], T&#x301;oppo, Miinz. Miinz means &ldquo;fish&rdquo; in Kuruk. In Tamil it is miinam. Many people think that miina is a Sanskrit word but actually it is not. It is a Dravidian word which has been absorbed into Sanskrit.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->In Bengal there is a mixture of Austric, Mongolian and Negroid stock. The further west and southwest you go, the greater the Dravidian (Austric-Negro) influence, and the further northeast you go, the greater the Mongolian influence. There is a great Mongolian influence seen in the Bengali Ca&#x301;kma&#146;s. The Ca&#x301;kma&#146;s live in the mountains of Chittagong, certain parts of Tripura and in the Demagiri region of the Lusa&#x301;i Hills (its modern name is Mizoram). The Mongolian influence is also pronounced in the far north of Bengal among the Bhutanese, Mech, Bor&#x301;o and Poliya communities.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->The analysis I have given of these races and their branches and sub-branches is based on their individual and collective characteristics which also includes psycho-acoustic notes. The same Indo-Aryan script is pronounced differently in the throats of different races. The same alphabet is of one type in northern India, another in western India and yet another in southern India, and its pronunciation in Bengal, Tibet, Burma and Thailand reflects the local differences. This is due to racial influence. Of course, climate can also exert a certain influence. The same Semitic alphabet is pronounced differently in Arabia, Persia, Pakistan and Israel &ndash; I am saying this from personal experience. The same Roman script is pronounced differently in Britain and in France. Britain and France are neighbouring states but there is a night and day difference in their pronunciation. In Italy, France, Spain and Portugal, who all use the same Roman script, the disparity is less acute. These psycho-acoustic notes can be caused by inclination as well as by sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ra. It is said: Bhinna-rucirhi loka&#x301;h [people have different likings]. Inclinations are based on two objective factors: the composition of the nerves and climatic conditions. The composition of the nerves is, in turn, based on racial constituents.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->Each race has its own special characteristics. The people of one race do not anger easily while those of another keep their anger bottled up. The people of one race are overpowered by happiness while those of another express their happiness effusively. The people of one race keep their sorrow inside while those of another break into tears of sorrow. Some cannot keep their mouth closed while others do not like to open their mouths at all. It must be kept in mind here that these matters are not all due to racial influence; many of them depend on climatic conditions. In countries with a wetter climate people feel more need to eat chillies, otherwise there is a likelihood of rheumatic attacks. Even though the inhabitants of those places know that it is not good to eat too many chillies, they continue to eat them in large quantities.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->It is worth mentioning here that chillies are not indigenous to India or Bengal. Before chillies were available in our country, long peppers (pippali in Sanskrit) and black peppers (kat&#x301;ubiijam) were used. When the Portuguese brought chilli [laun&#x32D;ka&#x301;] to this country people had a problem naming it. In order to differentiate between chilli and black pepper they gave it the name ga&#x301;chmaric and called the other golmaric (before the arrival of chillies black pepper was simply called maric [pepper]). Black pepper is a creeper while chilli is an upright plant; accordingly the name ga&#x301;cmaric was given [ga&#x301;ch means &ldquo;plant&rdquo; or &ldquo;tree&rdquo;]. In old Bengali laun&#x32D;ka&#x301; used to refer to any expanse of land enclosed by water, that is, it did not refer to only Sri Lanka or Ceylon. The word vilayet, prevalent in Arabic and Farsi, also means &ldquo;an enclosed island land&rdquo; or &ldquo;foreign land&rdquo;. Some people think that perhaps Vila&#x301;yet or Vilet means &ldquo;Britain&rdquo; but this conception is incorrect. In Urdu and Farsi, Britain is called &ldquo;Vartta&#x301;niya&#x301;&rdquo;. The British government is called &ldquo;Hukumate Vartta&#x301;niya&#x301;&rdquo;. Anyhow, this laun&#x32D;ka&#x301;maric or chili-pepper came from a foreign land, that is, it came from Laun&#x32D;ka&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->There is a verse in the Carya&#x301;pada:<!-- /block --></p>

Wisdom is nearby; there is no need to go to a foreign land for it.&rdquo; Here also the word laun&#x32D;ka&#x301; has been used to mean &ldquo;foreign land&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->With the passage of time, the use of the word ga&#x301;chmaric declined and the new name for it became laun&#x32D;kamaric. Nowadays the word maric has disappeared and only the word laun&#x32D;ka&#x301;, meaning &ldquo;foreign land&rdquo;, remains. In Rarhi Bengali chilli was named sa&#x301;garapa&#x301;riya&#x301; for a similar reason. From this comes the modern Rarhi sonpare.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->Tamarind should be eaten in countries with wet or damp climates, otherwise one feels a lack of vigour and tamarind also grows more in these kinds of countries. Mangoes were not used in Persia which in modern times is called Iran. Ancient Persia did not have a word for mango. In later times it was given the name ambaj. Tamarind also was not found there. Later on it was given the name ta&#x301;mar. There is a story about some people from Persia (Iran) who came once to India. When they saw the tamarind they thought that perhaps this was the famous Indian mango. They gave it the name ta&#x301;mar-i-ind. After undergoing a slight distortion it became &ldquo;tamarind&rdquo; in English. The Bengali word for tamarind, tentul, comes from the Sanskrit word tinttir&#x301;ii; in Oriya it is tenntar&#x301;i or tentur&#x301;. The Maethilii word tetar also comes from the word tinttar&#x301;ii. The word a&#x301;mlii in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan (Marwari) comes from the Sanskrit word a&#x301;mlika. In old Bengali also the word a&#x301;mlii or a&#x301;mla&#x301; was used to mean &ldquo;tamarind&rdquo; &ndash; nowadays this usage has practically disappeared. The author had seen the word being used in the Pabna District of Bengal about fifty years ago. The word a&#x301;mlii underwent alteration and became the word imlii in modern Hindi. There is an example in the old Caryapada which shows that tamarind used to be called tentuli in old Bengali:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..28"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->Duli duhi pit&#x301;ha&#x301; dharan&#x301;a na ja&#x301;i<br>Rukher tentuli kumbhiire kha&#x301;i<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->Just as tamarind should be eaten in hot, wet climates as I mentioned earlier, in hot, dry climates people say that if they do not eat poppy-seed or black gram in their country they will be susceptible to nosebleeds so they have to eat it. Thus the climate or environment exerts a particular influence over inclination.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->Now, the mental feeling, neither crude nor subtle, which arises in the mind upon seeing some object is a particular type of mental vibration. For example, if one sees the colour white or red then the vibration created by that mental impression creates a sound in the nervous system in accordance with the wavelength of that vibration. In the case of red it is t&#x301;akt&#x301;ak and in the case of white it is dhapdhap. Thereafter we create a word according to that sound vibration. The words khankhan, t&#x301;hant&#x301;han, jhanjhan, and so on, were made in this way. First a vibration arises in the nerves when an object is seen, then a mental sound is created and finally a word is made based on that sound. In this way the original verbal roots of language are created based on psychic sounds, and different words have been created, and are being created, from these verbal roots. For example: dhapdhap &rarr; dhavhdav &rarr; dhav. By adding la (verbal root la&#x301;, suffix d&#x301;a) to dhava we get dhavala which means &ldquo;white&rdquo;. When we see the colour red [la&#x301;l] which gives rise to the sound vibration t&#x301;akt&#x301;ak in the nerves then we say that the thing is t&#x301;akt&#x301;ake la&#x301;l. Similarly we say dhavdhave sa&#x301;da&#x301; [white]. The word t&#x301;akt&#x301;ake becomes t&#x301;ukt&#x301;uke out of affection. Khoka&#x301; becomes khokan for the same reason.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->This hidden truth behind the creation of words has been hitherto neglected by science and philosophy, but it should not be so because all sounds in this universe have their origin in these psycho-acoustic notes. These specific sounds are chiefly divided into seven partial sounds which we call the seven note scale. The composition of various sounds, the creation of all languages and dialects, is produced from permutations and combinations of this seven note scale. Shiva took the help of these fundamental sounds to create the six ragas and thirty-six raginis of Indian classical music. It is a matter of regret that few of those who are engaged in the serious study of music maintain any special interest or enthusiasm for this subject. Thus the science of psycho-acoustic notes, which is behind the creation of sound, has been neglected.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->This science behind the creation of words which was neglected for so long should not be allowed to remain undiscovered. This is not only the case here &ndash; the same thing has been happening with all of the world&#146;s languages. Wherever there are people, words are created based on these psycho-acoustic notes. All musical knowledge depends on it, the entire science of music. Not only the different metres, flats and sharps, bass, baritone and soprano &ndash; all fundamental principles of sound depend on the principles of this science. The use of the pronoun &ldquo;you&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;thou&rdquo; is based on it; the use of vous in French instead of tu is based on it.<!-- /block --></p>

Gradually mujhko [to me], tujhko [to you] are being displaced by mereko and tereko. The old Bengali words mui [I] and tui [you], or mu and tu, have been replaced by a&#x301;mi and tumi. Nowadays you will hardly hear anyone say mui ja&#x301;vuni in the village areas of Rarh; the people say a&#x301;mi ja&#x301;vuni. An example of the use of mui can be seen in the poetry of Krishnadas Kaviraj:<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="11..38"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=38 type=paragraph -->The women of ancient Bengal used to use mishi [a dentifrice made of roasted tobacco, copperas, and other ingredients] to make their teeth sparkling white. Mishi is black so when we see something very black we say that it is as black as mishi &ndash; mishka&#x301;lo. You know that for a while part of the pomegranate seed is glossy black, so if we want to indicate that something is very black we compare it to pomegranate [kuc] and say kuckuce ka&#x301;lo. In order to refer to something soft we make an analogy to cotton and say that it is as soft as cotton [tulo] &ndash; tultule naram. If something is somewhat black but not completely black then we refer to it as ka&#x301;lce [blackish]. Similarly, la&#x301;lce is used for something somewhat reddish and niilce for &ldquo;bluish&rdquo;. Ce means &ldquo;somewhat&rdquo;. It is a native Bengali suffix. English has its own similar suffixes such as &ldquo;like&rdquo; and &ldquo;ish&rdquo;. &ldquo;Like&rdquo; is added in a good sense, for example &ldquo;childlike&rdquo; while the suffix &ldquo;ish&rdquo; is added in a derogatory sense. For example: Tinka&#x301;l giye ekka&#x301;le t&#x301;hekla, ekhano khoka&#x301;mi gela na [He&#146;s gone through childhood, youth and adulthood but still hasn&#146;t got the childishness out]. Here &ldquo;childishness&rdquo; is used to mean khoka&#x301;mi. Similarly, the word &ldquo;rural&rdquo; is used to mean gra&#x301;miin&#x301; or gra&#x301;mya while the word &ldquo;rustic&rdquo; [pejorative sense] is used to mean genyo bhu&#x301;t. If something is like water when eaten then sa&#x301; is used to mean &ldquo;like&rdquo;. For example, &ldquo;like water&rdquo; &ndash; jalsa&#x301; [watery]. Similarly pa&#x301;niisa&#x301; or pa&#x301;nse is used for &ldquo;like pa&#x301;nii&rdquo; [also &ldquo;water&rdquo;]. The suffix sa&#x301; is also used in this way in Hindi, for example, ka&#x301;la&#x301;sa&#x301; [blackish], gora&#x301;sa&#x301; [whitish], etc. However the suffix ce is not used in chaste Hindi. Water used to be called pa&#x301;nii in old Bengali. It is not true that the word pa&#x301;nii was not used because of some difference in religion. Water is still called pa&#x301;nii in the Sylhet dialect. There, if one wants to say ek ha&#x301;nt&#x301;u jale [in knee-deep water] one says ha&#x301;nt&#x301;upa&#x301;nit.

What to speak of Bengali, none of the world&#146;s languages have put them properly to work. Yet they are the hidden wealth of the human mind.

These are native English words; they have not been created under Norman or Anglo-Saxon influence, for example: &ldquo;nice&rdquo;, &ldquo;fine&rdquo;, and so on. The word &ldquo;fine&rdquo; is not used where the word &ldquo;nice&rdquo; is used. Something which is soft to the touch, or hot or cold, is &ldquo;fine&rdquo;, for example, &ldquo;fine cloth&rdquo;. However in the case of a good taste &ldquo;nice&rdquo; is used, for example, &ldquo;nice biscuits&rdquo;. For beautiful poetry and so forth the word &ldquo;beautiful&rdquo; is used. In the case of beautiful realizations the word mis&#x301;t&#x301;i [sweet] is used in Bengali, for example, mis&#x301;t&#x301;i kavita&#x301; [beautiful poetry]. These are all inferential acoustic notes. In olden times one would determine how handsome a man was by seeing the length of his hand.

In comparison with other modern Indian languages in use today, Maethilii has the greatest number of these kinds of words. For this reason Maethilii conversation is quite rich.<!-- /block --></p>

<div class=book_chapter_info_top></div>

<a name="12..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->I will talk a little today about the Farsi words currently in use in Bengali. The distortion or alteration of vowel sounds is very important in any language. The first thing to say about Farsi is that there is some confusion regarding u and o in Farsi and languages related to Farsi. Kut&#x301;hi and kot&#x301;hi, duka&#x301;n and doka&#x301;n &ndash; the interchangeability of u and o is accepted as an unwritten rule in many languages. In Hindustani one says duka&#x301;n but in  Bhojpuri, Maethilii, Magahii and Angika one says doka&#x301;n. In Bengali one also says doka&#x301;n. In Farsi there is a difference between words of masculine and feminine gender but this does not affect the verbs as it does in Urdu and Hindi. Most of the languages descended from Pra&#x301;krta, with the exception of Ma&#x301;gadhii, have two genders, masculine and feminine, much the same as in French. In the languages descended from Shaorasenii Pra&#x301;krta (Bundelii, Ba&#x301;ghelii, Avadhii, Vraja, Hariya&#x301;navii) the difference in gender can be seen in the genitive case, just as in French. However the difference is that the French verb has three different forms &ndash; masculine, feminine and plural while in Hindustani there are four forms &ndash; masculine singular, masculine plural, feminine singular and feminine plural. For example: Lar&#x301;ka&#x301; ja&#x301; raha&#x301; hae; lar&#x301;ke ja&#x301; rahe haen; lar&#x301;kii ja&#x301; rahii hae; and lar&#x301;kiya&#x301;n ja&#x301; rahii haen. In Shaorasenii Pra&#x301;krta ka is added to the end of a word to indicate masculine gender and kii to indicate feminine gender, while in the masculine plural or to show respect ke is placed before the word. In Ma&#x301;gadhii Pra&#x301;krta, as in Bengali, Oriya, Assamese, Maethilii,  Bhojpuri, Angika, Magahii, Chattrishgar&#x301;ii, Na&#x301;gpurii, etc., there is no difference between masculine, feminine and neuter genders in the genitive case. For example: Ra&#x301;mer bha&#x301;i [Ram&#146;s brother], Ra&#x301;mer bon [Ram&#146;s sister], Siita&#x301;r bha&#x301;i [Siita&#146;s brother], Siita&#x301;r bon [Siita&#146;s sister].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->In Farsi both u and o can be used with the same meaning, but in the Shaorasenii Pra&#x301;krta descendants u is used. Take, for example, duka&#x301;n &ndash; here doka&#x301;n cannot be used. And in the languages that come from Ma&#x301;gadhii Pra&#x301;krta, the o pronunciation is seen, that is, the pronunciation will be doka&#x301;n, not duka&#x301;n. In Hindustani the word duka&#x301;n is used in both masculine and feminine genders, but if the word is used in feminine gender then it is spelled duka&#x301;n (with u) and if it is used in masculine gender it is spelled du&#x301;ka&#x301;n (with u&#x301;). In other words, merii duka&#x301;n [my shop] but mera&#x301; du&#x301;ka&#x301;n. In Hindustani the possessive case changes in this way according to gender. Hindi and Urdu follow Farsi but in Farsi there is no change in gender in the possessive case. Gender is connected with the verb in Hindi and Urdu but not in Farsi, so Farsi is quite easy to learn.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->People certainly do not understand everything they see or hear. One person understands while another person does not. One who has sufficient thinking capacity can understand and one who understands is samajhda&#x301;r. The word samajh is of Farsi origin. The Sanskrit-derived word for it is bojha which comes from the Sanskrit bodha. In Pra&#x301;krta the light Sanskrit dha becomes ha and the hard dha becomes jha. For example, dadhi becomes dahi [yoghurt] while sandhya&#x301; becomes sanjha &rarr; sa&#x301;njh [evening] and bandhya&#x301; &rarr; banjha&#x301; &rarr; ba&#x301;njha&#x301; [barren]. Here the dha becomes jha because it is a hard dha. Similarly bodha becomes bojha. The word bojha is used for the English &ldquo;to understand&rdquo; in the languages derived from Ma&#x301;gadhii Pra&#x301;krta. For example, a&#x301;mi bujhlum, tumi bujhle, hamma&#x301; bujhae nyay pa&#x301;raichiye. But in the languages derived from Shaorasenii Pra&#x301;krta, the Farsi word samajh is used instead of the Sanskrit-derived word bojha&#x301;. In these languages the word bojha&#x301; means &ldquo;to be extinguished&rdquo;, for the example, &ldquo;the light went out&rdquo;. In Hindi one says vattii bujh gayii. I have just said that in the Ma&#x301;gadhii Pra&#x301;krta-derived languages the word bojha&#x301; means &ldquo;to understand&rdquo;, thus these languages do not use the root verb bojh to mean &ldquo;to be extinguished&rdquo;. In these languages &ldquo;the light went out&rdquo; would be translated by vattii but gelai or vattii but gaila.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="12..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->I was talking about the use of Farsi words in Bengali. There are a great number of Farsi words in Bengali. It should be noted here that these Farsi words have either entered into Bengali in altered form, been altered after entering the language, or else there has been an attempt to Sanskritize them while in other cases they have retained their proper form. For example, the Farsi word ada&#x301;lat has become a&#x301;da&#x301;lat in Bengali; the Farsi mukadma&#x301; has become mokaddama&#x301;; pasiind has become pachanda; hadd has become haddo; khuda&#x301; became khoda&#x301; (of course in this case I have already discussed the mutual interchange between u and o); kacharii became ka&#x301;cha&#x301;ri; bandowasta became bandovasta; kaka&#x301; became ka&#x301;ka&#x301;.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.12.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#12.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> There are some nouns in Bengali which use the Farsi suffixes da&#x301;r, gar, and ka&#x301;r. For example, one who understands is samajhda&#x301;r; one who is in debt is dena&#x301;da&#x301;r; the owner of a shop is doka&#x301;nda&#x301;r. Similarly, pa&#x301;ona&#x301;da&#x301;r [creditor], jamida&#x301;r [landlord], dilda&#x301;r [open-hearted], and so on. Many people improperly say delda&#x301;r instead of dilda&#x301;r. Of course the Farsi word dil is used in Bengali but many people distort the pronunciation and say del although the actual pronunciation of the word is somewhere between dil and del &ndash; do del ba&#x301;nda&#x301; kalma&#x301; cor / na&#x301; pa&#x301;y vehast na&#x301; pa&#x301;y gor. The correct Bengali pronunciation of what we call jamida&#x301;r in Bengali is either jaminda&#x301;r or jamiinda&#x301;r. The above mentioned words are all Farsi &ndash; they are neither Bengali, nor Sanskrit, nor even Indian, but what does that actually matter? These words belong to the language of human beings. We are using them and will continue to do so. A language is enriched by plucking words from other languages and incorporating them, thereby increasing its expressive power. No manner of touchability or untouchability can be allowed in this respect, otherwise a language will run into difficulties. One cannot simply remain inside one&#146;s house collecting brinjals from the courtyard garden with a rake and deny the existence of the great vanaspati tree while refusing to set foot outside. If we do not enrich our own mother tongues or other languages by incorporating words from outside then our condition will become like that of a person who shuts their doors and windows in the middle of the day and then cries out for fear of the dark. Open your doors and windows. Let the outside light and air in and make yourself healthy. Who can deny the fact that the noble attitude of gathering words from other languages has contributed to the enrichment of Bengali? Thus none of these words have been dropped from Bengali, right from ja&#x301;dugar to dilda&#x301;r, hukamda&#x301;r and mansavda&#x301;r.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;One who has ja&#x301;n, or life,&rdquo; is ja&#x301;nda&#x301;r. &ldquo;One who has ja&#x301;n&rdquo; is also called ja&#x301;nvar if the Farsi suffix var is added to the root word ja&#x301;n. However when doing so one should keep in mind the difference in usage between the suffixes da&#x301;r and var. All living creatures who have ja&#x301;n are ja&#x301;nda&#x301;r, but those who, despite having ja&#x301;n, do not have a great deal of intellect are ja&#x301;nvar (ja&#x301;nowa&#x301;r &ndash; animal), derived by adding the suffix var to the root word ja&#x301;n.

Later this hubble-bubble became a symbol of the aristocracy. At that time they used to use gold and silver hubble-bubbles. It was most likely the Empress Nurjahan who introduced the hubble-bubble. Smoking tobacco in a hookah, however, presupposes a certain inconvenience. One cannot carry a hookah around in one&#146;s pocket as one does with cigarettes, so an employee used to walk behind them carrying the hookah. Such a person was called a hukka&#x301;varda&#x301;r which is a Farsi word. When a European would feel the need for a smoke they would call out: E hukka&#x301;varda&#x301;r, t&#x301;um keya&#x301; kart&#x301;a hae, t&#x301;um hukka&#x301; le ao [Heh, hukka&#x301;varda&#x301;r, what are you doing, bring the hookah.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->The meaning of the word hukmda&#x301;r is &ldquo;one who is prepared to obey a hukum [order]&rdquo;. The English for hukmda&#x301;r is &ldquo;orderly&rdquo; which has become a&#x301;rda&#x301;lii in Bengali. The word hukumda&#x301;r in Bengali comes from the word hukmda&#x301;r. &ldquo;One who obeys the commands of God&rdquo; is called hukm-i-ra&#x301;m or hukmiira&#x301;m. You will still find a few Hukmiira&#x301;m Singhs in northwest India. We can pose the question here whether or not the word hukmda&#x301;r is actually Farsi, even though it appears to be at first glance. There are many Urdu and Farsi scholars who are not quite sure where the word comes from. Actually the word is English. It arrived in India by way of Europe initially, then Turkey and finally Persia. In this process it underwent changes. Actually it comes from the English &ldquo;Who come there?&rdquo; When an on-duty military person would see unknown persons approaching they would ask &ldquo;Who come there?&rdquo; In answer, the approaching person, if everything was above-board, would raise their hands and call out &ldquo;friend&rdquo; (dost in Hindustani). Anyhow the word hukmda&#x301;r comes from this &ldquo;Who come there?&rdquo; Here da&#x301;r is not an example of a suffix. We do not remember this fact but not remembering does not mean forgetting.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="12..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->The Farsi word saoda&#x301;gar [merchant], that is, &ldquo;one who understands trade&rdquo;, has the suffix gar added. Ja&#x301;dugar means &ldquo;one who knows or understands ja&#x301;du [magic]&rdquo;. It is worth mentioning that some people spell the word ja&#x301;dukar instead of ja&#x301;dugar. They see this as being formed by adding kr + al to the root word ja&#x301;du, but this is incorrect. Ja&#x301;du is a Farsi word. By adding the Farsi suffix gar we get ja&#x301;dugar which means &ldquo;one who knows or understands magic&rdquo;, so the spelling ja&#x301;dukar is incorrect from top to bottom. The Sanskrit synonym is va&#x301;jikara. Kara is a Sanskrit suffix. Farsi does not have a suffix kar. The word ka&#x301;r which is found in Farsi is not a suffix. Ka&#x301;r means &ldquo;work&rdquo; [ka&#x301;j] in Farsi (The word ka&#x301;m [work] which is currently used in Hindi comes from the Sanskrit karma; it is also used in rural Bengali). The word ka&#x301;j is also used in Maethilii &ndash; ehan ka&#x301;j ham na&#x301; sakab. Some people spell ka&#x301;j with ya instead of ja. This is downright wrong. Antahstha ya is only used at the beginning of a word. In the middle or at the end of a word its pronunciation becomes &ldquo;ia&rdquo;, thus if someone spells ka&#x301;j with ya instead of ja then it is read as ka&#x301;y instead of ka&#x301;j. Incidentally I should point out that many people spell iurop [Europe] as yurop. This is also wrong. If ya occurs at the beginning of a word then it is pronounced like ja [antahstha ya], thus if iurop is spelled yurop its pronunciation becomes &ldquo;Jurope&rdquo; &ndash; quite difficult, indeed.<!-- /block --></p>

It is almost as if there were a conspiracy to mistake God for a ghost. In my childhood I used to say a&#x301;m [mango] instead of a&#x301;nb.

<a name="12..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->There are also some Farsi words in Bengali formed with da&#x301;r.

There is a heaven and hell difference between the Bengali pronunciation of jamida&#x301;r and the Farsi pronunciation. If the consonant na occurs at the end of a word in Farsi then na is dropped and the preceding letter is nasalized, especially if na occurs in the first word of a compound word. Thus jamin can become jamiin. For this reason one can also say jamiinda&#x301;r for jaminda&#x301;r in Farsi. However in Bengali the word is mistakenly pronounced jamida&#x301;r. Hindusta&#x301;n, gulista&#x301;n, pa&#x301;kista&#x301;n, and so on, follow the same pattern. Sta&#x301;n is rendered in English as &ldquo;stan&rdquo;. Bear in mind that the concerning Sanskrit word for sta&#x301;n is stha&#x301;nam. The Farsi word sta&#x301;n comes from the Vedic word stha&#x301;nam, however this Vedic word has remained unaltered in Sanskrit. Stha&#x301;nam becomes t&#x301;ha&#x301;nam in Pra&#x301;krta, t&#x301;ha&#x301;nvii in Demi-Pra&#x301;krta and t&#x301;ha&#x301;ini in old Bengali. The word t&#x301;ha&#x301;ni in modern Bengali is used quite readily in colloquial speech and in some poetry. T&#x301;hinya&#x301; in Angika comes from this t&#x301;ha&#x301;ni and t&#x301;hiya&#x301; as well as thinya&#x301; were used in Rarhi Bengali in olden times.

Dast in Farsi means &ldquo;hand&rdquo;. One whose hand is very generous is dara&#x301;jdast. The hand&#146;s mark is dastakhat. That which is worn on the hand is dasta&#x301;na&#x301;. A hand&#146;s written evidence is dasta&#x301;bej. One who is leader of the government or the rulers is dastida&#x301;r. There are many people in Bengal who have the surname Dastida&#x301;r.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->Earlier it was mentioned that efforts have been made to turn some of those Farsi words currently used in Bengali into Sanskrit while others have become altered. For example, &ldquo;one who has hunsh, or consciousness&rdquo; is called honshiya&#x301;r in Farsi; it has become hunshiya&#x301;r in Bengali. Likewise, mihannat has undergone alteration and become mehanat in Bengali. All Farsi words which end in at are feminine in gender. This rule is also followed in Hindi and Urdu. For example, mehanat karnii hae. Even though the words ga&#x301;t, ma&#x301;t, bha&#x301;t and so on, end in a&#x301;t, they are masculine. For example, Siita ne bha&#x301;t kha&#x301;ya&#x301;. Bha&#x301;t is masculine, thus it becomes Siita ne bha&#x301;t kha&#x301;ya&#x301;. On the other hand: Ra&#x301;m ne rot&#x301;ii kha&#x301;yii. Rot&#x301;ii is feminine, thus Ra&#x301;m ne rot&#x301;ii kha&#x301;yii. The word bha&#x301;t [cooked rice] comes from the Pra&#x301;krta word bhatta. It is not a Sanskrit word. The Sanskrit for bha&#x301;t is odanam. The word rot&#x301;ii [bread], however, comes from the Sanskrit word rot&#x301;ika&#x301;. The Hindi word capa&#x301;tii [a flat, unleavened bread] comes from the Sanskrit word carpat&#x301;ika&#x301;. There is no Sanskrit-derived word in either Hindi or Bengali for the Sanskrit soma&#x301;lika&#x301;. The Hindi synonym for soma&#x301;lika&#x301; is puri [fried, unleavened bread]; if it is fried in strained ghee then it is called luci in Bengali. Even though the word luci comes from Farsi and remains in use in three languages, Panjabi, Kashmiri and Urdu, luci has become a native Bengali word. Thus luci, nuci; leci, neci, can be used equally &ndash; none of them can be labelled incorrect.<!-- /block --></p>

For example, am&#x301;gur [grape] (a&#x301;ungur in Bengali and dra&#x301;ks&#x301;a&#x301; in Sanskrit), beda&#x301;na&#x301; [pomegranate], kismis [raisin], pesta&#x301; [pistachio] and khova&#x301;nii [apricot] are all Farsi words. A&#x301;na&#x301;ras [pineapple] is an Iberian word. The Portuguese brought this fruit to India from the western Indian archipelago. The fruit&#146;s real pronunciation is a&#x301;na&#x301;nas but since it is a juicy [rasa&#x301;l] fruit it has been given the name a&#x301;na&#x301;ras in Bengali. There are two varieties of pineapple in Bengal, the variety brought from the western Indian archipelago and the variety brought from the eastern Indian archipelago. The eastern Indian archipelago pineapple, which we normally call the Singapore pineapple, is large in size and thornless, while the western Indian archipelago pineapple, which we normally call the Ba&#x301;ruipurii pineapple, is smaller in size, golden-coloured and has thorns. None of the pineapples which grow in Tripura and Assam are native to this country; they have been brought from the eastern Indian archipelago. The mango (a&#x301;m or a&#x301;nb) has been previously discussed. Generally the word a&#x301;m is used more frequently in Bengali although the word a&#x301;nb is more correct.<!-- /block --></p>

Guava is not native to this country. While it is true that guava is called perukam or biijapu&#x301;rakam in modern Laokika Sanskrit, both of these words are quite recent. The Bengali word piya&#x301;ra&#x301; or peya&#x301;ra&#x301; and the Marathii word peru (ripe guava is called pikle peru in Marathii) come from the Iberian word piya&#x301;ro. In the Sylhet and Mymensing areas it is called saphlii a&#x301;m or soprii a&#x301;m. It should be kept in mind that there are many words in Bengali which are formed by adding the word soprii meaning &ldquo;foreign&rdquo;. For example, the bananas imported from Martaban Province in Burma are called martama&#x301;n kala&#x301; in Calcutta, anupam kala&#x301; in north Bengal and soparii kala&#x301; in east Bengal. Guava is called a&#x301;njir in Rarh. The word a&#x301;njir is common in the markets of Siurii, Dumka, Deoghar, Dhanbad, Asansol, Bankura, Purulia and Tata. Guava is called t&#x301;a&#x301;mras in the western outlying areas of Rarh &ndash; Jhalda, Muri, Silli, and so on. In Angika it is called sa&#x301;phlii a&#x301;m and in Maethilii lat-a&#x301;m. In Patna, Magadha, Muzaffarpur and Bhojpur it is called a&#x301;mdhur and in chaste Hindi it is amru&#x301;d.<!-- /block --></p>

After a military encampment was established there during the British time they used to hold the customary drill and target practice so there was the constant sound dama&#x301;dam, dama&#x301;dam [boom boom].

There is no sense in shutting one&#146;s doors and windows in the middle of the day and then crying out that one cannot bear the darkness. The doors and windows will have to be flung open to let the outside light in. Words will have to be gathered from various languages in order to make the Bengali language more expressive.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="13..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The subject of today&#146;s discourse is syntax. Syntax refers to a language&#146;s grammatical and structural style. How a word, that is, noun, adjective, pronoun, indeclinable, is placed in the sentence in accordance with the rules of grammar is syntax. One interesting thing is the debate over where the word &ldquo;syntax&rdquo; comes from &ndash; from which language. There is no end to the differences of opinion among the various scholars. Some people say it is a Latin word, others say Greek, others say Ottoman Turkish and still others claim that it was produced by mixing Greek and Semitic.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Now the starting-point of syntax is the division into parts of speech (vibhakti). Within a sentence we get inflections, non-verb forms, word agreement, verb conjugations and so on. In all languages the sentence is divided into two parts, the subject and the predicate.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->According to the so-called rules of grammar, the first case is the nominative case, but is this conception correct?<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.13.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#13.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> People developed this conception when they began to think of grammar as infallible and that people would have to speak accordingly, but this is not correct. Grammar must be formulated according to the way people speak; that is, grammar is a systemized form of dialogue &ndash; the accepted structure for the rules and regulations of conversation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The derivation of vya&#x301;karan&#x301;a [grammar] is vi &ndash; a&#x301; &ndash; kr + anat&#x301;, that is, vya&#x301;karan&#x301;a is a process which is to be followed in order to express in a particular way. Thus grammar needs to maintain adjustment with human language. Grammar is not something that falls from the heavens and which should therefore be followed blindly or considered to be infallible. Mankind&#146;s oral language changes from age to age. The kind of syntax which people used to follow a thousand years ago in order to express their thoughts is no longer followed today. In other words, how can we call a grammar infallible which follows a thousand year-old language which is now dead. Moreover, it is through travel and communication that a language&#146;s speed, along with its powers of assimilation, increases and local differences decrease. But when the means of travel are undeveloped and communication is cut off then a language cannot change quickly. In the villages and markets of east Bengal the people still speak the same language they used to speak three hundred years ago. On the other hand, the language of West Bengal&#146;s Midnapore and Howrah districts has become like Calcutta&#146;s through good means of communication and travel. Three hundred years ago, however, the spoken language of these two districts was not at all similar to Calcutta&#146;s. Nowadays the spoken language of the Contai area of Midnapore District is still under greater rural influence. The means of travel in the Contai area is still not good. There is practically no railway in this subdivision. For this reason the spoken language of southern 24 Paraganas has not been able to free itself from rural influence and become modern. The old language is still passed on orally in the Barisal area of east Bengal due to the poor means of travel. It is for this very reason that there are differences in the spoken language of east Bengal, not only from district to district, but from subdivision to subdivision. It is very easy to understand who comes from where by listening to them speak, but this is not the case in West Bengal. A person from Jalpaiguri speaks the same kind of Bengali as a person from Midnapore. This has become possible through the quality of the means of travel. The system of travel in West Bengal is not only better than many other areas of India, but is also better than many developed countries outside India.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The mountain-folk who reside in the forests and remote mountains do not speak the exact same Bengali that the people from the plains of Godda Subdivision speak. Their Bengali is nearly a thousand years old because they have been living in inaccessible mountain areas. Since they have not maintained adjustment with the speed of the modern age, their language has undergone very little alteration in these one thousand years (ha&#x301;nu pa&#x301;nr&#x301;i kha&#x301;mu, ha&#x301;nu gharke ja&#x301;mu [I shall drink water, I shall go home]). However the conversation of residents of the plains in that area is similar to the spoken language of Birbhum. Conversely, the spoken language of the mountain-folk of the Sahebganj and Rajmahal regions is similar to that of Godda. The Malpaharis of the Deoghar, Jamtara, Dumka and Pakur areas remain closer to the people of the plains despite living in the forests and mountains; thus their spoken language shows some modern influences. The spoken language of the Malpaharis who live in the plains regions of eastern Rarh is similar to the spoken language of other local Bengalees. In the plains they are known as Jhalla-Mallas or Malla-Ks&#x301;atriyas or Ma&#x301;los.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->It&#146;s worth remembering that the southern part of Barendra Bhu&#x301;mi, that is, the Ma&#x301;ldah region, was once controlled by the Malla-Ks&#x301;atriya kings. Later it passed into the control of the Paon&#x301;d&#x301;ra Ks&#x301;atriya kings. Since then, the southern portion of Barendra Bhu&#x301;mi has been known as Paon&#x301;d&#x301;ra Vardhan District and the northern part as Ka&#x301;mta&#x301;pur District. Later on this Ka&#x301;mta&#x301;pur District was divided into two parts. The name of the area stretching from Purnia District&#146;s Kis&#x301;a&#x301;n&#x301;gain&#x32D;j to the Saun&#x32D;koca River in the east was the kingdom of Coochbihar. East of the Saun&#x32D;koca River was called the Vijanii Estate. Vijanii was incorporated into the newly formed state of Assam in 1912. The first king of Bhutan, Devaraj II, occupied Vijanii&#146;s Dewangiri area; he also invaded Coochbihar&#146;s Jayantii region. The Gorkha kings of Nepal controlled the district of Jha&#x301;npa&#x301; situated on the western bank of the Mecii River, west of the kingdom of Coochbihar&#146;s Na&#x301;ksha&#x301;lba&#x301;r&#x301;ii. This Jhanpa District is the only Bengali-speaking district in modern Nepal. Its spoken language is the Su&#x301;ryapurii branch of Ram&#x301;purii Bengali.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Now grammar has to be based on this change in language. Language does not derive its form from the rules and regulations of grammar. It is for precisely this reason that Panini had to maintain adjustment between the Vedic and Sanskrit languages when he was composing his grammar. Later on, however, Vopadeva composed his grammar in accordance with Laokika Sanskrit because by then the Vedic language had died out; it was as dead as a dodo.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->The old grammarians thought that the nominative case invariably uses the first case-ending. For example, in Bengali we have Ra&#x301;m ya&#x301;cche; in English &ldquo;Ram is going;&rdquo; in Sanskrit Ra&#x301;mah gacchati; and in Hindi Ra&#x301;m ja&#x301; raha&#x301; hae. In all of the aforementioned examples it can be seen that the nominative is the first case, but does that mean that it will always be the first case? No, it will not. In English the verbal noun, verbal adjective and gerund are used as the nominative. They are always nominative but not always the first case. In Bengali the nominative is used as the seventh case. For example &ndash;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..9"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Bhara&#x301; hate shu&#x301;nya bha&#x301;la jadi bharte ya&#x301;y<br>A&#x301;ge hate piche bha&#x301;la jadi da&#x301;ke ma&#x301;y<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Here ma&#x301;y is nominative, however it is not the first case but rather the seventh case. This clearly shows that the nominative does not have to be the first case. Still it is taught today in the schools that the nominative is the first case. Hence the grammar has to be recast. Va&#x301;p-kheda&#x301;no [driven away by the father], ma&#x301;-ta&#x301;r&#x301;a&#x301;no [chastised by the mother], or pa&#x301;gal ki na&#x301; bale [what won&#146;t a madman say], cha&#x301;gal ki na&#x301; kha&#x301;y [what won&#146;t a goat eat] can also be ba&#x301;pe kheda&#x301;no, ma&#x301;ye ta&#x301;r&#x301;a&#x301;no or pa&#x301;gale ki na&#x301; bale, cha&#x301;gale ki na&#x301; kha&#x301;y. In other words, there is no such rule that the nominative has to be in the first case.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->There are two conditions under which the nominative becomes the seventh case. First of all, the seventh case is used when an eternal truth or an historical truth is being explained, for example, pa&#x301;gale ki na&#x301; bale. Secondly, the seventh case is also used on the basis of what is important to an individual; that is, the case changes based on what way an individual expresses what they think. For example, &ldquo;da&#x301;da&#x301;re balla&#x301;m d&#x301;a&#x301;ha&#x301; ja&#x301;um&rdquo;; da&#x301;da&#x301;y balla &ldquo;ca&#x301;d&#x301;d&#x301;i va&#x301;t ka&#x301;iya&#x301; ja&#x301;o&rdquo;. Here da&#x301;da&#x301;y balla is used to express just how deep the elder brother&#146;s love is.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->D&#x301;a&#x301;ha&#x301; here refers to the city Dhaka. The word d&#x301;ha&#x301;ka&#x301; comes from the old word d&#x301;aba&#x301;k. This region was given the old name D&#x301;aba&#x301;k in the sense of &ldquo;oft-flooded land&rdquo;; it&#146;s other name was Vaun&#x32D;ga. The Vaun&#x32D;ga or D&#x301;aba&#x301;k of that time was composed of Mymensing District; Dhaka District; Faridpur District excepting Goyaland and Gopalganja; and the major portion of Bakharganj District. The heart of D&#x301;aba&#x301;k was Daboka&#x301; or D&#x301;a&#x301;ka&#x301;. There are some people who also say D&#x301;a&#x301;ha&#x301; instead of D&#x301;a&#x301;ka&#x301;. It is not true that the city&#146;s name became &ldquo;Dhaka&rdquo; because Emperor Jahangir was beating the drums [d&#x301;ha&#x301;k] while he was fixing the city limits. First of all, the actual name of the city is D&#x301;aka&#x301;, not D&#x301;ha&#x301;ka&#x301;. Furthermore, the name D&#x301;a&#x301;ka&#x301; is much, much older than Emperor Jahangir. The drums were being beaten during the setting of the city limits during the reign of Emperor Jahangir and it was said that from today the name of the city will be Jahangir Nagar. However the common folk did not like that name. They kept the old name D&#x301;a&#x301;ka&#x301; and still do. The name D&#x301;ha&#x301;keshvarii was given to Ramna&#x301; Ka&#x301;lii much later. Similarly, many Nawabs-Badshahs or so-called famous people gave the city a new name. Some of them were accepted by the public and some were not. The city of Mymensing was given the name Na&#x301;sira&#x301;ba&#x301;d (which the people did not accept); the old name of the heart of Shriibhu&#x301;mi was Shriihat&#x301;t&#x301;a which was made into Shilahat&#x301; (modern Sylhet &ndash; the people accepted it); Chittagong was given the name Islamabad (the people did not accept it); Burdwan was given the name Ba&#x301;r&#x301;-e-Dewa&#x301;n (the people did not accept it). The English name Burdwan comes from the name Ba&#x301;r&#x301;-e-Dewa&#x301;n. The ancient name Varddhama&#x301;n has been in use for the last two and a half thousand years. It was named after the spiritual guru of the Jains, Varddhama&#x301;n Maha&#x301;viira. The city&#146;s name before that was A&#x301;stikanagara &ndash; Attinagar in Pra&#x301;krta. Shriira&#x301;mpur was given the name Frederickstown. This name as well did not survive in the end. Hijli was given the name Madina&#x301;pur. That underwent distortion and became Mediniipur. However the Anglicized word &ldquo;Midnapore&rdquo; bears the stamp of Madina&#x301;pura. The Miina&#x301;pur locality of Navadviipa was changed into Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;pur thanks to the great Vaeshnava saints of that place.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Earlier I was saying that the nominative does not have to be the first case; that is, the relationship between case and case-ending is not a hard and fast one. Those who think that the sentence da&#x301;da&#x301;y balla is passive voice and has been put in the seventh case instead of the third case are mistaken. It is actually nominative and active voice. Similar is the case with na&#x301;ren&#x301;a uktam, which means &ldquo;said by a person&rdquo;, that is, the word nara is third case and the word &ldquo;person&rdquo; [ma&#x301;nus&#x301;a] is also clearly third case and is definitely not active voice. However, ma&#x301;nus&#x301;e bale and ma&#x301;nus&#x301;a bale [a person says] are both active voice. The difference between them is that ma&#x301;nus&#x301;e is active voice, seventh case. It is completely unjustifiable to consider ma&#x301;nus&#x301;e as either passive voice or third case because the meaning of ma&#x301;nus&#x301;e is not &ldquo;by a person&rdquo;. Furthermore, the verb-endings are not the same in active voice and passive voice. Vadati and ucyate are not the same. Similarly, if one says da&#x301;da&#x301;y balle, the word da&#x301;da&#x301; is understood to be seventh case, not third case. Here the verb is also clearly being used in active voice, not passive voice or impersonal voice. In Hindi this use of the seventh case instead of the first for the nominative does not happen. However if the word ne is added to the end of the subject the first case or the nominative case becomes objectified. This happens if there is a transitive verb with the subject, but the composition remains nominative. Although it appears to be the first case it is not actually so. In other words, the case becomes related to the accusative, second case.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->The Hindustani language prevalent in the markets of northern India is known as Urdu. This language gained acceptance as the language of government from the time of Shahja&#x301;ha&#x301;n. Since people who wore uniforms [urdi] used to speak this language its name became &ldquo;Urdu&rdquo; which means &ldquo;camp language&rdquo; or &ldquo;cantonment language&rdquo; &ndash; the language of a military camp. Evidence of this is fact that many cities of northern India still have an &ldquo;Urdu Bazaar&rdquo;. Those who are especially intolerant of Urdu have changed the name of these bazaars nowadays to &ldquo;Hindi Bazaar&rdquo; out of excessive zeal. They should understand that the name &ldquo;Urdu Bazaar&rdquo; does not refer to any specific language but rather to a military bazaar, or a bazaar made for the convenience of people who wore uniforms [urdi].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->I was saying that this Urdu or Hindustani language was made into Hindi by decreasing the amount of Arabic, Farsi and Turkish words and increasing the number of words derived or borrowed from Sanskrit, and it began to be written in Na&#x301;grii script instead of Farsi script. There is a rule in Hindustani (Hindi-Urdu) that the verb agrees with the subject. The verb-endings vary according to the number, person and gender of the subject. However if ne is added to the subject then the subject becomes half-objective and as a result the verb agrees with the gender of the object, for example, Ra&#x301;m rot&#x301;ii kha&#x301;ya&#x301;. Here the verb kha&#x301;ya&#x301; agrees with the subject. However if ne is added it becomes Ra&#x301;m ne rot&#x301;ii kha&#x301;yii. Since ne is attached to the subject, the verb-ending changes, because here the verb kha&#x301;yii agrees with the object rot&#x301;ii. However the number of the object follows the person. For example, Ra&#x301;m ne ek a&#x301;m kha&#x301;ya&#x301; [Ram ate one mango]. The plural of this is not Ra&#x301;m ne dash a&#x301;m kha&#x301;yen [Ram ate ten mangoes]. The verb-ending follows the gender of the object but not its number. The number will always be first person singular.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Recently, however, this rule is not being followed. Nowadays the verb is made to change according to the number of the object, even in the case of a sentence with ne added. In old Hindustani (Urdu) in such cases it would have been Ra&#x301;m ne ek a&#x301;m kha&#x301;ya&#x301;; Ra&#x301;m ne dash a&#x301;m kha&#x301;ya&#x301;. However now it has become Ra&#x301;m ne ek a&#x301;m kha&#x301;ya&#x301;; Ra&#x301;m ne dash a&#x301;m kha&#x301;yen. It seems that this kind of grammatical disorder has cropped up as a result of the control of the Hindustani language being in the hands of those for whom it is not their mother tongue or the language spoken at home.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->In old Hindustani the word a&#x301;m was used for both singular and plural. No special mark was used to indicate singular or plural in Hindustani in the case of fruits or vegetables. In other words, it could be understood whether it was singular or plural by the verb-ending or by the numerical words in the sentence, for example, ek a&#x301;lu, do a&#x301;lu, tin a&#x301;lu [one potato, two potatoes, three potatoes], etc. A&#x301;lu is a vegetable, hence it does not become a&#x301;luya&#x301;n in the plural. Similarly, a&#x301;m is a fruit so it will be ek a&#x301;m, do a&#x301;m, tin a&#x301;m and so on, not a&#x301;men. One kind of ol (&ldquo;elephant root&rdquo; in English; arum in Latin) is called jamiinkand in Hindi. The singular is jamiinkand and the plural as well.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->In Hindustani, when ne is added to the subject it no longer remains in the nominative case. It falls between the nominative and objective cases because in the radical change that occurs with the passive and impersonal voices it does not follow the rules of the nominative case but rather that of the objective, thus it can no longer be called nominative case. This kind of thing also happens to a certain extent in English. In English the change into the verbal noun, gerund and participle is effected by adding &ldquo;ing&rdquo; or &ldquo;ed&rdquo;. In the Angika language of Bihar the word nyay is used with the nominative. This, however, is not a synonym of the Hindustani ne. It is due to the use of this nyay that the verb does not undergo any alteration. Of course, in Angika the verb does not vary according to the gender and number of the subject. In this respect the rules of Angika resemble those of Bengali, for example, Ra&#x301;m kha&#x301;yche; Siita&#x301; kha&#x301;yche. In Angika this nyay is called caran&#x301;apu&#x301;rti [filling the foot]. It is necessary in the language in order to preserve rhythmic order. For example, if we say Ra&#x301;m nyay karla kai, Ra&#x301;m nyay remains in the nominative case and the nyay is caran&#x301;apu&#x301;rti. In Sanskrit caran&#x301;apu&#x301;rti is effected by using va, ca, ha, vae, and so on. In such cases the verb does not undergo any alteration. In Bengali as well go, ogo, lo, re, ore, he, etc. are used for the purposes of caran&#x301;apu&#x301;rti. They are also used as a note of address. If we translate a couplet from one of Rabindranath&#146;s poems it becomes:<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="13..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->Here ha has been used as caran&#x301;apu&#x301;rti. The usage of ne as seen in Hindustani is not prevalent in any other Indian language.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Now among the Indian languages, the verb forms change according to the number and gender of the subject in Ma&#x301;lavii Pra&#x301;krta, Paesha&#x301;cii Pra&#x301;krta and Shaorashren&#x301;ii Pra&#x301;krta but they do not in Ma&#x301;gadhii Pra&#x301;krta. In Panjabi, Marwari and Gujarati there are changes with gender and number but ne is not used as it is in Hindustani. Of course, it is true that ne is spoken in some places but that is more for the purposes of caran&#x301;apu&#x301;rti. There is no use of ne whatsoever in the old forms of these languages. For example in Marwari:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..23"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Sakhii re mya&#x301;ny to linii hari mola<br>Koi kahe sasto koi kahe ma&#x301;haunge<br>Lin&#x301;ii re tara&#x301;ja taola<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="13..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->Here ne could have just as easily been used in place of to, and in Hindustani it is used, but not in old Marwari. In Bhojpuri the verb changes according to the gender of the subject in certain places but ne is also not used, for example, ra&#x301;m calta&#x301;; siita&#x301; caltiiya&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->Ne is the objectivated counterpart of the subject. If ne is used, the subject gets so bound up with the predicate that it becomes difficult to separate them. If the object is feminine many people use karii in the case of the verbal root kr in a sentence with ne. For example, mya&#x301;n ne mula&#x301;ka&#x301;t karii. Actually in the case of a masculine word where kiya&#x301; or kiya&#x301; hae is used then kii or kii hae is used when it is feminine &ndash; not karii. The general rule is that if ne is used in the nominative case, feminine gender then the verb form that is used will remain the same in the objective case. In other words, here mya&#x301;n ne mula&#x301;ka&#x301;t kii is correct and proper. I do not find any logic to support the use of mya&#x301;n ne mula&#x301;ka&#x301;t karii, hence there is no alternative but to consider it incorrect.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->In Sanskrit the nominative case is closely linked to the first case and the verb-endings are based on the first case; it remains unaffected by the seventh. However in Sanskrit lat&#146;, lot&#146;, laun, vidhliun [present, imperative, past, conditional], etc. differ from one another in regards to time. If the modern prefix sma is added then the time changes to past tense. This is indeed considered to be change of time in the case however this does not indicate change in the sentence or the case-ending. Similarly, if a visarga-ending ta is used instead of using the fifth case then it follows the system of the ablative fifth case.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.13.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#13.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> But here also there is no change in the case or the sentence, as everybody knows.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->Most languages have fixed rules for adding case-endings and verb-endings. However in Sanskrit, and occasionally in some Latin-derived languages, there is no such rule. In Sanskrit the change in the word form is based on the vowel ending. The words nara and dadhi do not follow the same forms because they end in different vowels; the change in gender is also based on this. It is, of course, for this reason that it requires some perseverance to remember the innumerable word forms that occur in Sanskrit due to vowel-endings and gender differences. One can point this out as a deficiency in Sanskrit though I certainly would not because it is neither odd nor surprising for this kind of thing to be present in a language recognized for its facility. Learning the word form for nara does not help one to translate da&#x301;da&#x301;ke da&#x301;o because the word form da&#x301;da&#x301; is not like the word form nara. In the case of Sanskrit this extra expenditure in effort cannot be avoided. In my book Basic Sanskrit I also did not meddle with the word forms but in another way I moulded masculine words ending in a after the declension of nara by using numerical suffixes like dvaya, traya, gan&#x301;a, samu&#x301;ha, etc. Take, for example, the singular ba&#x301;lakah gacchati and the dual ba&#x301;lakao gacchatah &ndash; instead of writing these forms we can write ba&#x301;lakadvayah gacchati. This is an easy means of learning popular Sanskrit without compromising the fundamental framework of the Sanskrit language. In this way one only needs to learn ti, si, mi, that is, the verb-endings only change according to person, not according to number. Even if the word endings are not directly simplified, by using the suffixes ending in a one is saved from having to learn different word endings.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->It would be quite good if students first become skilled in reading, writing and speaking Sanskrit by learning Basic Sanskrit through Roman script before going on to learn advanced Sanskrit or literary Sanskrit. On one hand it would be easier for the students, and on the other the use of Sanskrit would become more widespread.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->Anyhow I was talking about the use of the seventh case in Bengali. When the nominative remains in the seventh case in Bengali then it becomes similar to ka&#x301;la&#x301;dhikaran&#x301;a, a&#x301;dha&#x301;ra&#x301;dhikaran&#x301;a and bha&#x301;va&#x301;dhikaran&#x301;a [the locatives of time, base and idea]. Because of this I have said that the grammar will have to be recast. When the society, economy and everything else have to be newly ordered, then why not the grammar as well! If the new cannot be newly accepted then with the passage of time it becomes useless; it becomes outdated [ta&#x301;ma&#x301;di].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->The word ta&#x301;ma&#x301;di that I have just used is a Farsi word. There are a great number of these kinds of Farsi words in Bengali. Some are present in unaltered form and some have become somewhat altered. Earlier I said that na&#x301;-va&#x301;lig is a Farsi word. After undergoing alteration it became na&#x301;ba&#x301;lak. Na&#x301;ba&#x301;lak is not a Sanskrit word, nor is it Farsi. Sa&#x301;ba&#x301;lak, and so on have been made in the same way as na&#x301;ba&#x301;lak. The Farsi word na&#x301;-va&#x301;lig means &ldquo;young, minor&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->The word prasra&#x301;va [urine], which is used in Bengali, does not exist in Sanskrit. The Sanskrit scholars fashioned it out of the Farsi word pesh-a&#x301;b. The Farsi word pesh means &ldquo;to put in front&rdquo;. &ldquo;One who puts&rdquo; is called peshka&#x301;r, that is, &ldquo;one who does pesh&rdquo;. The Farsi word a&#x301;b means &ldquo;water&rdquo;. Farsi is a Vedic descendant. In Vedic the word ap means &ldquo;water&rdquo;. In Farsi the Vedic ap has become a&#x301;b. Thus the Farsi word pesha&#x301;b means &ldquo;to put water in front&rdquo;. The Sanskrit pandits refined the word and made it prasra&#x301;va. They wanted to show that the word was derived pra &ndash; srav + ghain&#x32D; = prasra&#x301;va. The word anushiilana, for example, is not a Sanskrit word; it is native Bengali. However an effort was made to show that it was derived anu &ndash; shiil +anat&#x301;. The word prasra&#x301;va was presented in the exact same way. Actually prasra&#x301;va is not a Sanskrit word, thus it will not work in Sanskrit. The educated communities of north India do not use the word prasra&#x301;va; they say laghusham&#x301;ka&#x301;. In Sanskrit the word mu&#x301;tratya&#x301;ga can and should be used, not prasra&#x301;va. The word prasravan&#x301;a that is used in Sanskrit means &ldquo;fountain&rdquo;. It is not related to the word prasra&#x301;va.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->Other names for water in the Vedic language are jalam&#x301;, kambalam&#x301;, jiivanam&#x301;, pa&#x301;niiyam&#x301;, niiram&#x301;, toyam&#x301;, udakam, and so on. Water is a common word. It can be potable or non-potable, but the word pa&#x301;niiyam refers only to drinking water. The word pa&#x301;nii is used in all Hindi-speaking areas. Just as drain water is called dren ka&#x301; pa&#x301;nii, similarly rain water is also called pa&#x301;nii. But they are not all drinkable. Only potable water or water that can be drunk should be called pa&#x301;nii because the word pa&#x301;nii comes from the Sanskrit word pa&#x301;niiyam. The word a&#x301;pa is derived from the word ap. A&#x301;pa means &ldquo;action&rdquo;. Since all sorts of actions are performed with the help of ap, or water, one name for action is a&#x301;pa.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Five&rdquo; in Farsi is painj. The region where there are five rivers is called painj + a&#x301;b = pain&#x32D;ja&#x301;b. The land lying between the Ganges and the Yamuna rivers, which was called Brahma&#x301;vartta or Brahmars&#x301;i in ancient times and Shu&#x301;rasena or the kingdom of Mathura in medieval times, is called do-a&#x301;b in Farsi. The word pain&#x32D;ja&#x301;b is not actually a proper noun since it means &ldquo;a grouping of five rivers&rdquo;.

<a name="13..37"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=37 type=paragraph -->What we refer to by the Bengali word gela&#x301;s is called a &ldquo;tumbler&rdquo; in English. When a tumbler is made out of glass then it is called a &ldquo;glass tumbler&rdquo;. This has become simply gela&#x301;s in Bengali. Thus the English &ldquo;glass&rdquo; is not the same as gela&#x301;s. If we say ek gela&#x301;s jal a&#x301;no in Bengali, its English translation will be &ldquo;fetch me a tumbler of water&rdquo;, not a &ldquo;glass of water&rdquo;. &ldquo;Glass of water&rdquo; was not used in old English.

Another word used in the military, &ldquo;surrender&rdquo;, has become sa&#x301;la&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;a&#x301;r in Panjabi.

<a name="13..41"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=41 type=paragraph -->There is one more thing to keep in mind in this regard. In English the suffix &ldquo;er&rdquo; is used where Sanskrit uses the suffix d&#x301;a, for example, the English &ldquo;do-er&rdquo;, &ldquo;go-er&rdquo;, &ldquo;se-er&rdquo;, and so on. In Sanskrit the suffix d&#x301;a is added to the verbal root trae to make tra (trae + d&#x301;a = tra). On the other hand, if the suffix shatr is added to the verbal root gae it makes ga&#x301;yat. Hence ga&#x301;yat + tra = ga&#x301;yattra, and if the feminine iip is added it forms ga&#x301;yattrii. Ga&#x301;yattrii should be spelled by conjuncting ra to the second ta because one ta belongs to ga&#x301;yat and the other belongs to tra. However many people spell ga&#x301;yattrii with a single ta. Similarly put + tra = puttra. One ta belongs to put and the other to tra. Thus puttra is also spelled with two &ldquo;ta&#146;s&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>

However, before talking about the second case, a little more remains to be said about the first case because often the first case can also be used in situations where the second case is used. Hence karmman&#x301;i dvitiiya&#x301; [the accusative is the second case] in accordance with the Sanskrit rule does not always hold true in Bengali. Sah odanam bhaks&#x301;ayati. Here odanam is in the second case.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The Bengali word bha&#x301;t [cooked rice] comes from the Pra&#x301;krta word bhatta, that is, the word bha&#x301;t is Pra&#x301;krta-derived, not Sanskrit-derived. It is said that the Bengali vocabulary contains words derived from Sanskrit, borrowed from Sanskrit, altered borrowings from Sanskrit, foreign words and native Bengali words. However there has been an effort to disregard the fact that Bengali also contains words either derived or borrowed from Pra&#x301;krta, and this is not proper. The word bha&#x301;t comes from the Pra&#x301;krta word bhatta. From sah bhattam kha&#x301;dati comes the Pra&#x301;krta sa bhattam kha&#x301;ati &larr; sa bhatta kha&#x301;ai &larr; se bha&#x301;t kha&#x301;y. In other words, bhattam is a four thousand year old Pra&#x301;krta word. The native Sanskrit word for bha&#x301;t is not bhattam but odanam. The Sanskrit word for ca&#x301;l [uncooked rice] is tan&#x301;d&#x301;ula and the Sanskrit word for bha&#x301;t is odanam. In the olden days, when the Aryans first came into contact with paddy, they were as yet unacquainted with the husking pedal. They learned to use a wooden mortar for husking the paddy. When they used to pound the paddy in the mortar the rice would jump out; thus they gave rice the name tan&#x301;d&#x301;ula which means &ldquo;that whose nature is to jump&rdquo;. The dance which demonstrates a proclivity for jumping we call ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava. However the word ca&#x301;l is pure Bengali or native Bengali. That which we get from sifting [ca&#x301;la&#x301;] in a strainer or winnowing platter is ca&#x301;l. Ca&#x301;l does not refer only to what we get from paddy; we also say dhaner ca&#x301;l [ca&#x301;l of coriander]. In old Bengali there was a practice of pronouncing long ao or long u&#x301; after a&#x301; thus ca&#x301;l in some places became ca&#x301;ol and in some places ca&#x301;ul and elsewhere ca&#x301;ur (Angika, Magahii, Maethilii).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->At any rate, sah odanam bhaks&#x301;ayati (karmman&#x301;i dvitiiya&#x301;) &ndash; Sanskrit has this rule, but in Sanskrit the second case is also used in situations that are not accusative or half-accusative. In Bengali, Hindi and English, however, this never happens. In English the work of the second case is performed by the preposition &ldquo;to&rdquo;. Often the word &ldquo;to&rdquo; is implied in an English sentence. At such times the case must be understood by context. This also happens in Bengali. In Sanskrit the matter of the accusative case is not altogether clear because often the second case-ending is used despite the fact that it is not accusative. For example, the second case-ending is employed when adding the words prati, anu, dhik, nikas&#x301;a&#x301;, antara&#x301;, antaren&#x301;a and ya&#x301;vat (pratyanudhiun&#x32D;g-nikasa&#x301;-ntara&#x301;-ntaren&#x301;a-ya&#x301;vadbhih). However there is no explanation as to why it is so. They are proved by usage, that is, they are in the su&#x301;tra thus they must be so used. Bengali is not like this. In Bengali you will have to depend on the context of the sentence to determine when it is in the second case. Furthermore, according to the usage it can become the seventh in place of the second. And sometimes in Bengali, if the passive voice and the impersonal voice change into the active voice, it becomes the first case nominative. Thus the Sanskrit rule karmman&#x301;i dvitiiya&#x301; does not apply to Bengali.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Moreover, in Sanskrit the second case-ending is also used in the locative case. For example, ka&#x301;la&#x301;dhvanaratyanatasam&#x301;yoge. &ndash; &ldquo;such a long time, such a long way&rdquo; &ndash; if this kind of meaning is understood then the second case-ending is used although actually it falls within the jurisdiction of the locative case. In Sanskrit the third case-ending is used for the same reason if the completion of the action and the completion of the effect are indicated. Young children memorize without understanding the correct meaning. If they understand the meaning then there is no need for memorization. If they memorize without understanding then they forget. Thus I do not accept the opinion of olden times about the necessity of memorization. In those days they used to say a&#x301;vrttih sarvasha&#x301;stra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;m&#x301; bodha&#x301;dapi gariiyasii [the recitation of scriptures is better than grasping their meaning].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->In Sanskrit the third case-ending indicates apavarga. Apavarga means that the action has been completed and its results have also been obtained. If the action is not completed then the second case is used; if the action has been completed it changes to the third case. Actually both situations are locative. However, by being bound to the su&#x301;tra either the second or the third case is stipulated. Yojanam pustakam adhiitam &ndash; here yojanam is in the second case because it indicates that the reading has not been completed. But if one says yojanena pustakam adhiitam it becomes the third case because it means that the book has been read and the knowledge that was to be acquired from the book has been acquired.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->In Bengali if one says ramer prati se asanttas&#x301;t&#x301;a then ra&#x301;m is in the sixth case but in Sanskrit it becomes ra&#x301;mam&#x301; prati, that is, second case, because it says in the su&#x301;tra that if prati is present then the second case is used. Hindi is similar to Bengali. For example, mere liye, ra&#x301;mke liye, etc. Due to the meaning the action is effected in the sixth case. Se ra&#x301;sta&#x301;y khete khete ja&#x301;cche. Ra&#x301;sta&#x301;y means &ldquo;in the road&rdquo;; thus the seventh case-ending is used in Bengali and it is clearly the locative case.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Now the question arises: if the second case-ending is used in Sanskrit then why is it different in Bengali? The reason is that they are different languages, although Sanskrit is the source of Bengali. Of course, secondarily we can also say that Sanskrit is no longer the spoken language of the common people so its days of undergoing transformation have come to an end. It is bound by the iron fetters of grammar while Bengali is a flowing river which moves forward by virtue of its own vital energy, breaking the dams, overflowing the banks, devastating and recreating the countryside. Grammar is unable to bind it with its hard and fast rules. Grammar is like leg-irons on the legs of Sanskrit while it is like ankle-bells on the ankles of Bengali.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->A further point is that Sanskrit is the language of the scholars. What to speak of the general populace, how many people are there for whom this language actually reflects their inner psychology! This inner psychology is not easily understood by the general people, thus the obvious difference. The same situation occurs in the case of Latin as well. I have observed that if you speak simple Latin with those who still use a little Latin in the church today, they have difficulty in understanding. In other words, Latin is their language of worship; it is their Venus in a distant sky. Latin is not something you can hold in your hand &ndash; even if Latin has its historical ties, it has been severed from the veins and arteries.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->In Sanskrit karmman&#x301;i dvitiiya&#x301; [the accusative is the second case] but not in Bengali. In Hindi and Urdu the accusative is the second case and also the seventh. For example, mujhko dena&#x301; and mujhe dena&#x301;, mujhko ma&#x301;lum nehii and mujhe ma&#x301;lum nehii &ndash; it is both second and seventh. Often in Bengali, where the second or the seventh case should have been used, it is changed into the active voice, and in such instances the active voice uses the first case-ending. This is done in the case of feelings and perceptions but an exception is made for taste. In the case of feelings one says a&#x301;ma&#x301;r bhay la&#x301;gche [I feel afraid]. In the active voice it becomes a&#x301;mi bhay pa&#x301;cchi. But in the case of taste one says a&#x301;ma&#x301;r t&#x301;ak la&#x301;gche [it tastes sour] or a&#x301;ma&#x301;ke t&#x301;ak la&#x301;gche or a&#x301;ma&#x301;y t&#x301;ak la&#x301;gche. In this case there is no scope for saying something like a&#x301;mi t&#x301;ak la&#x301;gche [first case]. However with feelings this kind of thing can be done &ndash; a&#x301;ma&#x301;r bha&#x301;la la&#x301;ge [I like it], a&#x301;ma&#x301;ke bha&#x301;la la&#x301;ge or a&#x301;mi bha&#x301;la bujhi. A&#x301;ma&#x301;r bha&#x301;la la&#x301;ge &ndash; here I am using the vocative case. A&#x301;mar bha&#x301;la la&#x301;gche, a&#x301;ma&#x301;y bha&#x301;la la&#x301;gche &ndash; both of these can be used but a&#x301;ma&#x301;ke bha&#x301;la la&#x301;gche is more correct. This is Rarhi Bengali. Here the accusative is in effect, thus the second case. Whatever is being used in the living language has to be accepted as correct. A grammar created in imitation of an old language cannot be accepted as correct. Six hundred years ago &ldquo;thou&rdquo; was used to mean &ldquo;you&rdquo;, but nowadays it has practically vanished. Now &ldquo;you&rdquo; is used in place of &ldquo;thou&rdquo;. In those days &ldquo;thou&rdquo; was used in the singular and &ldquo;you&rdquo; in the plural, however nowadays &ldquo;you&rdquo; is used for both singular and plural. In the case of the singular, &ldquo;is&rdquo; was correct and there is no logic to support the use of the plural verb &ldquo;are&rdquo; for the singular but it is used because the people have accepted its usage. In French at one time the word tu was used for the polite form of &ldquo;you&rdquo;, now vous is used.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->The Sanskrit word bhava&#x301;n has now been replaced by tvam. Bhava&#x301;n has practically disappeared nowadays. The word bhava&#x301;n is a little like the Farsi word tashrif. The exact meaning of the word bhava&#x301;n is not tumi [you &ndash; familiar form] or tvam, nor is it a&#x301;pani [you &ndash; polite form]. It signifies &ldquo;your greatness&rdquo;. Like the Farsi a&#x301;iye tashrif la&#x301;iye, bhava&#x301;n kim&#x301; karoti, means &ldquo;What is your greatness doing?&rdquo;. Here bhava&#x301;n is third person singular. &ldquo;Your greatness&rdquo; is the addressee, thus the verb form is third person singular. Sanskrit bhava&#x301;n &rarr; Pra&#x301;krta appana (the thirty-five hundred year old form) &rarr; Angika apne &rarr; Bengali a&#x301;pani.

<a name="14..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->I was saying that for feelings the first case is used. In Calcutta Bengali one says a&#x301;mi bha&#x301;laba&#x301;si and in Rarhi Bengali one says mu bha&#x301;laba&#x301;si. In Calcutta Bengali we use the verb ba&#x301;si when we say a&#x301;mi bha&#x301;laba&#x301;si but there is no other instance in which the verb ba&#x301;si is used. However in Rarhi Bengali the verb ba&#x301;si is always used for feelings. For example, mui bha&#x301;laba&#x301;si [I love], mui la&#x301;j ba&#x301;si [I feel shy], mui d&#x301;ar ba&#x301;si [I&#146;m afraid], mui ja&#x301;r&#x301; ba&#x301;si [I feel cold], and so on. The verb ba&#x301;si is a Rarhi Bengali verb. In Calcutta la&#x301;j ba&#x301;si, d&#x301;ar ba&#x301;si, ja&#x301;r&#x301; ba&#x301;si, etc. are not used. Anyhow, the use of the third person active voice for feelings and perceptions does not hold for tastes. In other words, I have not seen a&#x301;mi jha&#x301;l [spicy] ba&#x301;si, a&#x301;mi t&#x301;ak [sour] ba&#x301;si, and so on, being used.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->In many languages the second case is used to denote direction.

Se kalka&#x301;ta&#x301;y tha&#x301;ke [He stays in Calcutta] &ndash; here kalaka&#x301;ta&#x301;y is locative, thus the use of the seventh case. However if we say se kalka&#x301;ta&#x301;y ja&#x301;cche [He is going to Calcutta] it indicates direction. Here, although we write it with the seventh case-ending, the seventh is actually used for the second. In English we use &ldquo;to&rdquo; in the phrase &ldquo;He is going to Calcutta&rdquo;. It is the second case. In Oriya and Rarhi Bengali the second case is used. For example, in central Rarhi one says gharke ja&#x301;va [I will go home]. In Oriya it is gharku jivi. Similarly, kutha&#x301;ke gelche go? &ndash; gha&#x301;t&#x301;ke gelche [Where has he gone? He has gone home].<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="14..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->In these circumstances the second case is not used in standard Bengali. The seventh or the first case is used instead. For example, se varddhama&#x301;n ja&#x301;cche or else se varddhama&#x301;ne ja&#x301;cche [He is going to Burdwan]. We say Ra&#x301;m ba&#x301;r&#x301;ii ja&#x301;cche [Ra&#x301;m is going home], not Ra&#x301;m ba&#x301;r&#x301;iike ja&#x301;cche. Ba&#x301;r&#x301;ii is accusative but the first case-ending is used. One has to apply one&#146;s intellect in order to determine when the seventh case indicating presence is being used, or when it is the first case implying the nominative, or when it is the seventh indicating direction, and so on. If one says Ra&#x301;m bha&#x301;t kha&#x301;cche then one has to use one&#146;s intellect to understand whether Ram is eating the rice or whether the rice is eating Ram. The eater is the nominative and that which is being eaten is the accusative. When one says &ldquo;He is going to Calcutta&rdquo; in English, then &ldquo;to&rdquo; is used to make it accusative, but in &ldquo;He is drinking water&rdquo; neither &ldquo;to&rdquo; nor any other preposition is used although &ldquo;water&rdquo; is accusative. &ldquo;Ram&rdquo; is in the nominative although as with &ldquo;water&rdquo; there is no preposition either before or after to indicate this. In old English &ldquo;to&rdquo;, &ldquo;toward&rdquo;, &ldquo;unto&rdquo;, &ldquo;upon&rdquo;, &ldquo;on&rdquo; were used in the second case. Nowadays this is no longer so much the case, although in refined English this usage still continues to some extent.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->In Oriya and Rarhi Bengali if direction is not implied then karmman&#x301;i dvitiiya&#x301; usage is not in force. In Rarhi Bengali Siita&#x301; jalke ja&#x301;vek [Sita will go to the water] but Siita&#x301; bha&#x301;t khecche [Sita is eating rice]. Here bha&#x301;tke khecche is not used because direction is not implied. In the majority of cases in Hindi karmman&#x301;i dvitiiya&#x301; is not followed regardless of whether or not direction is implied. In such cases the accusative has to be recognized although the second case-ending is not employed. For example, Ra&#x301;m bha&#x301;t kha&#x301; raha&#x301; hae [Ram is eating rice] is used rather than Ra&#x301;m bha&#x301;tko kha&#x301; raha&#x301; hae (In Hindi both bha&#x301;t and ca&#x301;val are common), that is, it is accusative but the second case-ending is not employed. In the spoken language of certain areas near Delhi the second case is used but it is not used in the written language. For example, one says a&#x301;pko kanha&#x301;ko ja&#x301;na&#x301; hae but it is written a&#x301;pko ka&#x301;nha&#x301; ja&#x301;na&#x301;. And in Hindi if ne is added then the verb changes according to the gender of the object. One has to remember that the verb does not change according to the gender of the subject but rather according to the gender of the object. Thus I said that when ne is added the doership of the subject no longer remains. It is transformed into the half-accusative case and the object also does not remain accusative. It is transformed into the half-nominative. In the case of feelings also, Hindi and Urdu use the second case &ndash; if not in all situations then certainly in most. For example, bakreka&#x301; pasiinda&#x301; a&#x301;pko pasand hae na&#x301;. In Bengali in such an example the sixth case is generally employed, not the second, although there is some difference from dialect to dialect.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->In Hindi and Urdu one does not use the second case to indicate direction. In Hindi one says Vah ghar ja&#x301; raha&#x301; hae [He is going home] &ndash; not gharko. However in the chaste Hindi of some areas near Delhi ko is used. For example, a&#x301;pko ka&#x301;nha&#x301;ko ja&#x301;na&#x301; hae jii [Where are you going, sir?]? Adding ko is correct from the grammatical point of view but it is omitted when writing. So one can say mujhko dena&#x301; in Hindi for &ldquo;give me&rdquo; but the idiomatic expression is mujhe dena&#x301;. And nowadays one says mereko dena&#x301; jii but one writes mujhe dena&#x301;. In the same way mujhko ma&#x301;lum nehii [I don&#146;t know] is not altogether wrong from the grammatical point of view, however mujhe ma&#x301;lum nehii, that is, the seventh case, is more proper.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Let us move on to the third case. It is said karan&#x301;e trtiiya&#x301;, that is, the instrumental case is the third case. Is this always so? In Sanskrit it is. There is a Sanskrit su&#x301;tra which says sahayoge trtiiya&#x301;, that is, by adding the word saha [with] we get the third case. This does not hold true in Bengali. In Sanskrit one says bhava&#x301;n maya&#x301; saha calatu but in Bengali we say a&#x301;ma&#x301;r saunge calun [come with me]. In other words, in Bengali we get the sixth case genitive by adding saha. Thus in Bengali the rule that the instrumental case is always the third case does not hold true. If anyone says this in Bengali they will be mistaken, nor is it a fact that it is the gospel truth in Sanskrit either. In English one says &ldquo;come with me&rdquo;, that is, the second case. In Hindi and Urdu one says mere sa&#x301;th a&#x301; ja&#x301;o. Here it is the sixth case. Thus adding the word saha does not always make it the third case.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->This reminds me of something concerning the learning of languages. The spoken language must be also learned while one is learning a language.

<a name="14..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->One has to study the spoken language while learning a language but it seems that spoken English is not properly taught in the English courses in schools and colleges. Moreover it is important to study idiomatic expressions when studying English. I have heard a Bengali professor say kya&#x301;val, a&#x301;slo, ise, ca&#x301;d, pha&#x301;d, pa&#x301;c, giyechila&#x301;m na&#x301; [various mistakes]. Those who are teaching others should pay a little attention to what they themselves are doing. They should especially steer clear from vulgar mistakes in their pronunciation. Sha, s&#x301;a and sa should be correctly pronounced. Pronouncing mess &ldquo;mech&rdquo;, recent &ldquo;rechent&rdquo;, etc. is reprehensible.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->In Bengali also there are differences in the spoken language. To indicate many things together we use the plural word guli in Bengali. In south Bengal they say guli for the plural; in Rarh they say gula&#x301;n (for example, in the spoken language of Birbhum: cha&#x301;galgula&#x301;n ba&#x301;ndha&#x301; railen, ma&#x301; t&#x301;ha&#x301;krun&#x301; dekho [look mother, the goats were tied up]); in north Bengal gur&#x301;i; and in east Bengal gulon. In Calcutta Bengali guli is used respectfully and gulo disrespectfully. For example, chelegulo baka&#x301;t&#x301;e haye geche [the boys have become wayward]; cheleguli kata bha&#x301;la [How good those boys are!].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->There are also differences regarding the use of na&#x301; in a negative sentence in the spoken Bengali of certain areas. Na&#x301; is placed after the verb in all areas except where Ram&#x301;puri and Rarhi Bengali is spoken; in Rarhi and Ram&#x301;puri Bengali it can go either before or after the verb. For example in Rarhi Bengali one can say mui pa&#x301;irabu na&#x301;i (pa&#x301;irabo is also common) or mui na&#x301;i pa&#x301;irabu &ndash; in Ram&#x301;purii mu na&#x301; pa&#x301;rim or mu pa&#x301;rima na&#x301;. It should be remembered that na&#x301; always goes after the verb in standard Bengali. In some important languages the na&#x301; goes before the verb. Bengali is more or less an exception. For example, &ldquo;I will not go&rdquo;, maen nehii ja&#x301;un&#x32D;ga&#x301;, aham&#x301; na gamisya&#x301;mi, hamma nyay ja&#x301;ivek, ham na ja&#x301;iva, but in Bengali a&#x301;mi ja&#x301;va na&#x301;.

<a name="14..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->Anyhow, I was talking about the third case. In Sanskrit saha is added in the instrumental, and for other cases it is the third. In Bengali there are few examples of the work of the instrumental being done by another but occasionally its job is managed by using the words saunge or ka&#x301;che. For example: Se ra&#x301;ks&#x301;aser viruddhe lar&#x301;a&#x301;i karche [He is fighting with the demon.]. We can also say it this way: Se ra&#x301;ks&#x301;aser saunge lar&#x301;a&#x301;i karche. Likewise, Toma&#x301;der parer kla&#x301;s ki a&#x301;ma&#x301;r ka&#x301;che a&#x301;che? [Is your next class with me?]. In all of these the word &ldquo;with&rdquo; is used in English. But in English the meaning of the sentence changes depending on the preposition. For example, &ldquo;put off&rdquo;, &ldquo;put on&rdquo;, &ldquo;read&rdquo;, &ldquo;read out&rdquo;, and so on. Thus prepositions must be used carefully. When the container is referred to then either &ldquo;with&rdquo; or &ldquo;in&rdquo; can be used, but when the contained is referred to then &ldquo;in&rdquo; is used. For example, &ldquo;The Sundarbans abound in (or &lsquo;with&rsquo;) tigers.&rdquo; In this case the Sundarbans is the container. But &ldquo;Tigers abound in the Sundarbans&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->I have just said that if one does not know how to use prepositions correctly in English then it creates ambiguity or confusion. When there is a comparison between two entities then the word &ldquo;between&rdquo; is used, for example, &ldquo;between Ram and Shyam&rdquo;. However if the comparison is between more than two then the words &ldquo;among&rdquo; or &ldquo;amongst&rdquo; are used. Nevertheless, nowadays one easily uses any of these when and where one wishes. There is nothing anyone can say about it.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->The same kind of waywardness in the use of words can be seen in spelling as well. Due to an improper understanding of prefix, root word and suffix, many letters are considered extraneous and get omitted. This happens in English more than anywhere else. &ldquo;Co&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;nect&rdquo; + &ldquo;ion&rdquo; = &ldquo;connection&rdquo;. Those who are unacquainted with the root throw out letters as they please that they consider extraneous when they spell it. For example, &ldquo;conexion&rdquo;. Similarly, &ldquo;labour&rdquo;, &ldquo;honor&rdquo; or &ldquo;onor&rdquo;, putting a small &ldquo;i&rdquo; in place of a capital &ldquo;I&rdquo;, &ldquo;yoghurt&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;curd&rdquo; and so on. Of course, when it comes to spelling one should follow the rules. If not it creates confusion. This confusion will harm the literature and consequently the social consciousness will suffer.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->In the case of comparison, when two entities are of the same kind then &ldquo;compare with&rdquo; is used, for example, a comparison of the Alps with the Himalayas. However when two things of opposing natures are compared, for example, the Himalayas and the Indian Ocean, then &ldquo;compare to&rdquo; is used. Of course, an English synonym for &ldquo;compare to&rdquo; is &ldquo;contrast&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->Even many educated people confuse the use of the English prepositions &ldquo;in&rdquo;, &ldquo;on&rdquo;, and &ldquo;to&rdquo;. For instance, the Punjab, Pakistan and Iran are all west in regards to India. However three different prepositions will be used to indicate this. Although the Punjab is in the west, it is within India, thus &ldquo;The Punjab is in the west&rdquo;; Pakistan is outside India but it is bordering India, thus it will be &ldquo;on the west&rdquo;; and Iran is west but not bordering, that is, there is a separation, thus it is &ldquo;to the west&rdquo;. Bear in mind that even though Punjab appears to be a proper noun, &ldquo;the&rdquo; is placed before it, that is, it is written &ldquo;the Punjab&rdquo; because the word pain&#x32D;ja&#x301;b means &ldquo;a collection of the waters of five rivers&rdquo;. Thus although it is a proper noun, it is not a true proper noun. Along with &ldquo;to&rdquo;, &ldquo;upon&rdquo;, &ldquo;on&rdquo;, &ldquo;unto&rdquo;, &ldquo;into&rdquo;, etc. are indicators of the second case in English. They are extensively used in Biblical English, however by the late Victorian age the use of &ldquo;unto&rdquo; had practically ceased and the use of &ldquo;upon&rdquo; had diminished significantly. There is, however, a need for both &ldquo;upon&rdquo; and &ldquo;into&rdquo; to remain in use. In olden times &ldquo;into&rdquo; was used in the sense of going inside from outside and &ldquo;in&rdquo; was used for &ldquo;remaining inside&rdquo;. For example, &ldquo;He is entering into the room&rdquo;. Similarly there was a significant difference between &ldquo;on&rdquo; and &ldquo;upon&rdquo; as well. &ldquo;On&rdquo; meant &ldquo;above but touching&rdquo; while &ldquo;upon&rdquo; meant &ldquo;above but not touching&rdquo;. &ldquo;The glass is on the table&rdquo; but &ldquo;The ceiling fan is upon the table&rdquo;. I have just said that in modern English &ldquo;unto&rdquo; is no longer used and &ldquo;upon&rdquo; is falling into disuse. &ldquo;Into&rdquo; is also being used less. Naturally there is nothing to say about what is happening but it will lead to difficulty in expression and ambiguity or confusion.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->The other day I talked about the use of Farsi words in Bengali. At that time I mentioned that Farsi words have entered Bengali to such an extent that it is futile to try to keep them out of the language.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->The Bengali word a&#x301;ka&#x301;damii is originally Farsi &ndash; a&#x301;ka&#x301;damii in Farsi and &ldquo;academy&rdquo; in English. Similarly, the Vedic vriihi became rici in Latin and its English derivation is &ldquo;rice&rdquo;. I have seen many pandits try to pass off the word a&#x301;ka&#x301;damii as Latin. Of course, the word is now Latin but it was originally Farsi. Although the word nocturn is considered Latin it comes from the Vedic word nactram. Among other Farsi words, we have ha&#x301;ma&#x301;n-dista&#x301; and mashalla&#x301;. The substance called &ldquo;vinegar&rdquo; which is used in cooking nowadays is known as sirka&#x301; (chirka&#x301;) in Farsi. The word pa&#x301;ya&#x301; [officer, rank] is also a Farsi word but the word pinr&#x301;i is a native Bengali word (in some places people say pinr&#x301;e also). The word shala&#x301;h from the Bengali word shala&#x301;para&#x301;marsha is Farsi and it means &ldquo;advice&rdquo; &ndash; shala&#x301;h-i para&#x301;marsha &ndash; shala&#x301;h-para&#x301;marsha (nityasama&#x301;sa). The ta&#x301;bij [armlet] that one ties around the wrist is also a Farsi word. In addition to these there are many more Farsi words in Bengali. Most of them have entered Bengali in altered form or else have undergone alteration after becoming Bengali or else an effort has been made to change them into Sanskrit. Whatever the case may be, it is better not to try to remove them from Bengali.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="15..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->I have already discussed the second case to some extent. Now let us see how far it is meaningful to link the second case with the accusative. Let us also see to what extent the second case has a right to its claim to be a separate case.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Ra&#x301;m bha&#x301;t kha&#x301;cche [Ram is eating rice] &ndash; as far as case goes both Ra&#x301;m and bha&#x301;t are in the first case but bha&#x301;t is accusative. We do not say bha&#x301;tke kha&#x301;cche; we say bha&#x301;t khacche. In the active voice there is a direct syntactic relationship between the subject and the verb; thus the subject has to be present. The existence of the subject remains substantiated without the presence of an object but without the subject the existence of the object cannot be substantiated. In the passive voice and the impersonal voice the syntactic relationship between subject and object is indirect. For example, a&#x301;ma&#x301;r dva&#x301;ra&#x301; dekha hayeche [It has been seen by me]. It is for this reason that the first case has been placed first in the sentence.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Now the question arises, why does the first case-ending precede the second case-ending? Why is the second case-ending not first?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->This same question can be asked of the alphabet. Why does the letter a come before the letter a&#x301; in the list of vowels? Similarly, why does ka come before kha among the consonants? The reason is that a is the acoustic root of creation. Because a is the first sound in the creation it has been placed at the beginning of the alphabet. If two a&#146;s are joined together then they become a&#x301;. It is not enough that they are placed one after the other; they have to be joined together.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->In the case of the consonants, ka is an unaspirated letter. When ha is added to ka it creates the aspirated letter kha. Children and less-educated adults feel difficulty pronouncing the aspirated letters such as kha, gha, cha, etc. One reason is that the unaspirated letter is placed before its concerning aspirate. Another is that in the error-filled vulgar language the aspirates are, for all practical purposes, not pronounced. For example, kha&#x301;iya&#x301; ja&#x301;o is pronounced ka&#x301;iya&#x301; ja&#x301;o. In other words, in this case the aspirate is pronounced as an unaspirated letter.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Among the twelve dialects of Bengali, there are four in which one can say that there is, for all intents and purposes, no pronunciation of the aspirates. In two dialects there is partial pronunciation and in the remaining dialects they are pronounced. But this is not to say that they are always pronounced in those dialects. For instance, there is proper pronunciation of the aspirates in Calcutta Bengali, but we only actually pronounce them when they come at the beginning of a word. Elsewhere we write them as aspirates and we think of them as aspirates but we pronounce them the same as their related non-aspirates. We write chele and we consciously pronounce the cha as an aspirate but when we write ma&#x301;ch we consciously pronounce the word as ma&#x301;c. Similarly, we consciously say karci for karchi and ja&#x301;cci for ja&#x301;cchi. Though we are aware of the pronunciation and knowingly pronounce the unaspirated letter in place of the aspirate, nevertheless it remains altogether undesirable to spell it with the unaspirated letter in such instances. Some writers spell it this way but by doing so they are introducing a disorder into the language which is harmful for students. Similarly, we pronounce ka&#x301;t&#x301; instead of ka&#x301;t&#x301;h, deki instead of dekhi, and kata&#x301; instead of katha&#x301;. If I say it that way, should I spell it that way also? Absolutely not!<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Generally speaking, in Rarhi Bengali and Shersha&#x301;hva&#x301;diya&#x301; Bengali (Malda &ndash; Murshidabad) the aspirates are fully pronounced throughout. Whenever a certain maternal uncle of mine from Calcutta saw me he would ask: Keman a&#x301;cis khoka&#x301;? [How are you, my boy?] I used to reply: Bha&#x301;la a&#x301;ci, ma&#x301;ma&#x301;ba&#x301;bu [I am fine, uncle.]. Another maternal uncle of mine from Berhampore used to ask me: Keman a&#x301;chis, khoka&#x301;? and I used to answer bha&#x301;la a&#x301;chi. When I would meet a certain cousin of mine he would ask: Keman a&#x301;shas? and I used to answer va&#x301;la ashi.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->As with the aspirated and unaspirated letters, the common people often mix up the pronunciation of antahstha letters and vargiiya letters, putting the antahstha letter first and the vargiiya after, especially if it is a two-syllable word that contains a&#x301;. For example, se la&#x301;ph diyeche [He has jumped]. Here la is an antahstha letter and pha is a vargiiya letter. From time to time uneducated people in certain areas reverse the letters while pronouncing the word and say hya&#x301;, ed&#x301;a&#x301; pha&#x301;l dishe. Similarly they exchange a preceding vargiiya letter with the following one because the latter vargiiya letters leave a strong impression on the tongue while pronouncing them. For example, instead of saying d&#x301;ekci we say decki. We call ba&#x301;ksa ba&#x301;ska. Riksha becomes riska&#x301;. In Magahii they say a&#x301;mdii hathii instead of a&#x301;dmii hathii. The word a&#x301;dmii is originally Semitic.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->The letter ka prepresents sam&#x301;vrttibodhicitta, that is, ka is a physical transplantation of psychic idea, thus it occupies the first position in the list of consonants. Ka is ka&#x301;ryyabrahma.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Anyhow I was speaking about case. The nominative case is a fully developed case. No sentence can exist without a subject while it can exist without an object. Thus, as far as case goes, the nominative comes first and the accusative follows it. For example, &ldquo;I am going&rdquo;. This sentence has the nominative but not the accusative. This can work with an intransitive verb.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->In olden times people used to form words based on sounds (sound-imitative words are formed in this way). Then, when different cases were made, they no longer used the original words. The life of people in those days was centred around their clans. Their oral language was very undeveloped. At most they learned to say a few words, thus their vocabulary was quite limited. Under pressure for survival the different clans used to fight with each other. In that backward age they used to call their own clan or group asmad and the other clan or group jusmad. Then gradually, while adjusting to the changes in language, the number of cases increased. After the nominative case came the accusative, instrumental, dative, ablative, genitive, locative and vocative cases. Slowly, along with the cases the case-endings also became separate. The first case-ending form of the nominative remained very close to the original root word. The second case-ending accusative became a little further removed, and the third even more so. In this way, moving further and further away, the vocative case finally returned to the first case-ending word form. The difference is that the vocative is not a genuine case because it is not directly connected with the verb. Of course it is certainly connected indirectly and in certain special cases directly. For example, bho ra&#x301;ma, ma&#x301;m uddhara or da&#x301;da&#x301; go, ekt&#x301;u egiye eso [O brother, come forward a bit]. However, whether the vocative case be direct or indirect, most of the time it remains connected with the imperative.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Now the question arises, how did this vocative case come into existence? In the old forested or sparsely populated areas there was often a need to call someone from far away. The vocative case was formed from this call. Say, for example, someone&#146;s name is Ratneshvar. If we try call them from far away by lengthening the closed syllable shvar in the name Ratneshvar it presents difficulties; thus the sound was shortened to an open syllable &ndash; Ratneshva&#x301;. Sha&#x301; is an open syllable. Of course, in Bengali many people do not want to accept the vocative case as a separate case.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->At any rate, the closely related nominative which came from the original word asmad was aham. Thereafter, according to number and case, subsequent words gradually became further removed from the original word or case. For example, the singular aham gradually became a&#x301;va&#x301;m in dvivacana [dual number] and vayam in the plural.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.15.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#15.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> Here a&#x301;va&#x301;m and vayam, which came from aham, are even further removed from the original word asmad. The accusatives &ndash; ma&#x301;m, ma&#x301;; a&#x301;va&#x301;m, nao; asman, nah &ndash; became even further removed. In this way a need was felt for the different cases and for this reason separate case-endings came into existence.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Now let us move on to the second case. It is said that if the accusative case is to be preserved then the second case-ending must be retained. Some languages have a separate form for the second case while in some languages its function is accomplished with the help of an indeclinable to indicate the second case, sometimes fully and sometimes partially. It should be pointed out that in Sanskrit there is a separate form for the second case. All languages have the accusative but not all languages have a separate form for the second case. Some languages have a different means for recognizing the accusative case. If the second case-ending is used for the accusative then it facilitates understanding of the language. For example, if I say Ra&#x301;m bha&#x301;tke kha&#x301;cche, [Ram is eating rice] then, due to the presence of sign indicating the second case [ke] attached to bha&#x301;t, there is no difficulty in understanding the meaning of the sentence, that Ram is eating the rice rather than the rice eating Ram. Of course, we can also understand who is eating whom from the meaning of the sentence. English does not have a separate case-ending for the accusative. The indeclinable &ldquo;to&rdquo; indicating the accusative accomplishes the task. However &ldquo;to&rdquo; is not always used with the accusative.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->The Sanskrit aham is nominative and the accusative is ma&#x301;m, not ahamam or asmadam. Ma&#x301;m is a second case-ending word. In Sanskrit there is no connection between aham and ma&#x301;m. The English word for aham is &ldquo;I&rdquo;. In English a&#x301;ma&#x301;ke is &ldquo;to me&rdquo;, not &ldquo;to I&rdquo;. As in Sanskrit, the word &ldquo;me&rdquo; is very far removed from the original word. It is also a separate form of the second case. There is no connection between &ldquo;I&rdquo; and &ldquo;me&rdquo;. &ldquo;Me&rdquo; is a new word. Had aham been the first case in Sanskrit and ahamam the second case, then there would have been a connection between the two words. However the second case became ma&#x301;m, a&#x301;va&#x301;m, asman. For this reason Sanskrit is a little difficult to learn. Bengali is easy by comparison.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->The Sanskrit language is bound by the dos and don&#146;ts of grammar; thus in order to learn the language one has to learn the rules of grammar as well. Bengali is much easier in that respect. In Bengali a&#x301;mi is used in the first case and a&#x301;ma&#x301;ke (that is, a&#x301;mi-ke) in the second. In Hindi and Urdu maen is used in the first case and although maenko would be straightforward and simple if it were used in the second, mujhko is used instead. Thus Hindi is relatively harder to learn than Bengali.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->The Sanskrit second case ma&#x301;m is ma&#x301; in the Vedic language. In Sanskrit a&#x301;va&#x301;m is used, in Vedic nao; in Sanskrit asman and in Vedic nah. The Sanskrit word ma&#x301; has three meanings: &ldquo;tongue&rdquo;, &ldquo;to me&rdquo; and &ldquo;no&rdquo; (negation). From this comes the Bengali word ma&#x301;na&#x301;. Ma&#x301;na&#x301; karechen means na&#x301;-na&#x301; karechen [they have prohibited]. In Hindi we say mana&#x301; kiye. The Hindi mana&#x301; is spelled without the long &ldquo;a&rdquo; [a&#x301;] but in fact it should be spelled with a&#x301;, that is, the word is not mana&#x301; but ma&#x301;na&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Earlier I said that the Vedic word ma&#x301; means &ldquo;to me&rdquo;. It bears no relation to the word asmad. The Vedic nao means &ldquo;to the two of us&rdquo;. Nah means &ldquo;to us&rdquo;. In Sanskrit the visarga equals s (with hasanta) equals r (with hasanata) equals h (with hasanta). That is, nah and nas are the same thing. The word nas is used in Russian. In French the word vous and nous are pronounced bhu and nu respectively. Of course in French the final &ldquo;s&rdquo; is silent.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->Anyhow, if we say jyotih in Sanskrit it can be pronounced in three ways &ndash; jyotis, jyotir and jyotih. According to the rules of Sanskrit, if a vowel follows a visarga then the visarga is dropped, however if it is followed by a consonant then it is not dropped. For example, if one says jyotihke ballum then it is spelled with the visarga but jyoti + indra becomes jyotirindra because it is a compound word.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->At any rate, although the second case-ending is found in Sanskrit or Vedic, in Bengali there is often no linguistic sign to indicate the second case. For example, Ra&#x301;m bha&#x301;t khacche [Ram is eating rice]. Of course in Rarhi Bengali they still say mui gharake jechi [I am going home] and in Oriya they say mu gharaku jibi.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->After this comes the third case. It is said that the third case is the instrumental case. The instrumental has been accepted as a separate case in all of the world&#146;s developed languages. In Sanskrit the instrumental case is the third case because it is directly linked to the verb in the active voice. It is indirectly linked in the passive and impersonal voices. Thus it has to be accepted, otherwise there will be no sentence. In Sanskrit the third case is fixed for the instrumental but in Bengali, Hindi and other Indian languages there is no fixed case for the instrumental, nor does it have any separate form. In Bengali the instrumental indeclinable dva&#x301;ra&#x301; is used after the sixth case-ending to form the third case. For example, a&#x301;ma&#x301;r dva&#x301;ra&#x301; ei ka&#x301;j habe na&#x301; [This work will not be done by me]; in Hindi mere dva&#x301;ra&#x301; is used, or even more idiomatically mujhse. For example, mujhse yah ka&#x301;m nahii ho pa&#x301;ega&#x301;. Here mujhse is the ablative form. It is an idiomatic expression of Hindi.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->The instrumental case exists in Bengali but there is no separate form for the third case. Furthermore, the instrumental is often formed by using an instrumental verb after the second case-ending. For example, A&#x301;ma&#x301;ke diye ei ka&#x301;j habe na&#x301;. The third case is formed in English in the same way by using an instrumental indeclinable. In English the prepositions &ldquo;by&rdquo; and &ldquo;with&rdquo; are used. The preposition &ldquo;by&rdquo; is used to show a direct link with the verb and the preposition &ldquo;with&rdquo; to show an indirect link. For example, &ldquo;The room has been cleaned by Sita with the help of a broom&rdquo;. Nowadays one sees confusion in the use of these two. Most likely it is not being taught properly in the schools and colleges. In some places it seems that the error persists.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->In Sanskrit in all such cases a suffix has been fixed for the original subject and for the secondary or minor subject. In the case of the principal subject, the suffix s&#x301;ak is affixed to the verbal root and for the secondary subject the suffix n&#x301;ak is added to the verbal root to form the adjective. For example, Dhopa&#x301; raung diye ka&#x301;par&#x301; chopa&#x301;cche [The washerman is staining the clothes with dye].<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.15.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#15.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> The Sanskrit for dhopa&#x301; [washerman] is rajaka or sabha&#x301;sundara, just as the Sanskrit for na&#x301;pit [barber] is para&#x301;ma&#x301;n&#x301;ika or narasundara. Dhopa&#x301; or rajaka is the principal subject, thus the suffix s&#x301;ak is added to the verbal root ranj to form the word rajaka, that is, &ldquo;one who dyes clothes&rdquo;. If the suffix n&#x301;ak is added to the verbal root ranj then it forms the word rain&#x32D;jaka, that is, &ldquo;an object with which something is dyed&rdquo; or &ldquo;the dye which has been bought from the market&rdquo;. Here there is a similarity between English and Sanskrit. Just as Sanskrit has different suffixes for the principal and the secondary subject, similarly in English there are separate prepositions for the same reason. Since English does not have a separate form for the third case as Sanskrit does, this is accomplished by the prepositions &ldquo;by&rdquo; and &ldquo;with&rdquo;. The third case form for the word asmad is maya&#x301;. This is very far removed from the first case form aham, so it is a new form. Thus just because one knows the original word in Sanskrit, it does not mean that one can know what the third case form will be. The third case form will have to be learned and remembered separately, especially in the case of pronouns. In French the situation is somewhat similar to Sanskrit.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->In Bengali and most Indian languages there is no separate form for the third case. However, needless to say, the instrumental case certainly exists. In Sanskrit the word karan&#x301;a [instrumental, cause] used to be used to indicate the idea that governmental laws were linked with action. Certainly this is the fundamental principle in the instrumental case. Thus in ancient India and during the Buddhist era as well, those who were closely connected to government paperwork were called karan&#x301;a. Karan&#x301;a means Ka&#x301;yashta (sadbaoddha-karan&#x301;a-ka&#x301;yattha-t&#x301;hakkura) [one of the principal castes].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->In Sanskrit the third case is not only instrumental. Adhvaka&#x301;la&#x301;bhya&#x301;m apavarge. That is, the third case is used for apavarga.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.15.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#15.fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> Manus&#x301; ra&#x301;sta&#x301;y cale &ndash; care na&#x301; [Man walks in the road, he doesn&#146;t graze]. The verb carati is used to mean &ldquo;move while eating&rdquo;, not calati. A person walks but a cow grazes. In Hindi ga&#x301;y cartii hae. In Bhojpuri ga&#x301;y caratiiya&#x301;. However, if a person eats while walking then in that case it is not unreasonable to use the word carche although it is not done. Some of us eat ca&#x301;na&#x301;cur or jha&#x301;lmur&#x301;i or peanuts when we are walking, do we not? However if someone says that we are grazing [carchi] then our self-respect will suffer a blow. How can we keep our self-respect like that!<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->In Sanskrit, if one holds to a specific path, moves along it, finishes the work and reaps its fruits as well, then the third case-ending is used to indicate this. It is the instrumental case. In Bengali the seventh case is used in this situation and the case will also be the locative case. For example, se pathe khete khete ja&#x301;cche o ek ghan&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301;y se khele [He is eating while going down the road and in one hour he ate it.]. Here pathe and ghan&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301;y are in the seventh case.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->In Sanskrit there are three kinds of locatives &ndash; ka&#x301;la&#x301;dhikaran&#x301;a, bha&#x301;va&#x301;dhikaran&#x301;a and a&#x301;dha&#x301;ra&#x301;dhikaran&#x301;a [the locatives of time, idea and base]. Many do not accept ka&#x301;la&#x301;dhikaran&#x301;a in Bengali but it must be accepted.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->In what we have been discussing till this point it has been shown, first of all, that in Sanskrit the third case means the instrumental but in Bengali and many Indian languages the third case does not have a separate form. Secondly, in English the instrumental indeclinables &ldquo;by&rdquo; and &ldquo;with&rdquo; are used for this purpose. However in this regard one must take into account the four English moods; in addition one will have to consider case and case-ending. The English synonym for ka&#x301;raka is &ldquo;case&rdquo; and the English synonym for ka&#x301;raka-vibhakti is &ldquo;case-ending&rdquo;. Mood shares the same properties as case. The indicative, imperative, subjunctive and infinitive moods are related to case. Take, for example, &ldquo;to walk is a good exercise&rdquo;. Here &ldquo;to walk&rdquo; is used as the nominative. There is no synonymous or equivalent word for mood in the Indian languages. Nor is there one in the Latin-derived languages.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->The next subject for discussion is the dative case. It is said that the dative case [samprada&#x301;na ka&#x301;raka] is the fourth case. Sam-pra-da&#x301;+anat&#x301; is the derivation of samprada&#x301;na. In ancient times when the sages used to offer sacrifices they used to keep a standing offering intended for the gods along with their worship. To offer something permanently in this way is called samprada&#x301;na. The dative case does not have any value as a case. Of course, in Sanskrit it has some value but not in any other modern language. At least in the two hundred or so languages I am talking about there is no such case as the dative case. Since there is no case there is also no separate case-ending or case indicator.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->In Sanskrit the dative case has its own form or case-ending. If I say dhopa&#x301;ke ka&#x301;par&#x301; dilum [I gave the washerman clothes] or bhikha&#x301;rike ka&#x301;par&#x301; dilum [I gave the beggar clothes] the difference between the two is that what I give to the washerman will be returned, that is, that giving is temporary, but what I give the beggar is permanent. For this reason the washerman will be in the second case in Sanskrit &ndash; rajakam &ndash; but the beggar will be in the fourth case &ndash; bhiks&#x301;uka&#x301;ya. In Sanskrit this change is a change from the accusative case to the dative case, but in Bengali there is no such difference or change. In Bengali if one says diye dilum or da&#x301;n karlum then it is understood that the giving is permanent so no need is felt there for the dative case.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->Hindi is quite similar to Bengali in this regard. In Hindi ko is used to indicate the accusative case and it is also used for the dative case. This is not only true of Hindi or Urdu and Bengali; there is no such thing as the dative case in any Indian language. Students have been burdened with an extra grammatical load for no good reason. Something completely needless, extraneous and superfluous has been maintained in the grammar. It has no separate existence nor any separate case-ending. In Sanskrit ra&#x301;ma&#x301;ya, nara&#x301;ya and so on are used to indicate the dative case. In Sanskrit mahyam is used as the fourth case dative for the word asmad; it bears no relation to the original word. In Hindi and Urdu mujhko or mujhe is used for the dative. Neither one is fourth case. Mujhko is the second case and mujhe is the seventh.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->In Sanskrit the fourth case is also used to mean &ldquo;for&rdquo;, for example, &ldquo;namaskar for Shiva&rdquo; &ndash; Shiva&#x301;ya namah. Here Shiva is put in the fourth case to mean &ldquo;for Shiva&rdquo;. The case indicator a&#x301;ya has been added. In Sanskrit the fourth case forms are une, bhya&#x301;m, bhyas, but in Bengali or any other Indian language there is no separate form for the fourth case. In Bengali the fourth case is formed by adding the indeclinables janya, nimitta, la&#x301;gi, lege, la&#x301;giya&#x301;, etc. Similarly in Angika lelii, la&#x301; are added, in Maethilii lel, in Magahii la&#x301;gi, in Bhojpuri la&#x301;, vade, la&#x301;gi, kha&#x301;tir, in Oriya pa&#x301;ni, and so on. In other words, all use an indeclinable denoting &ldquo;for&rdquo; along with the root word for the sixth case. For example, Toma&#x301; la&#x301;gi jege achi diva&#x301;nishi [I stay awake for you day and night]. In Sanskrit also the form used in the fourth case is very far removed from the original word. For example, asmad &ndash; mahyam.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->Clearly we can say that while the dative case deserves to be preserved in Sanskrit, there is no need for it in any other language. Kabir has said: Sam&#x301;skrta ku&#x301;podaka, bha&#x301;kha&#x301; vahata&#x301; niira. That is, the Sanskrit language is blocked like the water of a well but the mother tongue is like the flowing water of a river. Sanskrit is like a sitar with its frets fixed while the people&#146;s language is like a violin without fixed frets &ndash; if you can stop the strings, though, it sounds very melodious.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="15..35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->That which is mastered by continued arduous practice is called <I>dhrupada</I>. The Sanskrit language has been bound by the composition of grammar. For this reason, the Sanskrit language is called <I>dhrupadii</I> language.

The Vedic language does not have any grammar, thus in this sense Vedic is not a <I>dhrupadii</I> language.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..36"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph -->A certain type of music is also called <I>dhrupadii</I>. Some people mistakenly think that <I>dhrupadii</I> music refers perhaps to a special <I>ra&#x301;ga</I> or <I>ra&#x301;gin&#x301;ii</I> or a composition in that raga, but this is not the case. <I>Dhrupada</I> is a certain type of method or style where the music is fixed in a certain scale. This method or style differed from place to place. For example, in Agra, Jaonpur, Lucknow, Gwalior, Varanasi, Betiah, Vishnupur, and so on, each music found expression in its own style. And from each of these distinctive styles arose a separate <I>ghara&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;</I> [a particular style or school]. But it is necessary to mention that all of these <I>ghara&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;s</I>, their rendering styles being rigidly confined to only certain specific notes corresponding to a particular <I>ra&#x301;ga</I> or <I>ragin&#x301;ii</I>, gradually came to the point of dying out. Their condition became like that of women wearing the veil. The music became thirsty and anxious for the slightest respite, to breathe a little fresh air [<I>ha&#x301;oya&#x301;</I>]. Incidentally, the word <I>ha&#x301;va&#x301;</I> is a Turkish word. In order to reform the Turkish alphabet and spelling, Kemal Pasha (Kemal Atat&uuml;rk) introduced Roman script. Similarly, in order to reform the rule-bound style of music and in the hopes of breathing a little fresh air, there was an effort in the Mughal court to breathe some life into <I>dhrupadii</I> music. In this case, although the correct scale was maintained, freedom was given to the vocalist to go here and there. This facility or opportunity was thus the music&#146;s <I>kheya&#x301;l</I>. This <I>kheya&#x301;l</I> of <I>dhrupadii</I> saved the music from monotony. <I>Dhrupadii</I> music was cultivated in the Vishnupurii <I>ghara&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;</I> of Bengal but it did not create its own <I>kheya&#x301;l</I>. Bengali music hardly ever used to be sung in <I>dhrupadii</I> style, hence in that respect Bengali music was already somewhat free from this kind of monotony. It was for this reason, of course, that the need for <I>kheya&#x301;l</I> was not felt in Bengali music.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..37"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=37 type=paragraph -->When <I>sam&#x301;giita</I> (the combined name for instrumental music, vocal music and dance) is not bound fast by the scale, that is, when the singer enjoys sufficient freedom in their vocals, when the dancers can direct their steps to some extent according to their own wishes, when the musicians enjoy a certain freedom with the metre while playing, then this kind of <I>sam&#x301;giita</I>, that is, dance, vocal and instrumental music, can be called folk song, folk music and folk dance. However this does not mean that this folk music will always remain classified as folk music. When it becomes bound by certain rules, it will also rise to the level of <I>dhrupadii</I>, as has happened with Manipurii dance. This rising to the level of <I>dhrupadii</I> has two sides to it. On the one hand, when folk music rises to the level of <I>dhrupadii</I>, it gains a certain respect, a certain prestige. On the other hand, this respect and prestige prevent it from moving ahead on its path. The flowing river full of vitality gets transformed into a swamp choked with water hyacinths &ndash; the sun of its fortune sinks forever into the mud and mire.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="16..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The spoken Bengali of Midnapore is quite an old form of Bengali. Midnapore&#146;s place in the cultural life of Bengal is also quite important. The people of Midnapore have never lost their vitality of life, even when passing their days enduring countless insults. Indeed, in the pre-Pathan era, the Pathan and Mughal eras, and even in the beginning of British rule, which was witness to the Chuyar Rebellion [cuya&#x301;r&#x301; vidroha], we have seen great agitation for freedom there; later, in 1942, there was an earth-shaking, stirring agitation. I can see today that many of you have come here from Midnapore. The spoken language of the western part of Midnapore, which means Jhar&#x301;gra&#x301;m subdivision, is a dialect of central Rarhi Bengali. This same dialect is prevalent in Mayurbhainj and Singhbhum. The spoken language of the southern coastal areas of Midnapore, from the mouth of the Rasulpur River to the mouth of the Suvarnarekha River, I have named Contai Bengali. The full pronunciation of the consonants is present in great measure in this dialect. Based on the evidence, it is easy to arrive at the conclusion that the poet Kalidasa was from this area.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Anyhow, the northern part of our well-known land of Rarh, which we generally call north Rarh, was known in olden times as Varddhama&#x301;n Bhukti. Roughly speaking, north Rarh consisted of modern-day Birbhum, Dumka, Dhanbad, western Murshidabad, Burdwan and Hooghly. Southern Rarh, or Dan&#x301;d&#x301;a Bhukti, consisted of certain parts of Hooghly, certain parts of Burdwan, Howrah, Midnapore, Bankura, Purulia, Singhbhum, Baleshwar and certain parts of Mayurbhainj District. This Dan&#x301;d&#x301;a Bhukti was invaded several times during the reign of the Kesharii kings of Orissa (Anantakesharii, Yayatikesharii). During the Maratha invasions, when part of Orissa&#146;s revenue had to be given to the Marathas, the then nawab, Alivarddi Khan, placed certain parts of Midnapore, along with 24 Paraganas, Chittagong and Burdwan, partially in the hands of the British. Dan&#x301;d&#x301;a Bhukti was known as Hijlii during the Pathan and the beginning of the Mughal eras. When what we call ka&#x301;juba&#x301;da&#x301;m [cashew nut] was brought to this country by the Portuguese, it was first cultivated in Hijlii. Thus the actual Bengali name for cashew nut is hijlii ba&#x301;da&#x301;m. This nut was also cultivated extensively in Kerala. When the farmers of that region wanted cash value in exchange for their nuts they used to pronounce it as &ldquo;cashu&rdquo;. Consequently the name hijlii ba&#x301;da&#x301;m later became &ldquo;cashew nut&rdquo;. A certain ga&#x301;jii from a region in Turkey by the name of Soharward arrived in Hijlii to preach his religion.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.16.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#16.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> He wanted to convert Hijlii into an ideological centre for his religion, thus he gave it the name Madina&#x301;pur. When Nawab Alivarddi Khan turned over this Madina&#x301;pur to the British they christened it &ldquo;Midnapore&rdquo;. Rather than using either name, Midnapore or Madina&#x301;pur, the local people call it Mediniipur. Near the end of British rule Bengal&#146;s first minister (at that time he was not called chief minister) was Mr. H. S. Soharwardi, a descendant of the ga&#x301;jii who came from Soharward. This Midnapore is an ideological centre for various reasons.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The next subject of discussion is the ablative case [apa&#x301;da&#x301;na ka&#x301;raka]. The word apa&#x301;da&#x301;na s derived apa &ndash; a&#x301; &ndash; da&#x301; + anat&#x301;. It means &ldquo;to take something from something else&rdquo;. In Bengali the indeclinables hate [from], theke, t&#x301;heine (t&#x301;ha&#x301;ni-e), and so on, are used for this. Similarly in Hindi the indeclinable se is used, in Oriya ru, etc.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->It is said that the ablative is the fifth case. The root word of the word pain&#x32D;camii [fifth] is panc. It is a Vedic word which means &ldquo;hand-work&rdquo;. Whatever may be the work done by the hand &ndash; whether patting someone on the back or making rice-cakes &ndash; it all comes within the scope of panc. In later times the word shilpana came to be used in Sanskrit for work done by hand. Thus one who did work by hand, or shilpana kriya&#x301;, is a shilpii. Nowadays the word shilpii is used all over. For example, one who sings is called kan&#x301;t&#x301;hashilpii [vocal artist]. Now we can call someone skilled in handiwork a shilpii, for example, vayanashilpii [knitter], tantushilpii [weaver], and so on. But how is it that one who is skilled in vocal work can be called shilpii? On the one hand, the word yantrashilpii [instrumentalist] can be used. The word shilpii can work for someone who plays a sitar. But the word kan&#x301;t&#x301;hashilpii is not correct. The word kan&#x301;t&#x301;hashilpii is an oxymoron like &ldquo;gold stone-dish&rdquo;. A dish can be gold or a dish can be stone but it cannot be both. Similarly, one who sings is a ga&#x301;yaka [singer], not a shilpii. Those who sing are called ga&#x301;yaka if they are male and ga&#x301;yakii if they are female. Many people call lady singers ga&#x301;yika&#x301; but this is incorrect; the proper word is ga&#x301;yakii because gae + n&#x301;aka = ga&#x301;yaka. By adding the feminine suffix uniip we get ga&#x301;yakii. I would like to add here that as with ga&#x301;yika&#x301;, the word sevika&#x301; is incorrect. Nevertheless the feminine form sevika&#x301; of the word sevaka is extremely common. Its correct form is sevaka&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Now the question is: why is in&#x32D;a used to spell pain&#x32D;ca instead of na or m&#x301;? The rule for both Sanskrit and Vedic is that if the original word or original verbal root is spelled with the apada&#x301;nta na or ma then the corresponding word takes the fifth letter of that varga. For example, the original verbal root panc is pronounced with apada&#x301;nta na and since ca is added to it then it is spelt with the fifth letter of the ca varga, or in&#x32D;a. The word saun&#x32D;ga comes from the verbal root sanj in accordance with the very same rule. Here the na is not pada&#x301;nta, it is not at the end of the word. Since the ja is replaced by ga then the concerned varga&#146;s fifth letter is used, that is, un&#x32D;a instead of na. For this reason it is spelled un&#x32D;ga. Similarly the word rain&#x32D;jana comes from the verbal root ran&#x301;j. The n&#x301;a in ran&#x301;j is apada&#x301;nta, so instead of n&#x301;a or m&#x301; the fifth letter ina is used. Similarly, gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301; is spelled with unga. The word gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301; is derived gam + gam + d&#x301;a + feminine a&#x301;. Gam means &ldquo;towards ga&rdquo; and ga here means &ldquo;an extensive land&rdquo;. Gam + d&#x301;a + feminine a&#x301; = ga&#x301;, that is, &ldquo;a woman who so goes&rdquo;. Gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301; means &ldquo;that river which flows through an extensive land&rdquo; &ndash; from Gangotri towards Gangasagar. Gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301; is spelled with pada&#x301;nta ma, thus should it not have an anusva&#x301;r? No, it does not because even though the m (with hasanta) of the first gam is pada&#x301;nta, it is not by itself a word or a verbal root. It is the singular second case of the word ga. After the second gam is joined to the first the ma is dropped so it does not come under consideration. Hence gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301; is definitely spelled with the fifth letter of the ga varga, that is, unga. However in the spelling of sampa&#x301;dak, shaun&#x32D;kar, and so on, either the fifth letter ma, or una, or the anusva&#x301;ra can be used, that is, either sampa&#x301;dak or sam&#x301;pa&#x301;dak, shaun&#x32D;kar or sham&#x301;kar. Nowadays we see a tendency to spell gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301; with the anusva&#x301;ra instead of una, but this is incorrect. In some languages they go so far as to spell the word vasanta as vasam&#x301;ta.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->As I was saying, the original Vedic word panc means &ldquo;work done by hand&rdquo;.

That which is formed out of five a&#x301;b, or five streams of water, is pain&#x32D;ja&#x301;b. An impress of five fingers is called pain&#x32D;ja&#x301; in Farsi.

<a name="16..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->The rule that the ablative case is the fifth case is followed closely in Sanskrit. The ablative case uses the fifth case-ending to indicate that something is taken from a specific source. For example, nara&#x301;t [from man], Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;t [from Rama], and so on.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->In Sanskrit the fifth case has its own separate form but this is not true in Bengali or in any other Indian language. In most cases the fifth case is formed by adding ablative-indicating indeclinables, such as theke, ceye, hate, etc. after the sixth case-ending, for example, Ra&#x301;mer theke [from Ram]. In Hindi the indeclinable se is added to form the fifth case, for example, Ramse. In such an instance there is no need for the sixth case-ending. In English the preposition &ldquo;from&rdquo; is used for this purpose. In old English &ldquo;unto&rdquo; was also used. In the old English of twelve hundred years ago &ldquo;unto&rdquo; had three common uses corresponding to &ldquo;towards&rdquo;, &ldquo;to&rdquo;, and &ldquo;from&rdquo;. In modern English &ldquo;unto&rdquo; is practically not used at all, however in the Bible it is used to mean &ldquo;to&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->In old Bengali, from fifteen hundred years ago to about six hundred years ago, the word hante was used, meaning hate [from]. The word hante appears in the Sris&#x301;t&#x301;irahasya, written by Saeyad Mohamad Alawal, the court poet of the king of Arakan. The language of the people of Arakan was Magii, a Burmese language. Bear in mind here that all languages in Burma are Burmese languages. For example, Arakanii or Magii, Chin, Kachin, Tenaserim, Burman and so on. However the principal language is Burman. It is also the language of the central government. Although Magii is a Burmese language, it is not Burman. All of these Burmese languages are written in more or less the same script. Of course there is a slight difference between some of the letters. The Burmese alphabet is Indo-Aryan, that is, it is formed with the Indian letters &ndash; a, a&#x301;, ka, kha, etc.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->The script of Thailand&#146;s Thai language and of the Tibetan language belong to the same family. Although the people of these lands belong to the Mongolian race, unlike the Chinese their scripts are not pictorial, but rather Indo-Aryan. The royal language or government language of Arakan was Bengali. The word hante was common in the Bengali of that time. Saeyad Alawal has written:<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="16..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->The modern Bengali word haite or hate comes from the word hante. The ablative-indicating indeclinable theke comes from the old Burmese word ta&#x301;ikiya&#x301;. The Burmese word ta&#x301;ikiya&#x301; became ta&#x301;ikya&#x301; in the southern Chittagong dialect and from this comes the modern Bengali tha&#x301;kiya&#x301; or theke. The mixed dialect that was formed from an admixture of Magii and southern Chittagong&#146;s Coxbazaar dialect is known colloquially as Zarvadi Bengali. The word ta&#x301;ikiya&#x301; no longer exists in modern Magii or Burmese but theke is used extensively in modern Bengali.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->All languages have an ablative case. In Bengali and most of the Indian languages the fifth case is created by first putting the original word in the sixth case and then adding the corresponding ablative-indicating indeclinable. For example, from maen [I] comes mujhse [from me]. Urdu follows the same rule. In Hindi and Urdu se functions in both the third and fifth cases. &ldquo;With&rdquo; does not fall into any specific case. Even though in Sanskrit &ldquo;with&rdquo; indicates the third case and makes it instrumental (as in saha-yoge trtiiya&#x301; [adding &ldquo;with&rdquo; makes it third case]), saha-yoge trtiiya&#x301; does not hold true in Bengali. Adding &ldquo;with&rdquo; makes it the sixth case and genitive as well &ndash; in Sanskrit, maya&#x301; saha [with me], Ra&#x301;men&#x301;a saha [with Ram], but in Bengali a&#x301;ma&#x301;r saunge, Ra&#x301;mer saunge.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Nowadays in modern Bengali many people use the word sa&#x301;the interchangeably with saunge, however the word sa&#x301;the is not native Bengali; it comes from Hindi and Gorkhali. In pure Bengali and pure Maethilii the use of saunge is more proper. In our Calcutta Bengali we do not say sathe; we say saunge.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Even though there is great grammatical similarity between Hindi and Urdu there are some differences as well, for example, gender. There used to be more difference between Hindi and Urdu in the feminine plural, however nowadays that has lessened somewhat. For example, in Hindi lar&#x301;kiya&#x301;n ja&#x301; rahiin thiin. Formerly in Urdu one used to write lar&#x301;kiya&#x301;n ja rahiin thiin. Of course, in the beginning people used to write it this way in Hindi as well. According to the normal rule, foreign words are feminine in Hindi. However this rule is not followed very strictly because there are many exceptions (what we call in Hindi apava&#x301;d). For example, the word kalam [pen] is foreign (Farsi). Kalam is feminine in Hindi. It is not only because it is foreign. The Sanskrit synonym for kalam is lekhanii which is also feminine. Hence kalam is feminine in Hindi, that is, we say merii kalam [my pen]. Since kalam is a foreign word it should also be feminine in Urdu but it is not. It is masculine in Urdu, that is, one says mera&#x301; kalam. If we use the word kalam in Hindi in masculine form then it does not mean a writing pen; it means &ldquo;grafted plant&rdquo;, as in &ldquo;mango graft&rdquo;, &ldquo;blackberry graft&rdquo;, and so on.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->The Farsi word duka&#x301;n changes gender when the spelling changes. If it is spelled with u &ndash; duka&#x301;n &ndash; then it is feminine, for example, merii duka&#x301;n. But if we spell it with u&#x301; &ndash; du&#x301;ka&#x301;n &ndash; then it becomes masculine, that is, mera&#x301; du&#x301;ka&#x301;n.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Different rules also exist side by side in Hindi for some half-Sanskrit words, for example, ca&#x301;lcalan. Some people use it in masculine gender and others in feminine. The Urdu synonym for a&#x301;tma&#x301; [soul] is ru&#x301;h. Ru&#x301;h is feminine so in Hindi many people use a&#x301;tma&#x301; in feminine gender. However the word a&#x301;tma&#x301; is not feminine in Sanskrit, so in order to maintain concordance with Sanskrit some people use it in masculine gender. I support the second opinion so in my Hindi writings I have generally used the word a&#x301;tma&#x301; as masculine.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->In Hindi number and gender affect the verb. In English number affects the verb but gender does not, for example, &ldquo;he goes&rdquo;, but &ldquo;they go&rdquo;. In this case number affects the verb according to the general rule. But if I say &ldquo;Ram is going and Sita is going&rdquo; then one can see that gender does not affect the verb while number does.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->The languages of Bihar also have an ablative case but they do not have a separate form for the fifth case-ending. As in Bengali the fifth case is constructed in these languages by adding an indeclinable, se, after the sixth case form. Incidentally, it should be mentioned that the pronunciation of se is somewhere between se and sa. For example, the Hindi for &ldquo;from me&rdquo; is mujhse. In Angika it is hamra&#x301;san. In Oriya ru is added to make the fifth case, for example, vrks&#x301;aru (in Oriya the pronunciation is vruks&#x301;aru).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Anyhow, all languages have the ablative case but no Indian language apart from Sanskrit has a separate form for the fifth case-ending. There was no Vedic grammar. Early on there was no Vedic dictionary; only towards the end of the Vedic era did it come into existence. The famous composer of the Vedic dictionary, Yaska, lived long after the end of Rgvedic age. Since there was no Vedic grammar the question of what was correct and what was incorrect did not arise. Often errors were accepted because they were common usage among the Aryans. For example, during the Rgvedic age the word shiks&#x301;a was pronounced as if it had a long ii, that is, if it was written it would have been written shiiks&#x301;a. Similarly, the verbal root ji was used in a&#x301;tmanepadii, for example, jayate, jayete, jayante (that is, te, a&#x301;te, ante). However in Sanskrit the verbal root ji is parasmaepadii, in other words, jayati, jayatah, jayanti (or ti, tas, anti). Generally in Sanskrit if a prefix is added before a parasmaepadii verbal root then it becomes a&#x301;tmanedpadii, for example, vijayate. Later on Panini faced a lot of difficulties because of this, so he made a compromise between the two and gave it the name ubhayapadii [ubhaya means &ldquo;both&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->Verbs are not used in a&#x301;tmanepadii form at all in Laokika Sanskrit. By accepting them as ubhayapadii he was able to maintain concordance [bojha&#x301;par&#x301;a&#x301;] with the Vedic language.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.16.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#16.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> Another example is the verbal root cal [to move]. In Laokika Sanskrit this verbal root is 99.99 percent parasmaepadii but Panini accepted it as ubhayapadii. Apart from one saying of the Buddha, one will not come across any other example of the verbal root cal being used as a&#x301;tmanepadii. That saying of the Buddha is:<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="16..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->At any rate, whether or not the ablative case has a separate form, it exists in all languages. In Bengali hate, theke, haite, t&#x301;heine, and so on, are used for this purpose. Some people might be a little surprised to hear the word t&#x301;heine but there is no cause for wonder because all languages have distinctive [a&#x301;la&#x301;da&#x301;] specialities of pronunciation and meaning. For example, the English word &ldquo;double&rdquo; also means &ldquo;double&rdquo; in Bengali, but in Angika it means &ldquo;very big&rdquo;. It is worth pointing out here that the word a&#x301;la&#x301;da&#x301; comes from a Farsi word, ala&#x301;hida&#x301;. Nowadays this word a&#x301;la&#x301;da&#x301; can no longer be separated [a&#x301;la&#x301;da&#x301; kara&#x301;] from the Bengali language.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->I was saying before that the word kalam is feminine in Hindi and masculine in Urdu. The feminine gender is used in Hindi to refer to weapons but barcha&#x301; [spear], pharsa&#x301; [axe], bha&#x301;la&#x301; [lance], etc. are masculine in Hindi although they denote specific weapons. The word talva&#x301;r is feminine in Hindi but masculine in Urdu.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->The next subject of discussion is the genitive case. The genitive is the sixth [s&#x301;as&#x301;t&#x301;hii] case. The word s&#x301;as&#x301;t&#x301;hii begins with the letter s&#x301;a. The Yajurvedic pronunciation of s&#x301;a is kha, so the Yajurvedic pronunciation of s&#x301;as&#x301;t&#x301;hii is khas&#x301;t&#x301;hii. However if it is in the beginning of a compound letter then it is not pronounced kha. In Bihar the word s&#x301;ad&#x301;ayantra is pronounced khar&#x301;yantra following the Yajurvedic pronunciation. In the same way santos&#x301;a is pronounced santokha in Panjabi and shis&#x301;ya is pronounced shikh.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->Anyway, the sixth case is used to relate one with another. In Bengali the indicator for the sixth case is r or er. For example, kalika&#x301;ta&#x301;r, Ra&#x301;mer. If the last letter ends with the pronunciation of a consonant then er is added, for example, varddhama&#x301;n-er &rarr; varddhama&#x301;ner. Although varddhama&#x301;n is not spelled with a hasanta it is pronounced as if it had one. Hence it is varddhama&#x301;ner, but cuncr&#x301;or.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->Just as r and er are added to form the sixth case, e, te, and ete are added to form the seventh case. E is added in all cases except for those words ending in i, ii, u or u&#x301;. Ete is added after those words whose pronunciation ends with an hasanta, whether or not they are spelled that way, and te added in the remaining cases. For example, Krs&#x301;nanagar-e, Varddhama&#x301;n-ete, Kalika&#x301;ta&#x301;-te.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->This kind of rule does not exist in Sanskrit. The sixth case-ending form differs according to the word. For example, the singular sixth case form of the word nara is narasya, but the sixth case singular for muni is muneh. For such reasons it is difficult to learn the word forms in Sanskrit. In English &ldquo;of&rdquo; and apostrophe &ldquo;s&rdquo; are used to make the sixth case. The pronunciation of &ldquo;of&rdquo; in English is like &ldquo;ov&rdquo;. Many mistakenly pronounce it like &ldquo;off&rdquo; but this is incorrect. &ldquo;Off&rdquo; means &ldquo;far&rdquo; and is spelt with double &ldquo;f&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->Hindi uses different indicators for the sixth case according to number and gender, namely ka&#x301;, kii, ke. Ka&#x301; is used for the masculine, kii for the feminine and ke for the masculine plural, for example, Ra&#x301;m ka&#x301; bha&#x301;i [Ram&#146;s brother], Ra&#x301;m kii bahan [Ram&#146;s sister], and so on. In Marwari ra&#x301;, ri and re are used; in Panjabi da, dii, and de; in Angika ra and ker; in Maethilii ak and ke; in Bhojpuri ke and ka; in Oriya ra and am&#x301;k; in Assamese ra; and so on. In French the definite article (the) changes according to the gender &ndash; le for the masculine, la for the feminine and les for the plural. This change in the definite article does not take place in English, nor in Hindi. Nor is there any change according to gender in the numerical article in either English or Hindi and Urdu. In other words, both masculine and feminine use ek [one]; the feminine does not use ekii. In English &ldquo;a&rdquo; or &ldquo;one&rdquo; remains unchanged but in French the numerical article also changes according to gender. The masculine form is un and the feminine is une. In this respect English is a bit more difficult than Bengali, Sanskrit even more difficult, Hindi more difficult still and French quite difficult.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->Many people do not accept the genitive case as a true case, but this is a matter that deserves careful consideration. As regards the genitive case, in Bengali the sixth case does not maintain a direct link with the verb, but often it maintains an indirect link due to the influence it exerts over the verb. For example, Ra&#x301;mer bha&#x301;i kha&#x301;cche [Ram&#146;s brother is eating]. Here there is no direct relationship between the verb kha&#x301;cche and Ra&#x301;m, but since the one who is eating is related to Ram therefore Ram maintains an indirect relationship with the verb, especially if Ram&#146;s brother does any true or untrue work of some magnitude. For example, Ra&#x301;mer bha&#x301;i ek laks&#x301;a&#x301;dhik t&#x301;a&#x301;ka&#x301; da&#x301;n kareche [Ram&#146;s brother has donated over one hundred thousand rupees]. The brother is giving &ndash; this is the root expression and it is nominative. However by saying &ldquo;Ram&#146;s brother&rdquo;, the word &ldquo;brother&rdquo; is indirectly modified, and when people hear it they will say: &ldquo;O, Ram&#146;s brother! He would be the one to make the donation. He takes after his brother.&rdquo; But if we say that Ram&#146;s brother is drinking too much wine these days, then people will say: &ldquo;Fie, fie! He&#146;s Ram&#146;s brother and he&#146;s drinking! What a disgrace!&rdquo; Thus the genitive indeed does indirectly influence the verb.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Ram&#146;s brother is eating.&rdquo; Here &ldquo;brother&rdquo; is a noun and &ldquo;Ram&rdquo; qualifies this noun. Now that which qualifies a noun or a pronoun is an &ldquo;adjective&rdquo;. The verb cannot be qualified because a verb is not a qualitative entity, so in the case of the verb a modifier is used instead of a qualifier. That which modifies a verb is called an &ldquo;adverb&rdquo;. The adverb is linked to the verb, so the adverb is said to belong to the same family as the genitive. Hence if the adverb is accepted in the genitive sense then the genitive case must also be accepted. If brinjal [begun] dipped in gram flour and fried is begunii then will pat&#x301;ol dipped in gram flour and fried be pat&#x301;ol fried meat instead of pat&#x301;olii? Since the adverb modifies the verb it has to be accepted as genitive case. &ldquo;The pandit&#146;s boy drinks wine.&rdquo; Nowadays many boys all over the world drink so there is nothing about this that is much cause for surprise. But the moment we hear that the pandit&#146;s boy drinks, our surprise increases, is it not? In other words, even though the genitive case &ldquo;pandit&rdquo; is not directly connected to the verb, it cannot be denied that it influences the verb significantly. So therefore how can the need for the genitive be denied?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->I mentioned earlier that Sanskrit has a separate form for the sixth case. However the sixth case form differs for different words and it can be very far removed from the original word. For example the sixth case form for the word asmad is mama or me, for a&#x301;vayoh it is nao, and for asma&#x301;kam it is nah. In the case of Hindi pronouns ham becomes hama&#x301;ra&#x301;, hama&#x301;re, hama&#x301;rii; tum becomes tumha&#x301;ra&#x301;, tumha&#x301;re, tumha&#x301;rii; and so on, differing according to number and gender. In Bengali a&#x301;mi becomes a&#x301;ma&#x301;r and tumi becomes toma&#x301;r. In English, although &ldquo;of&rdquo; and &ldquo; &#146;s&rdquo; are used for the genitive case, there are fixed forms for the pronouns: &ldquo;my&rdquo; from &ldquo;I&rdquo;, &ldquo;your&rdquo; from &ldquo;you&rdquo;, &ldquo;thy&rdquo; from &ldquo;thou&rdquo;, and so on. If the genitive pronoun follows &ldquo;of&rdquo; then altered forms are used, that is, &ldquo;my&rdquo; becomes &ldquo;mine&rdquo;, &ldquo;thy&rdquo; becomes &ldquo;thine&rdquo;, &ldquo;your&rdquo; becomes &ldquo;yours&rdquo;, &ldquo;her&rdquo; becomes &ldquo;hers&rdquo; and &ldquo;his&rdquo; becomes &ldquo;hiss&rdquo; in old English &ndash; in modern English it is written with one &ldquo;s&rdquo;. In French &ldquo;my&rdquo; is mon, ma or mes depending on number and gender. A moi, a toi, etc. are used when the voice changes.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->In Bengali and other modern Indian languages this kind of usage does not exist. In Sanskrit it exists to some extent but not so much, nor is there any need for it. In Sanskrit when there is an effort to speak circuitously or indirectly then generally this is done by making use of the sixth case, for example, ma&#x301;turna vyathate manah. In Bengali the sixth case is employed for this kind of expression, however there is less of this practice of indirect speech in Bengali. An example of indirect speech is:<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="17..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The subject of today&#146;s discussion is the locative [adhikaran&#x301;a] case. Adhikaran&#x301;a is derived by adding the prefix adhi and the suffix anat&#x301; to the verbal root kr. In Sanskrit the suffix abhi means &ldquo;great&rdquo; and the suffix adhi means &ldquo;extensive&rdquo; or &ldquo;collective&rdquo;. The word adhikaran&#x301;a means &ldquo;that extensive land or field which gives rise to a completed action [karan&#x301;a]&rdquo;. This extensive land or field is dependent upon time, place and person. In order for anything to be established, it has to be established on the basis of place or land, idea or time. For this reason the grammarian Panini accepted three bases of things &ndash; time, idea and base. The three types of locatives were created on the basis of these three &ndash; the locative of time, the locative of idea and the locative of base.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Nowadays the locative of idea does not enjoy widespread acceptance, however it cannot in any way be negated. If we say sa&#x301;hitye nipun&#x301;a [skilled in literature] then since sa&#x301;hitya [literature] is an idea, it is classified as the locative of idea. In the word sa&#x301;hitye, e is the indicator of the seventh case. When the inflection mayat&#x301; is added to the root word gun&#x301;a it becomes gun&#x301;amaya. Gun&#x301;amaya means &ldquo;one who is filled with qualities&rdquo;. Gun&#x301;a [quality] is a base. The meaning of the word deshagata is &ldquo;that thing or person which is within a country&rdquo;. Desh [country] is a base, thus these belong to the locative of base. If we say sandhya&#x301;bela&#x301;y [evening] then it refers to a particular time or a measure of time, a division of time, so it is the locative of time. Thus time, place, idea &ndash; all three can serve as a base. So these three have to be accepted as the locative case, that is, the locative of time, the locative of idea and the locative of base.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->It is said that the locative is the seventh case. This hard and fast rule is followed in Sanskrit, however there are distinctive case-endings in Sanskrit that differ from word to word. In Bengali there are three endings used for the seventh case &ndash; e, te and ete. If a Bengali word ends in i, ii, u or u&#x301; then e is not added. In all other cases e is the ending. For example, Kalika&#x301;ta&#x301;-e (Kalika&#x301;ta&#x301;y), Pat&#x301;na&#x301;-e (Pat&#x301;na&#x301;y), but instead of Kashii-e or Pa&#x301;la&#x301;mu-e it is Ka&#x301;shiite and Pa&#x301;la&#x301;mute. If a word ends with hasanta pronunciation (whether it is spelled that way or not) then ete can be added instead of e. For example, Varddhama&#x301;ne or Varddhama&#x301;nete, Krs&#x301;na&#x301;nagare or Krs&#x301;n&#x301;anagarete, and so on. Cuncr&#x301;o, however, is not spelled with ete because there is no hasanta pronunciation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->In Hindi me is used to indicate the locative case except in the case of pronouns. In the case of the pronouns tu [you - affectionate form] and maen [I] first jha is added and then e or me &ndash; tujhe, tujhme, mujhe, mujhme.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->In Oriya re is added for the seventh case. Of course sometimes te is used in poetry; in such instances the seventh case replaces the first. In Bengali, for example, there is the saying pa&#x301;gale ki na&#x301; bale, cha&#x301;gale ki na&#x301; kha&#x301;y [what won&#146;t a fool say, what won&#146;t a goat eat!]. In Assamese at is used, for example gharat. In old Bengali te and ete were used more than e. For example, deshete a&#x301;ila Ra&#x301;m a&#x301;nanda sava&#x301;r. However it should be pointed out that the language of poetry and the language of prose are not the same; poetry enjoys more leeway.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->In Maethilii ma or ma&#x301;n are used for the seventh case, however in poetry moy [in me] and toy [in you] were used and continue to be. In one composition of the ancient poet Vidyapati this line appears: daya&#x301; janu chor&#x301;avi moy. More used to be used in Hindi poetry for the seventh case, however since this is a matter of poetry the grammar should not be based on it. Often doggerels do not follow properly the rules of grammar. In dialects as well it is often seen that the rules of grammar are not obeyed. In all such cases not only is the seventh used to replace the first and second cases, but in addition they go outside the fundamental grammatical structure. For example, in Burdwan District there is a lullaby which goes like this:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..7"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->A&#x301;o re a&#x301;o re ba&#x301;cha&#x301; a&#x301;o<br>Kii la&#x301;gi ka&#x301;nda re ba&#x301;cha&#x301; kii dhan ca&#x301;o<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..8"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->[Come child, come/why are you crying? What treasure would you like?]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Nowadays the people of Burdwan District do not say a&#x301;o; they say a&#x301;y or a&#x301;i. For example, in Oriya if we say &ndash; amar&#x301;a (la) dhavar&#x301;a (la) pa&#x301;r&#x301;e (la) la&#x301;guchi manda madhura ha&#x301;oya&#x301;/Mote kabhu na&#x301; dekhilun kabhu na&#x301; sunilun emati taran&#x301;ii vaoya&#x301; &ndash; then according to grammar these two lines are incorrect, but as far as usage goes they are not incorrect. Another example is: Mastakare dei ha&#x301;t ka&#x301;nducchanti ra&#x301;ja&#x301;m&#x301;ka ma&#x301;ta&#x301;re/Ker&#x301;hen (n&#x301;a) gelun mor putra mo dhana re? From the standpoint of proper Oriya grammar mo dhana re should be mor dhana re but in poetry mo dhana re can be used. Anyhow, all languages need the three locatives &ndash; the locative of time, the locative of idea and the locative of base.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->English uses the locative indicators &ldquo;in&rdquo;, &ldquo;into&rdquo;, &ldquo;on&rdquo;, &ldquo;upon&rdquo;, &ldquo;unto&rdquo;, &ldquo;above&rdquo;, and &ldquo;within&rdquo;. The preposition &ldquo;in&rdquo; is used when something is inside of something else, for example, &ldquo;He is in the room.&rdquo; If someone is outside and then comes inside then the preposition &ldquo;into&rdquo; is used, for example, &ldquo;He went into the room&rdquo;. It is most unfortunate that many people nowadays do not observe this distinction between &ldquo;in&rdquo; and &ldquo;into&rdquo; though they should. &ldquo;Within&rdquo; means &ldquo;being inside&rdquo; and &ldquo;without&rdquo; means &ldquo;remaining outside&rdquo;. &ldquo;On&rdquo; is used when something is above something else and touching it, for example, &ldquo;The book is on the table&rdquo;. When something is over something else but not touching it, that is, when there is a space between the two, then &ldquo;upon&rdquo; is used, for example, &ldquo;The ceiling fan is upon the head&rdquo;.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.17.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#17.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> &ldquo;Above&rdquo; is similar to &ldquo;upon&rdquo;. The difference is that &ldquo;above&rdquo; is used equally for material and immaterial situations, but &ldquo;upon&rdquo; is not used so much for immaterial cases. For example, &ldquo;He is looked upon as an elder brother but he is above all prejudice&rdquo;. In certain cases a long-standing idiom violates this rule. An example is &ldquo;Let him stand upon his own legs.&rdquo; When a person stands on their own legs, they stand right on their legs, not above them, thus in this case &ldquo;on&rdquo; is more proper. Of course some people do use &ldquo;on&rdquo;, that is, &ldquo;He stands on his own legs,&rdquo; however &ldquo;He stands upon his own legs&rdquo; is more idiomatic.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->At one time the word &ldquo;unto&rdquo; was very common in English. Nowadays this is no longer the practice though it is still used to some extent in biblical English. &ldquo;Unto&rdquo; used to be used in the sense of &ldquo;to&rdquo; and &ldquo;from&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Often we knowingly violate the rules of grammar for ease of use but this occurs in certain limited cases so it cannot be accepted as historical truth or ars&#x301;a prayoga.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.17.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#17.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  It would be better to consider it a common error. One cannot issue a grammatical ordinance and declare such usage forbidden. It is like saying in Bengali tini ekjan sambhra&#x301;nta pariba&#x301;rer santa&#x301;n [Literally, &ldquo;He is the child of a &lsquo;respected&rsquo; family&rdquo;] to mean tini ekjan abhija&#x301;t pariba&#x301;rer santa&#x301;n [&ldquo;He is the child of an aristocractic family&rdquo;]. The word sambhra&#x301;nta has been derived from sam &ndash; bhram + kta and its actual meaning is &ldquo;one who has made a big mistake&rdquo;. The Bengali words a&#x301;m [mango], lebu [citrus fruit], a&#x301;slo are such kinds of common errors. Similarly, many people use the words itipu&#x301;rve [formerly], itimadhye [meanwhile], nishcayata&#x301; [certainty], prasa&#x301;rata&#x301; [extension, width], etc. incorrectly. The same thing happens in Hindi when people say bhijin&#x32D;a for abhijin&#x32D;a and abhijin&#x32D;a for anabhijin&#x32D;a. Another example is maha&#x301;nata&#x301;; it should be mahattva&#x301; &ndash; in Sanskrit there is no such word as maha&#x301;nata&#x301;. Similar is the case with dar-asalme; it should be dar-asal &ndash; the word is Farsi and it means asaliiyat me. If someone says dar-asalme then this becomes asaliiyatme me. The same occurs with bepha&#x301;jul to mean ba&#x301;je [worthless]. Pha&#x301;jul means ba&#x301;je. If the Farsi prefix be is added then its meaning becomes &ldquo;that which is not worthless&rdquo;. If one says bepha&#x301;jul ba&#x301;t nahii karnii ca&#x301;hiye, then its meaning becomes &ldquo;one shouldn&#146;t say things that are not worthless&rdquo;, that is, one should say things that are worthless. Just see what it has come to!<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->The abstract noun for the adjective adhika [more] is a&#x301;dhikya or adhikata&#x301;, not a&#x301;dhikyata&#x301; because a&#x301;dhikyata&#x301; has a substantive-forming suffix added twice. However both you and I will agree that the literary quality that a&#x301;dhikyata&#x301; possesses (a&#x301;dikhyeta&#x301; in the spoken language) is not found in either adhikata&#x301; or a&#x301;dhikya. When we sit around gossiping and slandering during the rainy season, keeping time with the rain and eating our fried puffed rice, we use this word adikhyeta&#x301;. It is incomparably suggestive; we all agree on that. How can adhikata&#x301; or a&#x301;dhikya compare with such a delectable expression. It is like taking a hot potato cake right from the frying pan to your tongue.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Earlier I said that the locative case is used in most languages, especially in those languages that have a systematic grammar &ndash; they certainly have it. It cannot be denied that the locative case uses the seventh case-ending but it cannot be claimed that if the seventh case-ending is used then that necessarily makes it the locative case. In Bengali the seventh case is often used in place of the first. For example, pa&#x301;gale ki na&#x301; bale, cha&#x301;gale ki na&#x301; kha&#x301;y [What won&#146;t a fool say; what won&#146;t a goat eat]. In Hindi the seventh is used in place of the second, for example, saying mujhe ma&#x301;lum nehii [I don&#146;t know] instead of mujhko ma&#x301;lum nehii. In Bengali as well, the seventh case is used in place of the second. For example, a&#x301;ma&#x301;y da&#x301;o [give me] can be used instead of a&#x301;ma&#x301;ke da&#x301;o.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->I was discussing the use of the prepositions &ldquo;in&rdquo;, &ldquo;on&rdquo;, and so on. The French pronunciation of &ldquo;in&rdquo; is a&#x301;yn. The pronunciation of &ldquo;in&rdquo; became in when it crossed the English Channel from the shore opposite Dover and arrived in Cornwall, however &ldquo;on&rdquo; and &ldquo;upon&rdquo; did not come from French. The French un means &ldquo;one&rdquo;. The English &ldquo;an uncle&rdquo; is un oncle in French. &ldquo;An aunt&rdquo; is une tante. Anyhow the English indeclinable &ldquo;in&rdquo;, indicating the locative case, came into existence in this way but it does not have the same meaning in French as it does in English. All the locative-indicating indeclinables were created like this.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Apart from the locative-indicating indeclinables, in all those cases where the case is created by changing the word form, the seventh case word form becomes removed from the original word. However the change is less in all those words which end in an antahstha letter. For example, the seventh case singular form of the word nara is nare; ra is an antahstha letter. If any letter other than an antahstha letter is present then the distance increases. Hindi and Urdu follow the same rule in this regard. In the languages of Bihar man or ma&#x301;n are used. In other words, we can see that all languages have a locative case and a seventh case, even though they do not have a separate seventh case form as Sanskrit does. Instead, a seventh case indeclinable is used to indicate the locative case. It is my firm opinion in this matter that the locative case exists and should be accepted as such.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->The next subject of discussion is the vocative case. The vocative case has been accepted in Sanskrit but it has no fixed case-ending; it is not the eighth case. In some grammars the vocative has been accepted as a part of speech but not as a case. When considered from the standpoint of case and case-ending the locative case is the last case, but even so the vocative cannot be dismissed. In ancient times there was a need to call others from a long distance in the deep forest and this was the genesis of the vocative. In those days it was very important.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Although the vocative case has no direct connection with the verb it certainly has an indirect connection. This indirect connection appears especially in the imperative mood. For example, shuncho da&#x301;da&#x301;, ekva&#x301;r a&#x301;sbe [Listen Dada, come sometime]. Here the imperative verb a&#x301;sbe maintains an indirect link with the vocative da&#x301;da&#x301;. From some points of view, the vocative has to be accepted as a case when it maintains a link with the verb. How can we not accept the vocative as a case when we accept the dative so emphatically? Moreover, often the word form or case-ending in the vocative is different from the nominative. For example, the third person singular of the word ma&#x301;tr [mother] is ma&#x301;ta&#x301; but in the vocative it becomes ma&#x301;tah. &ldquo;Mother, come&rdquo; will be ma&#x301;tah a&#x301;gacchatu.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->Incidentally, words that end with the suffix trrn&#x301; add a visarga (h) in the vocative, for example, ma&#x301;tah, bhra&#x301;tah, pitah, and so on. The interesting thing is that these words which end with the suffix trrn are related to Latin, French, English and also a little to Farsi. One example is the Vedic word pitr (Its Rgvedic pronunciation is pitar, the Yajurvedic pronunciation is pitr, and the Atharvavedic pronunciation is pitru):<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..20"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Latin &ndash; pater<br>French &ndash; pere<br>English &ndash; father<br>Farsi &ndash; pedar<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="17..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->It is worth pointing out that each of these words ends in ra or &ldquo;r&rdquo;. The fixed rule for these words ending in trrn&#x301; is the sixth case ending uh and the vocative case-ending ah. For example, the sixth case is ma&#x301;tuh, pituh, etc. and the vocative is ma&#x301;tah, pitah, and so on.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->Up to now we have discussed different cases and case-endings. To sum up the discussion on case, the different case and case-ending forms can shown through a shloka:<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="17..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->The inclination within people to create words has a limitless value for the alteration of language and linguistic style. Many places in India and Southeast Asia have been named with the words pura, nagara, etc., added on. In Sanskrit small cities used to be called pura and large cities were called nagara (incidentally, the word pur is actually Farsi). The difference between the two was that a nagara used to be completely encircled by a wall which was called nagaraves&#x301;t&#x301;anii in Sanskrit. Those who used to live within the walls of the nagara were called na&#x301;garika. The word used today in English as a synonym for na&#x301;garika, &ldquo;citizen&rdquo;, bears no relation to the ancient word na&#x301;garika. Na&#x301;garika means &ldquo;inhabitant of a nagara&rdquo;, while &ldquo;citizen&rdquo;, the way it is used today, refers to any resident of a country whether they live in a city or in a rural village.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->Actually the word &ldquo;citizen&rdquo; means a resident of this kind of wall-enclosed city. Neither the English &ldquo;citizen&rdquo; nor the Bengali na&#x301;garika refers to the resident of a particular country. In other words, the pure English expression for the English word &ldquo;citizen&rdquo;, as we use it today, as well as for the word na&#x301;garika in Bengali, is &ldquo;bonafide inhabitant&rdquo;. The Farsi word for this is mulkii.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->This wall-enclosed city used to be called ha&#x301;belii in Urdu and ha&#x301;olii in Bhojpuri. There is a place in Monghyr District by the name of Habelii Kharagpur. According to the practice of those days the main gate of the ha&#x301;belii or nagara used to be closed at nine at night and the key used to remain with the city-father or the sheriff.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->Many places in India and Southeast Asia were named with the words pura, nagara, upanagara, etc. added on. We have taken many of these words from Farsi, for example, the Urdu word man&#x301;d&#x301;i meaning &ldquo;marketing centre&rdquo;; in Sanskrit it is called vipan&#x301;ana kendra or vipan&#x301;i, that is, &ldquo;where commodities are taken for the purposes of selling, or vipan&#x301;ana&rdquo;. Many people mistakenly use the word &ldquo;marketing&rdquo; to refer to shopping. Actually &ldquo;marketing&rdquo; means selling. The villagers go to the market or bazaar to sell their goods and produce, that is, they go for marketing. We go to the market to buy potatoes or pat&#x301;ol [wax gourd], that is, we go for shopping. The pure Bengali word for &ldquo;marketing centre&rdquo; or man&#x301;d&#x301;i is posta&#x301;. There is a Posta&#x301; Bazaar in Calcutta. Have you all read the famous poem by Sukumar Ray? Shunte pelum posta&#x301; giye/Toma&#x301;r na&#x301;ki meye viye [When I went to market/ I heard about your daughter&#146;s wedding].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->If a place has a village and a flourishing market for buying and selling then it is called a gain&#x32D;ja (ganj-a). The English distorted the pronunciation to ganj (spelled &ldquo;gunge&rdquo;). In this way the place called Ballygunge came from the name of Mr. Bailey, Tolleygunge from Mr. Tolley, and so on.

Although grammatically speaking the meaning of hat&#x301;t&#x301;ika should be &ldquo;small ha&#x301;t&#x301;&rdquo;, in actuality it was used to mean &ldquo;large ha&#x301;t&#x301;&rdquo;. The Bengali word which is derived from hat&#x301;t&#x301;a is ha&#x301;t&#x301;, for example, ra&#x301;ja&#x301;rha&#x301;t&#x301;, ba&#x301;gerha&#x301;t&#x301;, ma&#x301;jherha&#x301;t&#x301;, and so on. The Bengali word derived from the Sanskrit hat&#x301;t&#x301;ika is ha&#x301;t&#x301;i.

The modern languages descended from this Paesha&#x301;cii Pra&#x301;krta are Panjabi, Pahari (previously it was called Pahari-Panjabi) and Dogri. The Multani language, being a mixture of Panjabi and Sindhi, shows the influences of both Paesha&#x301;cii Pra&#x301;krta and Pahlavii Pra&#x301;krta. Even today these languages use many words derived from Vedic, for example, ind, pin&#x301;d&#x301;a, pin&#x301;d&#x301;i, etc. The village that was settled by the Rawal Brahmans of south India is Rawalpindi.

The place which had an abundance of these sha&#x301;l trees or indravrks&#x301;a was known as Indrapura &rarr; Indpur &rarr; Indpur, which is a village in Bankura District. The Pahlavii Pra&#x301;krta word put&#x301;t&#x301;ara or put&#x301;ra&#x301; comes from the Sanskrit word puttra. It is the same in modern Sindhi.

The area lying between these two rivers was the ancient Brahma&#x301;vartta or Brahmars&#x301;idesha which later on became Shu&#x301;rasena and even later was given the name Do-a&#x301;b in Farsi, that is, &ldquo;the land of two rivers&rdquo;.

One thing to keep in mind is that all those cities which have the word a&#x301;ba&#x301;d added at the end of their names were all named during the Pathan or Mughal era, or else later on, for example, Farrukhabad, Muzaffarabad, Alidabad, Jekovabad, Nasirabad (Mymensing), Jahangirabad (Dhaka), Islamabad (Chittagong), Phaejabad (Ayodhya), Shershahabad (Malda), Sharifabad (Burdwan&#146;s Paragana), etc. The new name of Burdwan is Va&#x301;r-e-Dewa&#x301;n and the name of Paragana is Sharifabad.

The reason behind this confusion is that in old Farsi we come across the word gain&#x32D;ja, while at the same time the word gain&#x32D;ja has been used in the spoken languages of north India since ancient times. So we can say that the word gain&#x32D;ja is as much Indian as it is Farsi.

However in Bengal the word neci with its special characteristics has found its way into our kitchens and pots and pans and rolling pins and mortars. Since ancient times the city of Burdwan has been influenced by north India so some of the residents of Burdwan say lei instead of leci or neci. Lei is actually a Hindustani word. The equivalent Sanskrit word for luci is shakkulii or sham&#x301;kulii. Luci and puri are not the same thing.

It is a Sanskrit-derived word. The Sanskrit synonyms for beguna are va&#x301;rta&#x301;ku, va&#x301;rta&#x301;kii, va&#x301;rtikii, brhatii, vrnta&#x301;ka, vyaun&#x32D;gana, and so on. From the Sanskrit word vyaun&#x32D;gana come the Bengali words begun, ba&#x301;igun, ba&#x301;igan, the Hindi word veigan, and so on.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..62"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=62 type=paragraph -->The long pointed brinjal (kulii begun) is called brhatii in Sanskrit. All brinjals come from China but this brhatii was the last to arrive. At evening time, when the jute factory coolies would return home, they used to enthusiastically buy this kind of brinjal and so it got the name kulii begun. The muktakeshii brinjal common in Bengal is called va&#x301;rta&#x301;ku in Sanskrit. The Sanskrit name for the white brinjal which many people consider inedible is vrnta&#x301;ka.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="17..65"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=65 type=paragraph -->Anyhow, this white brinjal is called [&ldquo;eggplant&rdquo;] in American English. The proper English for all varieties of begun is &ldquo;brinjal&rdquo;. Brinjal is called va&#x301;ta&#x301;yu&#x301; in Panjabi. This word comes from the Sanskrit word va&#x301;rta&#x301;ku. Brinjal came to our country from China a long time ago. There are many other names for it also in Sanskrit. Those of you who have an almanac at home will discover that on certain dates it is forbidden to eat va&#x301;rta&#x301;ku and on others vrnta&#x301;ka. At any rate, the be of the word begun is not a Farsi prefix.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..66"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=66 type=paragraph -->Another very common word in Bengali is ba&#x301;ha&#x301;dur. Many people think that this word may have come from Farsi. At first glance this seems to be so but actually it has not. There was a common word in Vedic, bhagadhara, which meant &ldquo;fortunate&rdquo;. This bhagadhara became bahadara in Pra&#x301;krta, from that baha&#x301;dar in Farsi, baha&#x301;dar in Panjabi, baha&#x301;dar or baha&#x301;dur in Urdu, bahadur in Hindi, and in Bengali we clean up this baha&#x301;dur, dress it in a dhoti and a shawl and set it loose as ba&#x301;ha&#x301;dur.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..67"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=67 type=paragraph -->There is a place in Mymensing District known as Bahadurabad. The word a&#x301;ba&#x301;d is, of course, Farsi but while the word ba&#x301;ha&#x301;dur may appear to be Farsi it is originally Vedic. In Bengali names one often comes across a mixture of two languages, for example, Ha&#x301;za&#x301;rila&#x301;l (Farsi-Hindi), Banoya&#x301;rila&#x301;l (Vrajabha&#x301;s&#x301;a&#x301;-Hindi), and Phajle Karim (Arabic-Farsi). If the latter were written in only Farsi then it should have been Kudrat-i-Khuda&#x301; and if it were only Arabic then it should have been Phazal-ul-Karim.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..68"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=68 type=paragraph -->The rule for compound words in Bengali is that if the first word is an adjective ending in a and the second word is suffixed by anat&#x301; or kta then the first word ending becomes ii. For example, bhasma + bhu&#x301;ta = bhasmiibhu&#x301;ta, nava + karan&#x301;a = naviikaran&#x301;a. stagita + karan&#x301;a = stagitiikaran&#x301;a, ghana + bhu&#x301;ta = ghaniibhu&#x301;ta, etc.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..69"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=69 type=paragraph -->In many people one can recognize a tendency to exclude foreign words. They like to say a&#x301;ra&#x301;m keda&#x301;ra&#x301; for &ldquo;easy-chair&rdquo; and jharn&#x301;a kalam for &ldquo;fountain pen&rdquo;, however both a&#x301;ra&#x301;m and keda&#x301;ra&#x301; in the word a&#x301;ra&#x301;m keda&#x301;ra&#x301; are foreign words. What is the justification for importing the foreign words a&#x301;ra&#x301;m and keda&#x301;ra&#x301; to replace the foreign word &ldquo;easy-chair&rdquo;? Although the word a&#x301;ra&#x301;m also exists in Sanskrit it has a different meaning. A&#x301;ra&#x301;m in Sanskrit means &ldquo;small house&rdquo; or &ldquo;garden house&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..70"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=70 type=paragraph -->Although the word jharn&#x301;a in the word jharn&#x301;akalam is native Indian, the word kalam is foreign. This kind of tendency cannot be considered beneficial from any point of view. People import and use words as a matter of necessity, and out of necessity we will sit in our &ldquo;easy-chair&rdquo; and write in our &ldquo;diary&rdquo; with our &ldquo;fountain-pen&rdquo;. When we feel the need we will even take a look at our &ldquo;notebook&rdquo;.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.17.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#17.fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> No one can object to this.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..71"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=71 type=paragraph -->Look, many of you cultivate [ca&#x301;s&#x301;-a&#x301;ba&#x301;d] your land, so even if it is a little outside the scope of this discussion I would like to point out that if you tell anyone ca&#x301;s&#x301;-a&#x301;ba&#x301;d kari [I cultivate] then you should know that the word ca&#x301;s&#x301; is a pure Bengali word and the word a&#x301;ba&#x301;d is Farsi. You mix the two when you cultivate. The blue-bloods or orthodox nobility in the world of grammar may find scholarly fault in this but I see no cause for objection. You can say ca&#x301;s&#x301;-a&#x301;ba&#x301;d just as happily as you practise it. The more you practise ca&#x301;s&#x301;-a&#x301;ba&#x301;d and develop it, the more you will find solutions to food problems. Right then.

<a name="18..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Last week we discussed the inclination for creating words. Often when we speak we say things like ca&#x301;-t&#x301;a&#x301;, ca&#x301;s&#x301;a&#x301;-bhu&#x301;s&#x301;a&#x301;, jal-t&#x301;al, nadii-t&#x301;adi, and so on. When we add a second word whose sound rhymes with the first word, are we doing this in error? Or are these added words completely meaningless?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->No, they are not meaningless. Human beings try to find rhythm in everything because human life itself is rhythmic. Movement is the natural characteristic of life so rhythm must exist within human movement. If life&#146;s movement were continuous or linear then there would be no scope for rhythm, and without rhythm there can be no happiness either. So in this universe all movement flows in the waves of systaltic order. It is in this rhythm that one encounters the sweetness inherent in movement. Thus people want rhythm in their actions; they want to enjoy the sweetness of the rhythmicity of movement.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Human beings also want to preserve this rhythmicity in their language. Mono-syllabic and bi-syllabic words lack rhythm so in this case an effort is made to introduce some rhythmic order. If one says simply ca&#x301;s&#x301;a&#x301;, ca&#x301;, jal, nadii, etc. the mind does not feel satisfied due to a lack of rhythm; so instead we say ca&#x301;-t&#x301;a&#x301;, ca&#x301;l-culo, jal-t&#x301;al, ca&#x301;s&#x301;a&#x301;-bhu&#x301;s&#x301;o. Granted, it does take more time to pronounce but it sounds better because one discovers a sense of rhythmic order there. Thus these kinds of words cannot be considered compound words. Rather they should be considered rhythmic words.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->This reminds me of an interesting story. Maharaja Manindra Chandra Nandi was the king of Ka&#x301;simba&#x301;ja&#x301;r. He used to remain busy with charity work, so much so that his charitable activities nearly left him destitute. There is a story about his charitableness. Once, during the time when the Maharaja was nearly destitute, a poor Brahman approached him. He told him about his distressful situation and asked him for money to help with the wedding of his daughter. Manindra Chandra was not in a position to give him anything but this made him feel extremely uncomfortable. Suddenly his eyes fell on the hookah he used for smoking tobacco. The basin of the hookah was covered with silver leaf. He told the Brahman: &ldquo;Look, I don&#146;t have anything to give you, but do one thing. Take my hookah. If you sell the silver in it you can get a little money.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Manindra Chandra had another great quality in addition to his charitableness. He was a very humorous fellow. There was a British magistrate who came to this country and learned Bengali quite well. Once he asked Manindra Chandra, &ldquo;Well now, why do you all say things like bha&#x301;t&#x301;-t&#x301;a&#x301;t, d&#x301;a&#x301;l-t&#x301;a&#x301;l in your Bengali language?&rdquo; I have just said that Manindra Chandra had a very humorous nature. Immediately he replied, &ldquo;Look here, educated people like me don&#146;t say things like this. Esab ca&#x301;s&#x301;a-bhu&#x301;sora&#x301;i bale-t&#x301;ale tha&#x301;ke [Only farmers [ca&#x301;s&#x301;a-bhu&#x301;sora&#x301;] talk [bale-t&#x301;ale] this way].&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->A similar kind of thing also happened in Burdwan although it did not concern rhythmic words but rather the different ways in which words are used. One day the magistrate&#146;s orderly, Bhajahari, did not show up for work. The next day the learned gentleman asked Bhajahari in Bengali, &ldquo;Bhajahari, why didn&#146;t you come to work yesterday?&rdquo; Bhajahari replied, &ldquo;Sir, I had a splitting headache yesterday.&rdquo;<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.18.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#18.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> The red face of the magistrate got even redder as he asked &ndash; &ldquo;Your head was caught. Who caught it? Why did they catch it? Who would willingly catch it? Grab them and bring them.&rdquo; Anyhow, there is a tendency to pronounce words in this way in all the world&#146;s languages. This is due to rhythm.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->The other day I was talking about the inclination for naming different places. That day I discussed how the modern pronunciations of certain historically renowned cities like Londres, Moscova and Roma are distortions of their earlier pronunciations, and that these modern distorted pronunciations are not correct. In the case of these foreign words it is distortion or error. There are also many such errors or distortions in Indian naming. In the case of foreign languages, the proper pronunciation of the capital of France is pa&#x301;rii [Paris] because in French a is pronounced like a&#x301;. Here the &ldquo;Pa&rdquo; is pronounced pa&#x301;, the ri is pronounced rii and the s is silent because there is a rule in French that if any consonant other than &ldquo;c&rdquo;, &ldquo;l&rdquo;, &ldquo;f&rdquo;, or &ldquo;r&rdquo; comes at the end of a word then it is silent. Thus the proper pronunciation of &ldquo;Paris&rdquo; is pa&#x301;rii. However ninety-nine percent of the people that I have heard pronounce it &ldquo;Paris&rdquo; instead of pa&#x301;rii. Another mistaken pronunciation that people make is &ldquo;Chicago&rdquo;. The proper pronunciation is shika&#x301;go. In the European languages &ldquo;ch&rdquo; is typically pronounced like sha rather than ca, so in the United States this city&#146;s name is pronounced shika&#x301;go rather than cika&#x301;go.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->There is a similar tendency in India&#146;s Assamese language. In Assamese ca is always pronounced like sha. For example, we write tincukiya&#x301; but we read it tinsukiya&#x301;. We write cit&#x301;iba&#x301;c but we read it sit&#x301;iba&#x301;s. Bear in mind that no word on this earth is meaningless. This should be kept in mind in the case of naming. So the distorted or incorrect pronunciation of proper nouns cannot be supported under any conditions. Proper nouns cannot be changed and must not be changed.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->At one time all of Vaun&#x32D;ga-D&#x301;aba&#x301;k, all of Samatat&#x301;-Ba&#x301;grii, the western portion of Cat&#x301;t&#x301;al, the southern part of Barendra and east Rarh, that is, east Midnapore, Hooghly, Howrah, east Burdwan and west Murshidabad, were all under water. Thereafter some land rose from the sea due to the accumulation of silt and sand from the Ganges, the Padma and the rivers of Rarh. This kind of silt and sand bank is called dviipa in Sanskrit &ndash; that is, &ldquo;land enclosed by water&rdquo;. After this alluvial land appeared, groups of people began migrating there from Rarh. When Sanskrit words evolve through the Pra&#x301;krta languages they undergo phonetic changes. According to the style of these phonetic changes, the ka, ta, pa, da in Sanskrit words become a in Pra&#x301;krta, especially in Ma&#x301;gadhii Pra&#x301;krta. Thus the Sanskrit dviipa became diia in Pra&#x301;krta and diiya&#x301; or diya&#x301; in Bengali. Many settlements have the word diiya&#x301; included in their name, for example, Nadiiya&#x301; from Navadviipa, Ha&#x301;thiiya&#x301; from Hastiidviipa, Shriiniva&#x301;sdiiya&#x301; from Shriiniva&#x301;sdviipa; Ma&#x301;jhdiiya&#x301; from Madhyadviipa, etc. Since Madhyadviipa became Majjhdiia and then Ma&#x301;jhdiiya&#x301;, it is spelled with jha and dii. People mistakenly write Ma&#x301;jdiya&#x301;. Incidentally, since western Rarh was never underwater you will not find places in western Rarh that have the word diiya included in their name. For the very same reason there are no villages or cities in the far north of Bengal that have diiya&#x301; in their name. On the other hand, there are a whole host of places with diiya&#x301; in their name in Hooghly, east Burdwan, Nadia, 24 Paraganas, Jessore, Khulna, Chittagong, and so on.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->I should point out one more thing in this regards. Approximately seven hundred or seven hundred and fifty years ago a terrible ocean storm caused great swells in the waters of the Bay of Bengal. Due to these swells, the water of the Bay of Bengal inundated one hundred and fifty miles inland. All of the settlements in that hundred and fifty miles were wiped out in the blink of an eye. Millions of people, cattle, animals and plants perished in a instant. Gradually the salt waters of the ocean receded and left behind a vast jungle with saline soil. Afterwards the people of western Rarh came in groups with their axes and scythes and other implements, cut down the jungle and colonized the area anew. If you look at the bloodlines of the people of 24 Paraganas you will find that they have come predominantly from Midnapore. Their surnames also reflect this. The spoken language of this region of 24 Paraganas also shows the influence of the languages spoken in the Contai and Tamaluk regions.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Everything was destroyed up to Nadia&#146;s Ranaghat. This jungle became filled with tigers, bears, rhinoceri, huge pythons, king cobras, and so on. As recent as a hundred and fifty years ago there were great numbers of rhinoceri in southern Bengal. Acharya Prafullachandra Roy wrote in his autobiography that during his childhood their tenants used to bring home rhinoceros meat. P. C. Roy was from Ra&#x301;r&#x301;ulii village in Khulna District. This village belongs to Pa&#x301;ikga&#x301;ch Tha&#x301;na&#x301; and a large area of this tha&#x301;na&#x301; falls within the Sundarbans.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->In Sanskrit and Pra&#x301;krta the suffixes aka, raka, ruka, etc. are added to mean &ldquo;small&rdquo;. For example, ma&#x301;nava [person] becomes ma&#x301;navaka [small boy or dwarf]. In English the suffixes &ldquo;let&rdquo;, &ldquo;kin&rdquo;, &ldquo;ock&rdquo;, etc. are added as diminutives. For example, &ldquo;rivulet&rdquo; comes from &ldquo;river&rdquo;, &ldquo;armlet&rdquo; from &ldquo;arm&rdquo;, &ldquo;mankin&rdquo; from &ldquo;man&rdquo;, &ldquo;hillock&rdquo; from &ldquo;hill&rdquo;, and so on. In Sanskrit vatsaruka &rarr; vaccharua &rarr; ba&#x301;chru. From this comes the word ba&#x301;chur [calf]. Go + ruka = goruka &rarr; gorua &rarr; goru [cow] (thus it is spelled with o &ndash; many people incorrectly spell this word garu). Similarly, the suffix raka is added to dviipa to mean &ldquo;small island&rdquo;. As such, dviiparaka &rarr; diiaraa in Pra&#x301;krta &rarr; diiya&#x301;ra&#x301; in Hindi, diiyar in Bhojpuri, dira&#x301; in Angika. However in Angika the word ca-a-r (car) is more common. In the Shershahabad Bengali dialect of Malda District these two words, dira&#x301; and car, are used side by side.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Earlier it was mentioned that the ka, ta, pa and da in Sanskrit words change into a in Pra&#x301;krta, especially in Ma&#x301;gadhii Pra&#x301;krta. Since the Sanskrit word diipa, which means &ldquo;lamp&rdquo; in English, has a pa at the end it changes into diia in Pra&#x301;krta. In the north Indo-Aryan languages it is called diiya&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->The word a&#x301;vali in Sanskrit denotes &ldquo;many-ness&rdquo; (a&#x301;valii is also correct, just as both kali and kalii are both correct). Thus diipa&#x301;valii in Sanskrit means &ldquo;many lamps&rdquo;. From this comes diia&#x301;oya&#x301;lii in Pra&#x301;krta and diioya&#x301;li (diiwa&#x301;li) in modern Hindi. In modern Bengali it is deoya&#x301;lii.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->There are some words which were used in old Bengali and medieval Bengali that are no longer used in modern Bengali, for example, Sanskrit darpan&#x301;a &rarr; Pra&#x301;krta dappana &rarr; old Bengali da&#x301;pan. The word da&#x301;pan was used in old Bengali and medieval Bengali but neither this word nor any corruption of it is used in modern Bengali. In medieval Bengali one comes across these lines:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..16"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Ha&#x301;ther ka&#x301;m&#x301;kan ma&#x301; leu da&#x301;pana<br>Appane appa&#x301; bujhata nia mana<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->They mean: &ldquo;Don&#146;t take a mirror to see the bracelets on your wrist/Understand yourself with your own mind.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Another Sanskrit synonym for &ldquo;mirror&rdquo;, mukura, used to be used in Bengali. Mukura is not used nowadays in the spoken language but it is used in the literary language. The common modern Bengali word a&#x301;rshii is a Sanskrit-derivative. The original Sanskrit word is a&#x301;darshii or a&#x301;darsha, either one. In Hindi both a&#x301;rshii and a&#x301;rsha&#x301; are used and the same holds true in Marathi. A&#x301;yana&#x301;, however, is a Farsi word. A&#x301;yana&#x301; in Farsi means both &ldquo;glass&rdquo; and &ldquo;mirror&rdquo;. A&#x301;yana&#x301; is an unnecessary Farsi word. There is no particular advantage in using the word a&#x301;yana&#x301; when Bengali already has its own word, a&#x301;rshii. While a&#x301;yana&#x301; means ka&#x301;ca [glass] (ka&#x301;ca is a Sanskrit word), the word siisa&#x301; is also used in Farsi for high-quality or thick glass, what is called sphat&#x301;ika in Sanskrit. In Bengali &ldquo;lead&rdquo; is called siisa&#x301;; its Sanskrit name is siisaka. The word siisa&#x301; does not mean &ldquo;glass&rdquo; in Bengali.<!-- /block --></p>

If we give up Farsi we may become cashamkhor&#x301; [shameless] (one who fails to see is called cashamkhor&#x301; in Farsi). Another meaning of the word cashma&#x301; in Farsi is &ldquo;fountain&rdquo;; it also means &ldquo;glass&rdquo; as well. In Kashmiri both cashma&#x301; and na&#x301;ga are used equally for &ldquo;fountain&rdquo;.

In Calcutta we find Na&#x301;rkold&#x301;a&#x301;un&#x32D;ga&#x301;. The former name of the place in Calcutta which is nowadays called College Square was Pat&#x301;old&#x301;a&#x301;un&#x32D;ga&#x301;; that is, the people used to cultivate pat&#x301;ol [wax gourd] in that d&#x301;a&#x301;un&#x32D;ga&#x301; which has risen from the bosom of the sea. At any rate, if one comes across a settlement with the word d&#x301;a&#x301;un&#x32D;ga&#x301; included in its name, one can be sure that that settlement has risen from the bottom of the sea. You will come across the word d&#x301;a&#x301;un&#x32D;ga&#x301; far less in lands which were not under water.<!-- /block --></p>

The station now called Bokaro Steel City was formerly called Mara&#x301; Pa&#x301;ha&#x301;rii. Many people used to mistakenly pronounce it Ma&#x301;ra&#x301;pha&#x301;r&#x301;ii. Mara&#x301; pa&#x301;ha&#x301;r&#x301;ii means a small hill of mara&#x301; [dead] stone. I myself have personally crushed and powdered a fistful of the stone from this area with my bare hands; For this reason it has been named Mara&#x301; Pa&#x301;ha&#x301;r&#x301;ii.

The next smaller is called a t&#x301;ila&#x301; and even smaller is a d&#x301;hibi, for example, ui-d&#x301;hibi [anthill]. Naturally, the name Ta&#x301;ld&#x301;a&#x301;m&#x301;ra&#x301; comes from the word d&#x301;a&#x301;mra&#x301;.

There are many such Austric words used in Bengali and d&#x301;a&#x301;un&#x32D;ga&#x301; is one of them. These Austric words are also plentiful in the Viirhor&#x301; language. In the Santhali Har&#x301; language Austric words have undergone some alteration. On the other hand, the Ora&#x301;n&#146;s Kuruk language is a Dravidian language. It has very few Austric words. Bengali has many Austric words such as d&#x301;a&#x301;un&#x32D;ga&#x301;, but Kuruk and other Dravidian languages have very few, although we cannot say that they have none at all.<!-- /block --></p>

Like Ir&#x301;a&#x301;pallii and Tirucira&#x301;pallii, we also have Bhat&#x301;t&#x301;apallii and Palliigra&#x301;m. No matter how much we try to polish and dress up the word pallii in an effort to pass it off as Sanskrit, it is originally Dravidian. Many people believe that the Bengali word pa&#x301;r&#x301;a&#x301; [neighbourhood] is a corruption of the word pallii. In other words, the word Pa&#x301;r&#x301;a&#x301;ga&#x301;n comes from Palliigra&#x301;ma. However this is erroneous. It is true that the word ga&#x301;n comes from the word gra&#x301;ma [village] but pa&#x301;r&#x301;a&#x301; does not come from pallii. Pa&#x301;r&#x301;a&#x301; is an eastern Indian word which is used extensively in Bengali, Assamese, Oriya, Nagpuri and Chattisgari. The Hindustani synonym for pa&#x301;r&#x301;a&#x301; is muhalla&#x301;. Where we say e pa&#x301;r&#x301;a&#x301;y [in this neighbourhood] in Bengali, we say is muhalla&#x301;me in Hindustani. The word muhalla&#x301; comes from Farsi. Incidentally, I should point out that in Sanskrit the word pallii does not mean pa&#x301;r&#x301;a&#x301;. In Sanskrit the word pallii means t&#x301;ikt&#x301;iki [a small house lizard] and krkala&#x301;sa means girgit&#x301;i [another variety of lizard]. This t&#x301;ikt&#x301;iki is called chipkalii in Hindi. In Maethilii, Magahii and Bhojpuri it is called bichaotii. In Angika it is called t&#x301;ikt&#x301;ikiya&#x301;, and you all know that in English it is called &ldquo;lizard&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>

We should not imitate others who say ma&#x301;sha&#x301;injor&#x301; or mya&#x301;sha&#x301;njor.

A place where an abundance of khayra&#x301; fish (khadira&#x301; matsya) can be found in its ponds, pools and creeks is called Khayra&#x301;sol (a small town on the outskirts of Birbhum).

Needless to say, the words d&#x301;ihi and d&#x301;iha&#x301; are both Austric. It should be noted that the villages and towns named d&#x301;ihi-d&#x301;iha&#x301; are not in the rainy part of Bengal (with a few exceptions). They are all located in western Rarh because western Rarh is a dry land. The localities in east Calcutta named d&#x301;ihi were most likely settled at the time by people from Rarh who cleared the Sundarbans and used the name d&#x301;ihi. Similarly, one does not come across villages or towns in western Rarh with the word diiya&#x301; in their name because diiya&#x301; is another name for dviipa [island]. Where will you find islands in the dry lands of western Rarh? However, the words jor&#x301;a&#x301; or jur&#x301;i are used in western Rarh in the names of villages or towns encircled by rivers, for example, Jerid&#x301;i and Shukjor&#x301;a&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>

Viirabhu&#x301;mi means viira&#x301;ca&#x301;rin&#x301;a&#x301;m&#x301; bhu&#x301;mi in Sanskrit and its altered name is Viirabhu&#x301;ma, or Varjyabhu&#x301;mi in Vedic. Its altered form is Varrabhu&#x301;mi and also Viirabhu&#x301;ma. Biira means &ldquo;forest&rdquo; in the Austric language. Biirabhu&#x301;mi means &ldquo;land abounding in forests&rdquo;. If the word is taken to mean &ldquo;forest&rdquo; then undoubtedly this creates an awkward combination because the word biira is Austric and the word bhu&#x301;mi is Sanskrit. Birbhum was undoubtedly once full of forests. Mamudbazaar Tha&#x301;na&#x301;, Rajnagar Tha&#x301;na&#x301;, Khayrasol Tha&#x301;na&#x301;, southwest Dumka, east Deoghar and west Pakur, which until 1855 was a part of Birbhum, were all full of forests. The word ra&#x301;r&#x301;ha&#x301; or ra&#x301;r&#x301;ho which we find in the Austric language means &ldquo;land of red soil&rdquo;. Similarly, if we accept the meaning &ldquo;forest&rdquo; for the Austric word biira then it can definitely offer an explanation behind the name Birbhum, Rarh&#146;s own cultural territory.

The area of Calcutta known nowadays as Entally was formerly called Henta&#x301;lii.

At that time different kinds of crops were grown in different areas of Calcutta.

The words saran&#x301;a, saran&#x301;ii, upasaran&#x301;ii and sa&#x301;ra&#x301;n&#x301;a in Rarhi Bengali all come from the verbal root sr. Incidentally, it is worth mentioning here that the builder of the Badshah Road, Shershah, came from the former Sahabad District&#146;s, modern Rohatas District&#146;s, Sasaram. The word s&#x301;asa&#x301;ra&#x301;m has also undergone distortion. It was named Sahasrara&#x301;ma or Sahasara&#x301;m after a famous local personage by the name of Sahasrara&#x301;m Singh.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.18.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#18.fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> This place is still called Sahasara&#x301;m in the local language, Bhojpuri.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..43"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=43 type=paragraph -->Bear in mind here that the words sara&#x301; and hat&#x301;a&#x301; are not identical in meaning. The word hat&#x301;a&#x301;, or hat&#x301;na&#x301; in Hindi, means &ldquo;to move from the front&rdquo; and sara&#x301; means &ldquo;to go on moving&rdquo;, so the work of sara&#x301; cannot be done by hat&#x301;a&#x301; or hat&#x301;na&#x301; although the work of hat&#x301;a&#x301; can be done by sara&#x301;. Another meaning of the word sara&#x301; in Bengali is &ldquo;to bring into use&rdquo;, for example, gha&#x301;t&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301; sara&#x301; hacche na&#x301; [the quay is not being used], ba&#x301;sant&#x301;a&#x301; sara&#x301; hacche na&#x301; [the container is not being used]. In the domestic life of Bengal, the container or utensil which is used often for regular needs is called sara&#x301; in Bengali rather than any other word.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..44"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=44 type=paragraph -->Southern Bengal did not have sufficient roads for land travel. People used to travel nearly everywhere by water with the exception of a few areas near Tripura.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.18.fn5"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#18.fn5">5</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  Imagine, for instance, that someone wants to go to Barishal&#146;s Bha&#x301;t&#x301;igra&#x301;m.

A steamer can travel down a large river or canal but not down a small river or canal; a boat is needed to travel down the small rivers and canals. Now the villages that used to be connected to the main waterways through canals [kha&#x301;l] were given the name kha&#x301;li, for example, Pat&#x301;uya&#x301;kha&#x301;li, Dhanekha&#x301;li, Jelekha&#x301;li, Sandeshkha&#x301;li, etc. When you see the name kha&#x301;li you can assume that there is or was a canal near that village, and that the canal joined a large waterway.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..45"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=45 type=paragraph -->The name khola&#x301; is attached to those villages which have no relation with any kha&#x301;l but which have very large trees full of birds, for example, Sharan&#x301;khola&#x301;, Harin&#x301;khola&#x301;, etc. Khola&#x301; is a native word which means &ldquo;bird&rdquo;. The Sanskrit synonyms for pa&#x301;khii [bird] are paks&#x301;ii, vihaga, vihaun&#x32D;ga, vihaun&#x32D;gama, and so forth. Similarly, the Sanskrit equivalents for &ldquo;deer&rdquo; are kuraga, kuraun&#x32D;ga, kuraun&#x32D;gama, etc. and for &ldquo;horse&rdquo; they are turaga, turaun&#x32D;ga, turaun&#x32D;gama, and so on.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..46"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=46 type=paragraph -->The word khola&#x301; has other meanings in Bengali. The first is the covering of a fruit or some such thing. You must have all seen a khola&#x301; ghar [house with a pantile roof] and also used the word. Here also the word khola&#x301; means &ldquo;covering&rdquo;. Two words are commonly used in Bengali to refer to the covering of a fruit &ndash; khola&#x301; and khosa&#x301;. If the covering is hard then it is called khola&#x301;, for example, the khola&#x301; of a coconut, but if it is soft then it is called khosa&#x301;. For example, a banana has a khosa&#x301;. However in Calcutta Bengali a banana skin and a coconut shell are both called khola&#x301;. Of course, there is a special word for coconut shell &ndash; ma&#x301;la&#x301; (na&#x301;rkoler ma&#x301;la&#x301;).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..47"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=47 type=paragraph -->Bengali has its own words for &ldquo;flower&rdquo; &ndash; moca&#x301; and muci. The word moca&#x301; means &ldquo;large flower&rdquo; and muci means &ldquo;small flower&rdquo;. Since a banana flower is large in size it is called moca&#x301;, but a coconut flower is quite small so it is called muci. The jackfruit flower is also called muci. In these kinds of philological discussions one learns not only the history of names but many other things as well, and in this way it becomes easy to narrow down the history.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="18..52"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=52 type=paragraph -->The names of some settlements in this country are inextricably linked to certain English names. After the British occupied India they imposed the &ldquo;policy of subsidiary alliance&rdquo;. As a result of this policy some kings in this country accepted the authority of the British, for example the kings of Tripura, Coochbihar and Mayurbhanj. They had a contract with the British. The British took their army into all those kingdoms where the kings or great landowners did not accept their authority. They allowed those who surrendered to them out of fear to keep their zamindarship, but they snatched away the kingdoms of those who did not accept their authority and fought against them. Then they installed their own obedient zamindars in their place. Something or other was named after all those British officers who achieved success in these campaigns. For example, after the kingdom of Palamu was defeated, the district headquarters city was named Daltonganj after Mr. Dalton. The Octorloney Monument in Calcutta maidan was built in the name of General Octorloney. Nowadays the Octorloney Monument has been renamed Shahid Minar. This is not proper since it is a distortion of history. Something new should have been dedicated to the memory of the Shahids. Similarly, they have made Pamarganj, Macluskeyganj, Leslieganj, and so on.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..53"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=53 type=paragraph -->Incidentally, it should be pointed out the English word &ldquo;general&rdquo; has undergone a distortion of pronunciation to become ja&#x301;ndrel in Bengali. We call powerful [jabardast] people ja&#x301;ndrel lok. Bear in mind that the word jabardast is Farsi. Dasta means &ldquo;hand&rdquo;, and if that hand is applied forcibly to something or possesses something forcibly then it is jabardast. In Panjabi &ldquo;general&rdquo; became ja&#x301;rna&#x301;l. If you look around a little you may able to find a couple of Ja&#x301;rna&#x301;l Singhs present.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="18..55"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=55 type=paragraph -->As a result of the Britishers&#146; distorted pronunciation the names of many famous cities in this country have become distorted. I have already talked about the distortion of the name Kalika&#x301;ta&#x301; (Calcutta) in this regard. A similar thing has happened with the city Bombay. Many fishing families were living in the suburbs of the modern city of Bombay. These fishing families were the old inhabitants of the city before it became Bombay. Their traditional deity was the goddess Mumba&#x301;vatii. Vatii becomes bai in Maha&#x301;ra&#x301;s&#x301;t&#x301;rii Pra&#x301;krta, so accordingly Mumba&#x301;vatii became Mumba&#x301;bai and, with the passage of time, Mumba&#x301;i. The word mumba&#x301;i has been common in both Marathi and Gujarati since that time and remains so. The British turned this Mumba&#x301;i into Bombay and this &ldquo;Bombay&rdquo; became Bomba&#x301;i in Hindi and Bengali. Kotha&#x301;ka&#x301;r jal kotha&#x301;y ese da&#x301;nr&#x301;a&#x301;la [Where does the water come from; where does it end up?].<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.18.fn10"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#18.fn10">10</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> Recently the government of Maharashtra has changed the name Bomba&#x301;i to Mumba&#x301;i. This is a praiseworthy action. Calcutta should promptly be changed to Kalika&#x301;ta&#x301; in English. Why should the same proper noun be called differently by different people! This destroys the sense of value of a proper noun. If you ask someone named Sardar Hazara Singh his name will he say that his name is &ldquo;Leader Thousand Lions&rdquo;? Should we call Krishnanagar &ldquo;Black City&rdquo; in English? Someone who gets a kick out of calling Krishnanagar &ldquo;Black City&rdquo; should follow suit and call Calcutta &ldquo;Lime and Rope&rdquo;. Only then will their penchant for imitation be complete.<!-- /block --></p>

<p class=footnotes_title>Footnotes</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="18.fn1"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.18.fn1">1</a></b>)  The literal idiom is: &ldquo;My head was badly caught&rdquo;. The words used by the magistrate are all spelt with d&#x301;h instead of dha and t&#x301;a instead of ta to highlight the inability of the English to pronounce the dental letters. &ndash;Trans.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="18.fn2"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.18.fn2">2</a></b>)  Poppy seed is a constipative food. &ndash;Trans.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="18.fn3"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.18.fn3">3</a></b>)  In the literary language nowadays it has been made into vam&#x301;shava&#x301;t&#x301;i but this is incorrect. The literary form of ba&#x301;m&#x301;shber&#x301;e is not vam&#x301;shava&#x301;t&#x301;i. If the original form had been vam&#x301;shava&#x301;t&#x301;i then language its modern southern Bengali form would have been ba&#x301;m&#x301;shba&#x301;r&#x301;i, not ba&#x301;m&#x301;shber&#x301;e. So since the colloquial name is Ba&#x301;m&#x301;shber&#x301;e then the old name of the place was certainly Vam&#x301;shava&#x301;t&#x301;ika&#x301;.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="18.fn4"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.18.fn4">4</a></b>)  I did not use the word vyakti [individual] because this word is incorrect from head to toe. The linguistic scholars may be able to tell us at what auspicious moment the word vyakti came to mean &ldquo;person&rdquo;. That is not a task for ordinary people like myself. The word vyakti means &ldquo;to make manifest&rdquo;. If the needlework that women do on cloth is called su&#x301;ciivyakti then I have no objections. However, calling a person vyakti raises strong cause for objection.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="18.fn5"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.18.fn5">5</a></b>)   Comilla &ndash; Comilla is surrounded by lowlands. Even the two nearby subdivisions, Bra&#x301;hmanber&#x301;iya&#x301; and Ca&#x301;ndpur, are lowlands. However, the city itself of tank, bank, datta and rasamalai, Comilla, is an elevated area [d&#x301;a&#x301;un&#x32D;ga&#x301;] where the bullock cart is more common than the boat.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="18.fn6"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.18.fn6">6</a></b>)  &ldquo;Steamer&rdquo; is an English word. In Bengali one says ja&#x301;ha&#x301;j, although ja&#x301;ha&#x301;j is a Farsi word. The Sanskrit word is arn&#x301;avapota. The word ja&#x301;ha&#x301;j is more common in Bengali than arn&#x301;avapota.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="18.fn7"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.18.fn7">7</a></b>)   In Bengali the word used for the measurement of the depth of water is ba&#x301;no. The corresponding English word is &ldquo;fathom&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="18.fn8"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.18.fn8">8</a></b>)  In very ancient times boats were used in western Rarh as well. The masts of ships have been discovered while cultivating the extremely fertile region of the Ajay and Mayurakshi rivers. However they are from many ages ago.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="18.fn9"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.18.fn9">9</a></b>)  In old Bengali, rivers used to be called nai or lai. There is a river running through Birbhum and Dumka districts whose proper name is Va&#x301;n&#x32D;shnadii but whose common name in Va&#x301;n&#x32D;shlai.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="18.fn10"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.18.fn10">10</a></b>)  A proverb implying that its origin was one thing but it ended up as something else. &ndash;Trans.</p>

<a name="19..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Up until this point we have been discussing the naming of places and things. A boy named A&#x301;diyta has just danced kaos&#x301;ikii for us. What is the meaning of the name A&#x301;ditya? In old Sanskrit the word a&#x301;ditya means &ldquo;one who collects what is due to them&rdquo;. After the death of a living being their quinquelemental existence &ndash; that is, solid, liquid, luminous, aerial, ethereal &ndash; these five factors collect what is due to them. The stars, planets, atoms and molecules, these luminaries and particles are an aggregate of twelve factors. Since each one of them collects what is due to them they are called &ldquo;the twelve a&#x301;dityas&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Now this garland of rajaniigandha&#x301; [tuberose] that you see here &ndash; how did this flower get its name? Rabindranath has written in one of his poems: ra&#x301;ja&#x301;r ka&#x301;nane phut&#x301;eche vakul-pa&#x301;rul-rajaniigandha&#x301; [vakul, pa&#x301;rul and rajaniigandha&#x301; flowers have blossomed in the king&#146;s garden]. However during the time in history depicted in this poem, that is, during the time of Magadh&#146;s King Bimbisar, there was no such rajaniigandha&#x301; flower in India. It was only four hundred and fifty years ago that the Portuguese first brought the rajaniigandha&#x301; from Mexico and planted it in the garden of their Bandel church. The original home of this flower was Central American Mexico. Its English name is &ldquo;tuberose&rdquo;. Like the shuili flower, the tuberose is full of fragrant pollen. During the day the breeze becomes light in the heat of the sun. As a result it cannot easily carry the fragrant pollen of the rajaniigandha&#x301;. But during the night the breeze becomes strong and easily carries the scent; for this reason the tuberose brought by the Portuguese was given the name rajaniigandha&#x301; [literally: night-scent] in Bengali. One can also smell the rajaniigandha&#x301; during cloudy days and solar eclipses.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Anyhow, last week I was talking about the names of places. The giving of Sanskrit names is not only confined to India; in many countries outside India the giving of names shows the influence of Sanskrit. At one time the Sanskrit language was used throughout the vast region extending from southern Russia all the way to Suvarn&#x301;adviipa. The southern region of Russia &ndash; what is today Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Tajikistan &ndash; used to be called Sha&#x301;kadviipa. And the combined name of India and Afghanistan at that time was Jambudviipa, You must have heard the mantra jambudviipe bha&#x301;ratakhan&#x301;d&#x301;e. Of course at that time Afghanistan was part of India. The name for Burma and all of southeast Asia was Suvarn&#x301;adviipa. Sanskrit is still used to speak with the king of Thailand, however it is pronounced differently. For example, in Thailand ja is pronounced like d&#x301;a and n&#x301;a is pronounced like d&#x301;ha, and ya and ya [with dot] are both pronounced like ya [ja]. The name of the kingdom of Kamboja is pronounced nowadays Kambod&#x301;iya&#x301; by the people. At that time the kingdom of Kamboja was much larger than the present-day Cambodia. At one time there was a huge Shiva temple there called Ounka&#x301;rabhat&#x301;t&#x301;a. Its modern name is Ounka&#x301;r Bha&#x301;t&#x301;. Now the temple has been practically ruined.<!-- /block --></p>

But since n&#x301;a is pronounced like d&#x301;ha in the Thai style of pronunciation, if you asked the driver&#146;s name he would reply Krs&#x301;d&#x301;had&#x301;a&#x301;s.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->One also sees the influence of Sanskrit pronunciation in Indonesia. One famous city in Indonesia is Jakarta. Its Sanskrit name in the past was Yogyakartta&#x301;. Thus, according to the style of pronunciation there, it became Yogaya&#x301;kartta&#x301;, Jakarta for short.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->The Sanskrit name for the land we now call Java is Yavadviipa. Its capital was Va&#x301;ta&#x301;vipura. The modern name Batavia comes from this Va&#x301;ta&#x301;vipura. When the Dutch [olanda&#x301;j] came to India in the last part of the Mughal era, they brought a variety of lemon with them from Va&#x301;ta&#x301;viipura which they first planted in the present-day city of Chinsura [Cuncr&#x301;o].<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.19.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#19.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> The Dutch had a factory in Chinsura and they christened the city &ldquo;Chinsura&rdquo;. The modern Dutch pronunciation was sya&#x301;nsura&#x301; and in Bengali it became cuncur&#x301;a&#x301;, cuncr&#x301;o in spoken Bengali. When I was staying in Holland I spoke with a few scholars about Cuncr&#x301;o and I found that none of them were conversant with Cuncr&#x301;o. One of them said: &ldquo;I have never heard anything in the history about Cuncr&#x301;o but the word cuncr&#x301;o is from our language.&rdquo; I have seen a place in Cuncr&#x301;o called &ldquo;Dutch Villa&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>

In Calcutta Bengali we call mat&#x301;arshunt&#x301;i [peas] kara&#x301;ishunt&#x301;i. Although they are not as good as regular peas for making da&#x301;l, they are quite tasty when eaten fresh in the pod. At one time the village people of Hooghly District used to love to eat these pods with puffed rice. They used to cultivate them as well.

<a name="19..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->The Batavia lemon [pomelo] that I was talking about is a well-known name in Bengal nowadays. It does not have any true Sanskrit name, however the Sanskrit name for the somewhat smaller, sweet and sour lemon that was already common in this country was maha&#x301;laun&#x32D;ga. Nowadays the maha&#x301;laun&#x32D;ga has gotten lost in the crowd of Batavia lemons. The Sanskrit name of the lemon that is a little smaller than the maha&#x301;laun&#x32D;ga and a little elongated, and which was already in this country is jambiira; its modern popular name is ja&#x301;mir or ja&#x301;merii or jambura&#x301;. The jambiira did not come from outside India. It has also gotten lost nowadays in the crowd of Batavia lemons. Keep in mind that although the Batavia lemon came to this country from Java, it is native to all of Southeast Asia, that is, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines (this country&#146;s Sanskrit name is Maha&#x301;rlika&#x301; or Maha&#x301;rliin&#x301;a&#x301;). The Sanskrit name of the sweet and juicy lemon called maosambii in Urdu and sharvatii in Bengali is shiitanimbu; it is smaller than the jambiira and quite plentiful in this country. Nowadays the name maosambii is more common in Bengali, however it would not be right to forget the Bengali name, sharvatii nebu. This sharvatii nebu belongs to the nebu family, not the kamala&#x301; family. Nebu in English is &ldquo;lemon&rdquo;; in Sanskrit it is nimbu; in Hindi niimbu; in Angika nemu; and in Bengali nebu &ndash; some people mistakenly say lebu. Kamala&#x301; in English is &ldquo;orange&rdquo;. In Sanskrit it is kamala&#x301; or na&#x301;garaun&#x32D;ga, in Urdu na&#x301;ra&#x301;ungi, in Marathi sa&#x301;ntara&#x301; and in Bengali kamala&#x301;. The main difference between the nebu family (sharvatii or sweet lemon, jambiira, maha&#x301;laun&#x32D;ga, Batavi or lemon pomelo, pa&#x301;ti, ka&#x301;gjii, etc.) and the kamala&#x301; family (orange &ndash; Sanskrit na&#x301;garaun&#x32D;ga group) is that the rind of the nebu is not easily removed. It is cut with a knife or chopper. But the skin of the kamala&#x301; family (Sylheti kamala&#x301;, Assam kamala&#x301;, Meghalay kamala&#x301;, Darjeeling kamala&#x301;, Nagpuri kamala&#x301; or Khoka&#x301;kamala&#x301;, gonr&#x301;a&#x301; nebu, gonr&#x301;a&#x301; kamala&#x301;, etc.) is easily peeled and the sections inside come apart. The keno nebu, quite common nowadays, is a mix between the lemon and orange families. In those days India was producing less sugar so it used to be imported from Batavia in Indonesia. Hence the colloquial name for sugar [cini] among the people became ba&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301; cini (during our young days ba&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301; cini and Barishal&#146;s ba&#x301;la&#x301;m rice were very common in Calcutta).<!-- /block --></p>

In Indian society they became known as the Sha&#x301;kadviipii Brahmans. They mostly kept themselves busy studying astrology and Ayurveda. They used to wear loose pyjama pants with a jacket on their upper body and a Fez cap. Although they were followers of the Rs&#x301;is they did not always follow the Vedic customs in their sacrifices and rituals. Furthermore, they were worshippers of the sun god. So the images of the sun god they worshipped that are found in the different sun god temples are also dressed in loose pyjama pants with a Fez cap on the head and a rosary in the hands, what we call ja&#x301;pa&#x301;ma&#x301;la&#x301; in Bengali. Thus it is said that it is more of a non-Hindu sun god. This kind of sun god temple is found in several places in India.

Later on, the demonic dogmas of the Sha&#x301;kadviipii Brahmans in north India extended their limiting influence over the physicians as well and slowly the Vaedyaka practitioners abandoned the dissection of cadavers.

The British planned to build the port of Canning on the banks of the Ma&#x301;tla&#x301; but the Ma&#x301;tla&#x301; is no longer actually a river. It is an ordinary estuary [kha&#x301;r&#x301;ii].

The Vidya&#x301;dharii that flows from this southern outlet used to change its course practically every year. Later the area turned into a salty swamp so the British named it the Salt Lake area. This area was full of trees and plants that favoured salty soil. There was a jungle of gol, ba&#x301;in, hinta&#x301;l, mangosteen and mangrove. The salty seawater inundated the area during floodtide and made it even more frightening. There were a number of eddies. Packs of jackals used to roam there in broad daylight.

It was an unhealthy saltwater area full of mosquito-infested jungle and undergrowth. Farming was not very successful there.

Although the alligator variety of crocodile lives in various regions from the tropic of Cancer to the equator to the tropic of Capricorn, their primary home is the Amazon River-basin in Brazil. In other words they are not gangelitis but rather amazonika.

There used to be an especially brisk trade in the paintings of different Hindu gods and goddesses. The women who worshipped Lakshmi year-round used to do it with paintings. When Durgapuja began during the Pathan era only the zamindars used to make idols for their worship. The middle class people who used to celebrate Durgapuja at home would use paintings. Those who could not afford to buy paintings would celebrate it with earthen pots. Even as recently as one hundred years ago Saraswati puja used to be performed chiefly with earthen pots.

No one dared travel that path alone, even in broad daylight, what to speak of at night. When they would go to perform Kali puja in the Kali temple they would travel in groups of forty or fifty persons and take their staffs and cudgels with them. Otherwise they would be killed by highwaymen. It is said that the highwaymen used to kill people in broad daylight and hang them from trees. The ashram of Caoraungii Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; was in the Govindapur area (the Na&#x301;th yogi Caoraungiina&#x301;th). Caoraungii Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; was pained to see the distress of the pilgrims so he had his disciples carve out a road through the jungle to Kalighat. For a long time this road was known as Caoraungii Ba&#x301;ba&#x301;&#146;s road. I cannot understand why those who have completely or partially changed the name of this road have done so. Dharmara&#x301;j T&#x301;hakur&#146;s place was a little to the east of Caoraungii Ba&#x301;ba&#x301;&#146;s ashram. Dharmara&#x301;j was another name for Buddha.

Dharmara&#x301;j puja was common to some extent in central Bengal and throughout Rarh. In Birbhum and Bankura, Dharmara&#x301;j was regarded as the non-Brahman-worshipped Shiva right from the beginning. In certain parts of eastern Rarh and central Bengal, Dharmara&#x301;j acquired the appellation Bur&#x301;o Shiva. In many villages and towns of this region there is a Bur&#x301;o Shivatala&#x301; as well as a Dharmara&#x301;jtala&#x301;. The difference was that the majority of the worshippers of Dharmara&#x301;j were non-Brahmans, that is, people belonging to the [[Ja&#x301;t Bengalees]], chiefly Kaevarta and Sadgopa. They were generally known by the name Deva&#x301;m&#x301;shi. The worshippers of Bur&#x301;o Shiva, however, were predominantly Buddhist Brahmans with the surname Cakravartii.

Modern ladies who cook are unfamiliar with the way mug-sha&#x301;uli was actually prepared. But I would guess that it was prepared by boiling the whole mung in milk after removing the husk and then frying it in a little ghee with cloves, sugar and cassia leaf. Mugkhan&#x301;d&#x301;a used to be prepared in those days in a similar way. The consumption of mung burfi as a sweet had probably not become common yet.

<a name="19..44"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=44 type=paragraph -->Let us return to the subject of pulse. Whether or not it was used in old Bengal, there is little doubt that pulse was not a favourite food of the people.

Gima&#x301; sha&#x301;k, tita&#x301; sha&#x301;k, helein&#x32D;ca&#x301; sha&#x301;k (hiin&#x32D;ce sha&#x301;k in Calcutta Bengali), etc. were popular foods.

There is no relationship, however, between the word pa&#x301;lam&#x301; and Faridpur District&#146;s famous Pa&#x301;laun village. At one time the people of this village in southern Vikrampur were very hospitable, or extremely pa&#x301;lanka&#x301;ri [caring], so the name of the village became Pa&#x301;launkya&#x301; which in turn became Pa&#x301;laun later on.

The rukh here comes from the Sanskrit word vrks&#x301;a. Sanskrit vrks&#x301;a &rarr; riks&#x301;a &rarr; ruks&#x301;a &rarr; rukh. Generally, whenever r is joined to a consonant in Sanskrit then in Ma&#x301;gadhii Pra&#x301;krta it is taken as if the r were not there. For example, nrtya becomes nacca, vrddha becomes vad&#x301;hd&#x301;ha &rarr; vud&#x301;d&#x301;ha &rarr; bur&#x301;a&#x301; &rarr; bur&#x301;o. If there is only r then it becomes i in the Yajurvedic style. In the Atharvavedic style it becomes u. For example, rs&#x301;i becomes isi and rju becomes uju. In the aforementioned verse it would have been more correct had vrks&#x301;a been changed into vaks&#x301;a but since the pronunciation of antahstha va is vowel-like, vrks&#x301;a in the Atharvavedic style becomes ruks&#x301;a and from that comes the old Bengali rukh. Of course there are exceptions also. For example, the Sanskrit vaks&#x301;a becomes bukka in Pra&#x301;krta and from that buk in modern Bengali. The name of the place where Lord Buddha initiated his first five disciples was Sa&#x301;raun&#x32D;gana&#x301;th; nowadays it has become Sa&#x301;rnath.

The name of this place in Angadesh underwent change and became Monghyr. In the Pathan era its distorted name became Mungher. Monghyr was the last capital of Bengal during the Mughal era. Its nawab was Mirka&#x301;ssim. The fort from those days and the arsenal bazaar originally made for muskets and canons still exist in Monghyr. There is a Kasimbazaar named after the nawab as well as the Kar&#x301;eya&#x301; parade grounds for military parades. There are rest houses called Sara&#x301;i here and there in the city for travellers. At that time travellers&#146; lodges were called sara&#x301;i in Farsi. In the Indian languages they were called cat&#x301;i. Long-distance travellers would rest there. In some places the kings or nawabs made arrangements to provide food and in some places there were almshouses. In some places rice, pulse, salt and wood were stored there and the travellers would cook their own food. Sophiya&#x301;sara&#x301;i and Pu&#x301;ravsara&#x301;i were near Monghyr and Laks&#x301;miisara&#x301;i was a little further away. Burdwan was also the capital of Bengal at one time.

<a name="19..71"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=71 type=paragraph -->So we were talking about Mudgagiri, which was the last capital of Bengal during the era of the Nawabs and the second capital of Anga in olden times. At that time the Ras&#x301;t&#x301;rakut&#146;s were a dominant force in west India. They took possession of Monghyr for a short time and they also designated it as their second capital. This was most probably during the time of Mahendra Pal. Monghyr&#146;s history dates back to the Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata when Karna was the king of Angadesh. Angadesh&#146;s main capital then was Campaknagar (present-day Campa&#x301;nagar near Na&#x301;thnagar). Although there is no connection between the historical Karna and Monghyr&#146;s historically famous Karn&#x301;acu&#x301;r&#x301;a&#x301; palace, the hillock on which the palace is situated is named after Maharaja Karna. During the time of the Pal kings Bengal&#146;s impenetrable fort was on the south side of the Ganges. The fall of Monghyr speeded the fall of the Pal kings and opened the doors for the Pathan invasion. As a result the historically renowned Vikramshila University located to the east of Monghyr near Bhagalpur was destroyed (Bhagalpur&#146;s nearby Antichak village).<!-- /block --></p>

Golden mung has been cultivated in the clayey soil of central Bengal for a very long time; it is incomparable in taste, smell and sentiency. However there is no way of knowing if the mung mentioned in the Bengali literature of the middle ages is the s&#x301;a&#x301;t&#x301;ha&#x301; variety of golden mung or some other variety of mung because in the Rarh region ghor&#x301;a&#x301; mung or gheso mung is cultivated more than golden mung.

It has been grouped in the gram family. For example, mung is called &ldquo;green gram&rdquo;; biri kala&#x301;i or ma&#x301;s&#x301; kala&#x301;i (in Calcutta we say biuli) is black gram; kurthii kala&#x301;i or kulattha kala&#x301;i is &ldquo;horse gram&rdquo;; chola&#x301; is &ldquo;Bengal gram&rdquo; (bun&#x301;t&#x301;ika or can&#x301;aka in Sanskrit; but&#x301; in Rarh and Bihar; rahila&#x301; in  Bhojpuri; can&#x301;a&#x301; in Hindi; harbar&#x301;a&#x301; in Marathi). The British first came into contact with chola&#x301; on both banks of Burdwan District&#146;s Kunur River (it begins in the Budbud jungle and merges in the Ajay near Kogra&#x301;m) so they named it &ldquo;Bengal gram&rdquo;.

Girivraja or Ra&#x301;jagiri was the capital of Magadh during the time of Bimbisar, that is, during Buddha&#146;s time. It suffered from a lack of water so there was a need for a plentiful water supply in the capital. Once the Buddha stood at the place where the Ganges and Shon rivers meet and said that if the capital were there it would be advantageous in every respect. Among the disciples of the Buddha present was a merchant by the name of Pataliputra. At that time there was a synthesis between the matrilineal and patrilineal systems with respect to giving names. The mother&#146;s name was Ru&#x301;pasa&#x301;ri so the son was named Sa&#x301;riputta. The mother&#146;s name was Maha&#x301;maodgalii (Maha&#x301;maggali) so her son was named Maha&#x301;maodagallan Arahan&#x301; (Maha&#x301;maggallan). Similarly his mother&#146;s name was Pat&#x301;alii so he was named Pat&#x301;aliiputra. This Pataliputra took on the responsibility of building a city at that spot so the city was named Pataliputra after him. Kusumpur was destroyed and Pataliputra was built in its place. Time and again the Shon changed its course and time and again Pataliputra was destroyed. When one Pataliputra disappeared another was founded on top of it.

Among the five districts in Orissa at that time (Cuttack, Puri, Baleshwar, Sambalpur, and Aungul-Khondamahal), only Cuttack had Ravenshaw College, so Ka&#x301;nthi&#146;s educational importance must indeed be recognized.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..85"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=85 type=paragraph -->I and many of my friends were forced to go to college in Calcutta due to the scarcity of colleges in the provinces of Bihar and Orissa at that time. Ka&#x301;nthi&#146;s Sanskritic and cultural importance cannot be denied. It would not be bad if a Sanskrit university could be established there. It is my firm opinion that the poet Kalidas was a resident of this Ka&#x301;nthi region. The all-round development of Ka&#x301;nthi would afford many opportunities and conveniences. I would like to direct the attention of the concerned people there.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..86"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=86 type=paragraph -->It would be very good if a railway line were extended from Haldiya&#x301; to Da&#x301;ntan via Ka&#x301;nthi-Diigha&#x301;. This would bring a new day&#146;s glow to the city of Ka&#x301;nthi and at the same time would foster the development of Haldiya&#x301; port. The sandy town of Diigha&#x301; would become a favourite of the people and south Midnapore would be bathed in a new light. Not only that, it would enable the local fisher-folk, banana farmers, betel farmers and flower farmers to expect a proper return for their commodities. If arokedia variety trees (Japanese tamarisk) are planted by the ocean their lustrous growth would also help matters by providing protection against ocean storms because this kind of tree has the capacity to serve as an obstacle to cyclones. It would be even better if a type of marine drive were built along the ocean from Haldiya&#x301; to the mouth of the Suvarnarekha River. This would not only prove attractive to travellers, but would also foster the development of smaller and larger trade centres and towns on the roadside. It would promote the economic prosperity of the local people. Many sea-dependent industries should be developed in the region lying between Ka&#x301;nthi and Junput&#x301;. A small port should also be developed near Ka&#x301;nthi at the mouth of the Rasulpur River. Since it can take advantage of natural conveniences, the port would not entail much expenditure.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..87"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=87 type=paragraph -->The area below any large tree is called tala&#x301; or talii.

If a particular place is used for some particular thing or particular work then in that case tala&#x301; is used. Talii, however, is not used in such cases. Some examples are: Can&#x301;d&#x301;iitala&#x301; (Hooghly), Ka&#x301;liitala&#x301;, Pain&#x32D;ca&#x301;nantala&#x301; (Chandannagar), Ma&#x301;ca&#x301;ntala&#x301; (Bankura), Por&#x301;a&#x301;ma&#x301;tala&#x301; (Navadviipa), S&#x301;as&#x301;t&#x301;hiitala&#x301; (Krishnanagar), Bur&#x301;o Shivatala&#x301; (Chandannagar), etc. Besides this many places have a Ha&#x301;t&#x301;tala&#x301; and a Rathtala&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>

The concerning kings were considered thereafter as the zamindars of those areas and they used to deposit their land revenue in the collectory. They were not considered native kings in those regions but instead became zamindars. In the remaining portions of their lands they were considered native kings.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..91"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=91 type=paragraph -->The British left the mountainous eastern portion of Tripura in the hands of the Maharaja. In that region the Maharaja of Tripura was a native king and he had his capital there. The densely populated, fertile areas in the west of his kingdom were incorporated into British India. In this way they formed the Brahmanbaria Subdivision from part of the former Kingdom of Tripura and part of the former Sylhet District; along with that they formed British Tripura or Tipperah out of Chandpur and the Comilla district headquarters. Since this British Tripura or Tipperah District was densely populated there was no need to colonize it anew but the Maharaja of Tripura remained the zamindar of a substantial part of this district. He used to deposit the land revenue in the Comilla collectory. He remained the native king in the remaining portion, which was part of Tripura. The spoken Bengali of the Kingdom of Tripura is Sylheti Bengali in the north and Noya&#x301;kha&#x301;li Bengali in the south, which is a blending of Chittagong Bengali and Sylheti Bengali.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..92"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=92 type=paragraph -->Similarly, the British incorporated a vast region from the former kingdom of Coochbihar (its former name was also Ka&#x301;mta&#x301;pur) into British Bengal. They only left eight tha&#x301;na&#x301;s (Coochbihar, Ma&#x301;tha&#x301;bha&#x301;un&#x32D;ga&#x301;, Dinha&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301;, Shiitalkuci, Haldiba&#x301;r&#x301;i, Mekhligainj, Sita&#x301;i, Tupha&#x301;ngainj) under the control of the Maharaja. Rangpur District of the then Province of Bengal was formed out of the areas that the British took control of. Since this region was also more or less densely populated there was no need to make many new land leases. But in the northern part of this region, private lands, or in a few cases leased lands, were appropriated for numerous tea plantations without paying loss compensation, or paying compensation in name only. Since the eastern part of Rangpur District was less populated, many farmers were brought in from outside and land tenures were drawn up. After Rangpur District grew very big it was divided into three parts. The name of the southern portion remained Rangpur. The north was made into a new district, Jalpaiguri, and the northeast portion became Northeast Rangpur District. When the Province of Assam was created in 1912 this Northeast Rangpur District was incorporated into it. Rangpur remained in Bengal Province and Northeast Rangpur was made part of Assam Province. Being somewhat incompatible, northeast Rangpur&#146;s name was changed to Goyalpara. Dhubr&#x301;i was made the district headquarters. The spoken language of Dhubr&#x301;i is Rangpuri Bengali. The spoken language of Coochbihar and Jalpaiguri is also Rangpuri Bengali, however in different parts of the two districts different branches of Rangpuri Bengali are prevalent.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..93"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=93 type=paragraph -->The mountainous regions in the western part of the Kingdom of Mayurbhanj were allowed to remain in the hands of the maharaja and the relatively level regions to the east were incorporated into British Bengal. The maharaja of this region became a zamindar of the British. His land revenue used to be deposited in the collectory at Midnapore. In the remaining areas he remained a native king. The capital of the kingdom was Ba&#x301;ripada&#x301;. The portion that was incorporated into British Bengal was somewhat sparsely populated at that time. There was a small jungle but no mountains to speak of. The British brought in new tenants so the region became known as Nuya&#x301;vasa&#x301;n, that is, &ldquo;where tenants have been newly installed&rdquo;. The spoken language of the western and southern parts of Mayurbhanj is northern Oriya and the spoken language of the northeast part is Kera&#x301; Bengali.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..94"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=94 type=paragraph -->This Kera&#x301; Bengali is a blending of Oriya and Bengali. Many people are aware of the fact that the Oriya and Bengali languages are extremely close neighbours. Their history is also the same to a great extent. The social functions and customs of their communities as well as their anthropological identities are nearly the same. It is impossible to completely separate the two, thus it is meaningless to work up a sweat trying to decide whether this Kera&#x301; Bengali mixture is a dialect of Bengali or a dialect of Oriya. No matter what the leaders or the philologists say, I would say that since this dialect is equally related to both Bengali and Oriya the people there can claim either Bengali or Oriya as their mother tongue as they wish. It is only natural that they should do as suits them best.<!-- /block --></p>

The Indian people have shown a certain apathy towards history since very ancient times; thus they have comparatively little written history. Stone inscriptions, copper inscriptions and coins offer very little help in assessing history, so if there is a proper and heartfelt effort to discover the history behind the names given to towns and villages then that history can be newly prepared. The greater portion of the history that is taught nowadays in the schools and colleges will then have to be mercilessly discarded.<!-- /block --></p>

<p class=footnotes_title>Footnotes</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="19.fn1"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.19.fn1">1</a></b>)  In English they also used to be called &ldquo;Hollanders&rdquo;. This &ldquo;Hollanders&rdquo; became pronounced olanda&#x301;j in Bengali.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="19.fn2"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.19.fn2">2</a></b>)  Many people mistakenly write prasa&#x301;rata&#x301;. Pra &ndash; sr + ghain&#x32D; = prasa&#x301;ra. The word is a qualitative noun. The suffix ta&#x301; [ness] cannot be added to it so the word prasa&#x301;rata&#x301; is wrong from head to toe. It is better that it not be used.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="19.fn3"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.19.fn3">3</a></b>)   In Kishanganj Subdivision there is one such place named Diighalva&#x301;nk. The name indicates what sort of a place it is. I have heard many educated gentlemen pronounce the name &ldquo;D&#x301;iga&#x301;l Bank&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="19.fn4"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.19.fn4">4</a></b>)  Genyokha&#x301;li&#146;s old name was Jiivankha&#x301;li or Ja&#x301;hnaviikha&#x301;li. It was most likely named after the queen of Mahis&#x301;a&#x301;dal, Ja&#x301;hnaviidevii. In order to save Mahis&#x301;a&#x301;dal from the Maratha navy, Ja&#x301;hnaviidevii brought a skilled Portuguese naval force from Bandel or Bonadel (in Portuguese this means &ldquo;beautiful village&rdquo;) and lodged them on her estates in the village of Mirja&#x301;pur. The successors of those Portuguese have nowadays mixed with the Bengali Christians. Arrangements were made for a marriage between a boy named Sunil Kumar and a girl named Saoda&#x301;minii.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="19.fn5"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.19.fn5">5</a></b>)  This fish was called tapasvii fish in Sanskrit because in front of its mouth it has something that looked like a beard. From this comes the Bengali tapse fish.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="19.fn6"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.19.fn6">6</a></b>)   There is some difference of opinion regarding this. According to some people an extra few hundred rupees had to be given as a landlord&#146;s fee.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="19.fn7"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.19.fn7">7</a></b>)   The modern name of Dalhousie square is B. B. D. Bag. Here also we have a distortion of history. Would it not have been better to construct something new in the name of the three heroes for which B. B. D. Bag has been named? Lord Dalhousie was a symbol of British imperialism. Still he cannot be erased from the history of India. We pronounce the word &ldquo;Dalhousie&rdquo; but its correct English pronunciation is d&#x301;a&#x301;lu&#x301;zii, as if it were spelled &ldquo;Dal-oozee&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="19.fn8"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.19.fn8">8</a></b>)  In order to facilitate boat traffic the British excavated a linking canal from the Bhagiirathii at Ba&#x301;lii village to the Saraswati River. Due to the digging of this canal, the northern part of Ba&#x301;lii was cut off from the rest of the village. Later, when Hooghly District was partitioned and a new Howrah District was created, the original Ba&#x301;lii village was included within the newly-created Howrah District and the separated Otorpa&#x301;r&#x301;a&#x301; village remained in Hooghly District.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="19.fn9"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.19.fn9">9</a></b>)  Some people mistakenly write Sha&#x301;lkiya&#x301; or Sha&#x301;lke. This marshland [ha&#x301;or&#x301;a] area was mainly known by the name of Ha&#x301;or&#x301;a&#x301; [Howrah]. There were huge banyan trees in the elevated [d&#x301;a&#x301;un&#x32D;ga&#x301;] areas of these swamps. One of these very ancient banyan trees is now in the Shivpur botanical gardens. It is probably the oldest banyan tree in India. I have mentioned probably for this reason that there is one of these same ancient banyan trees near Nadia District&#146;s Ba&#x301;gcijjamasedpur. Great numbers of sha&#x301;likh birds used to live in these banyan trees in the swamps, hence the name Sha&#x301;likha&#x301; or Sha&#x301;lkhe.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="19.fn10"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.19.fn10">10</a></b>)   The worship of Shiva on the last day of the Bengali year. &ndash; Trans.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="19.fn11"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.19.fn11">11</a></b>)  [Shivapurii &rarr; Shivaorii &rarr; Shiurii. Sa and r&#x301;a are used by mistake. Its English name is &ldquo;Suri&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="19.fn12"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.19.fn12">12</a></b>)   The colloquial meaning of ga&#x301;r&#x301;ii is &ldquo;vehicle&rdquo;. &ndash;Trans.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="19.fn13"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.19.fn13">13</a></b>)  Its Sanskrit name is va&#x301;sttuka. Very often betho sha&#x301;k grows spontaneously during the winter in potato fields. This gritty, glittering-leafed green is a favourite food of the people. Indeed, Mahaprabhu Caetanyadeva used to love to eat this green. Saciidevii fed Mahaprabhu a curry of this green in Shantipur.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="19.fn14"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.19.fn14">14</a></b>)  The real name of the city of Patna is Ba&#x301;nkipur. During the Mughal era the capital of Bihar Province was a few miles to the east in A&#x301;zima&#x301;ba&#x301;d. A&#x301;zima&#x301;ba&#x301;d&#146;s present-day name is Patna City. The city was named A&#x301;zima&#x301;ba&#x301;d after the commander-in-chief A&#x301;zim-ush-sha&#x301;n.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="19.fn15"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.19.fn15">15</a></b>)  The word patna comes from pattana which means &ldquo;settlement&rdquo; in Sanskrit. &ndash;Trans.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="19.fn16"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.19.fn16">16</a></b>)  Tapan &ndash; in west Dinajpur it is said that King Danujmardan Dev, formerly known as Divyoka, after whom Dinajpur was named, dug this diighi and used to do tarpana [ritual offering to ancestors] in its waters. The name Tapan comes from this tarpan&#x301;a.</p>

<a name="20..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The subject of today&#146;s discussion is sama&#x301;sa [compound words]. The word samasta is used extensively in Bengali. However in Bengali the meaning of the common Sanskrit-borrowed words samasta, sakala, samagra is not identical. It has been said:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..2"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Yadyapi bahuna&#x301;dhiise tatha&#x301;pi pat&#x301;ha puttra vya&#x301;karan&#x301;am;<br>Svajanah svajano ma&#x301;bhu&#x301;t sakalam&#x301; shakalam&#x301; sakrt shakrt.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->A language has many words which are pronounced practically the same but which have different meanings, and it also has words which have many different meanings. Then again, there are many words which differ slightly in spelling but greatly in meaning. If one is to learn how to use such words correctly one needs to study and acquire mastery in grammar. Otherwise one&#146;s own mistakes will be passed on to others. Thus the aforementioned verse says: &ldquo;O son [puttra], even though you have studied much, do study a little grammar.&rdquo; Incidentally I would like to mention that puttra is not spelled putra. The people of those days imagined that there was a certain hell by the name of Put. It was their conception that if one&#146;s son would do the ritual funeral offering then one would be saved from that hell. Adding the suffix d&#x301;a after the verbal root trae makes tra, that is, &ldquo;that which rescues [tra&#x301;n kara&#x301;]&rdquo; or &ldquo;one who saves&rdquo;. Put + trae + d&#x301;a = puttra. In other words, since both the words put and trae have a ta, the spelling of the word putra must retain the two ta&#146;s. Many people mistakenly spell the word putra. Similar is the case with ga&#x301;yattrii (gae + shatr = ga&#x301;yat + trae + d&#x301;a + the feminine iniip = ga&#x301;yattrii). It is also spelled with two ta&#146;s. The word pa&#x301;shca&#x301;ttya also has to be spelled with two ta&#146;s because the word is derived from pashca&#x301;t + tyaun&#x32D;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->We were discussing the necessity of learning grammar. If one knows grammar it is beneficial both at home and everywhere else. The knowledge of grammar enables a person to take their place in the society at large and to maintain good social relations with their kith and kin [a&#x301;tmiiya-svajana]. Now let us have a look at the word svajana.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Svajana means &ldquo;one&#146;s own people&rdquo;, &ldquo;kinsman&rdquo;, &ldquo;relatives&rdquo;, while shvajana means kukur [dog]; the related Sanskrit words are kukkura, sa&#x301;rameya.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.20.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#20.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> Hence if anyone writes shvajana instead of svajana out of ignorance or carelessness then it is doubtful whether their good relations with their svajana will remain. Even feeding them coconut ladus [a type of sweet] will not put that sweet relationship right again.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->The situation is similar with sakala and shakala. Kalena saha itya&#x301;rthe &ldquo;sakala&rdquo;. Kala means &ldquo;sprout&rdquo;. Sakala means &ldquo;that from which the sprout has emerged&rdquo;, in other words, that which is manifest or expressed. Everything in this universe is a manifest entity. For example, in philosophy it is called sakala brahma, that is, manifest brahma. When unmanifest it is nis&#x301;kala brahma or nirgun&#x301;a brahma. But if the word is written with sha, that is, shakala, then its meaning becomes &ldquo;piece&rdquo; or &ldquo;part&rdquo;. For example, upalasakala refers to an entire pebble while upalashakala refers to a piece of a pebble. A simple little error like this turns the meaning of the word upside down. Sakrt means &ldquo;once&rdquo;, for example, sakrt kuru &ndash; &ldquo;do it once&rdquo;. Shakrt, however, means &ldquo;feces&rdquo;; its Vedic synonyms are ucca&#x301;ra, mala, etc. The word socca&#x301;ra that even many educated people write or say nowadays to mean &ldquo;vocal&rdquo; is completely erroneous. The meaning of the word socca&#x301;ra is &ldquo;one who has defecated but who has not yet cleaned themselves&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->It is a good idea, not only with Sanskrit and Bengali grammar, but also with the different foreign words used in Bengali, to know something about how to use them. Many people use the word vadan to mean &ldquo;countenance&rdquo;. I have seen in Bengali poetry: nishidin heri tava prasanna vadan [day and night I behold your pleasing countenance]. Does the word vadan come from the Sanskrit verbal root vad and the suffix anat&#x301;? No, not at all. If it had come from the Sanskrit verbal root vad then its use would have been limited to matters connected with the vocal apparatus, that is, limited to the tongue, soft palate, and lips. It certainly would not be used for the entire face. Actually the word is Farsi and its primary meaning is &ldquo;countenance&rdquo;, that is, primarily the entire face and secondarily the entire front side of the body. If I say in Urdu vadanpar cot&#x301; la&#x301;gii hae, then it does not mean that a blow has been struck only to the lips and tongue, nor to the brow, cheek, nose, lips. In this case it means that the entire body has been injured, especially the front side. Hence it would be better not to say nishidin heri tava prasanna vadan because the face, hands, feet, shoulder are not pleasing or unpleasing.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Now the meaning of sakala and samasta are not the same. The meaning of the word sakala has already been discussed and the meaning of the word samasta is &ldquo;the united form of many&rdquo;, what is called &ldquo;collective body&rdquo; in English. The substantive form of the adjective samasta is sama&#x301;sa. Thus the meaning of the word sama&#x301;sa becomes &ldquo;the meaningful condensed form of a word cluster&rdquo;. We can also call it a &ldquo;compound word&rdquo;. For example, the word &ldquo;court&rdquo; [ra&#x301;jasabha&#x301;] in Farsi is ada&#x301;lat or kacha&#x301;rii; these have become a&#x301;da&#x301;lat and ka&#x301;cha&#x301;ri in Bengali. &ldquo;Dancer&rdquo; is narttaka. So if we want to say ra&#x301;jasabha&#x301;r narttaka in English we would say &ldquo;dancer of the court&rdquo;. Instead of using so many words we can also condense it and say &ldquo;court-dancer&rdquo;. This saves time and effort and a new compound word has also been created. The compound word in this instance is formed by combining the first word &ldquo;court&rdquo; and the second word &ldquo;dancer&rdquo;. This kind of compound word is found in practically every language of the world but only in Sanskrit and its daughter languages has the compound word-dependent sama&#x301;sa been extended grammatical acceptance. Although sama&#x301;sa exists in other languages it has not been extended full acceptance.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->The &ldquo;of&rdquo; that I have used in the phrase &ldquo;dancer of the court&rdquo; is an indeclinable. Both prepositions and conjunctions in English are indeclinables. &ldquo;The&rdquo; is the definite article. Now the definite article remains unchanged in the majority of the world&#146;s languages but there are some exceptions. For example, in French the definite article le is used for masculine gender words while la is used for feminine gender words and les for the plural. So we see that in French the definite article changes according to the gender and number of the noun. For example, &ldquo;an uncle&rdquo; in French is un oncle. With elision it becomes unoncle. On the other hand, in Urdu it is ek caca&#x301; or ek cacii [an aunt]. Bear in mind that the word caca&#x301; is Urdu but the word kaka&#x301; is Farsi. The pure Bengali word is khur&#x301;a&#x301;, khur&#x301;i.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Anyhow, the compound word &ldquo;court-dancer&rdquo; is created by removing the indeclinable &ldquo;of&rdquo; and the definite article &ldquo;the&rdquo; from the phrase &ldquo;dancer of the court&rdquo;. The English &ldquo;of&rdquo; and the Bengali ra or er are signs that denote the sixth case. Now when an indeclinable or preposition is dropped in order to form a compound word it has to be seen which indeclinable or preposition is dropped and in which case it is used. Here the indeclinable &ldquo;of&rdquo; is dropped. &ldquo;Of&rdquo; is used in the possessive case and in Bengali ra and er are used in the sambandha ka&#x301;raka [genitive case], as marks signifying the sixth case-ending. Hence the compound word, or sama&#x301;sa, which is formed by eliminating the sixth case is understood to be s&#x301;as&#x301;t&#x301;hii [sixth] tatpurus&#x301;a sama&#x301;sa. The sama&#x301;sa that is formed by dropping the case-ending of the first word is called tatpurus&#x301;a sama&#x301;sa. Thus the word &ldquo;court-dancer&rdquo; is considered to be s&#x301;as&#x301;t&#x301;hii tatpurus&#x301;a sama&#x301;sa. A similar word in English is &ldquo;courtyard&rdquo;. If we interpolate it we get &ldquo;yard of the court&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Similarly, &ldquo;expert litterateur&rdquo; signifies &ldquo;expert in literature&rdquo;. The English &ldquo;in&rdquo; is an indeclinable. In Bengali e, te and ete are used for &ldquo;in&rdquo;. These are signs which denote the seventh case. In other words, in the aforementioned example the compound word is formed by dropping the sign of the seventh case-ending &ndash; &ldquo;in&rdquo; or e. In other words, in Bengali we say sa&#x301;hityanipun&#x301;a for the English &ldquo;expert in literature&rdquo;. Hence both &ldquo;expert litterateur&rdquo; as well as sa&#x301;hityanipun&#x301;a are saptamii [seventh] tatpurus&#x301;a sama&#x301;sa. So if any compound or collective word is interpolated in this way one gets the concerning sama&#x301;sa.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Now the phrase which is created to interpolate the compound word is called the sama&#x301;sava&#x301;kya or vya&#x301;sava&#x301;kya. We should know why the name vya&#x301;sava&#x301;kya is used. In olden times when the pandits were teaching their students they used to sit on blankets or seats spread out on a wooden cot. There was a small table in front of the students. The seat on which the pandits would sit to talk about sama&#x301;sava&#x301;kya was called the vya&#x301;sa&#x301;sana. And the sama&#x301;sava&#x301;kya that used to be explained while sitting on that vya&#x301;sa&#x301;sana was called the vya&#x301;sava&#x301;kya. This vya&#x301;sava&#x301;kya exists in all the world&#146;s languages and so does sama&#x301;sa. However it is only in Sanskrit and its daughter languages that sama&#x301;sa has been given full grammatical acceptance, not in any other language.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->English is also full of sama&#x301;sa but sama&#x301;sa has not been unambiguously accepted in English grammar. Had it been, English grammar would have been even more systematic. Due to sama&#x301;sa meaning crystallizes and time is saved. It enriches language and increases its expressive power through the creation of a great number of new words. Hence, since sama&#x301;sa is found in practically all the world&#146;s developed languages, it should be given full grammatical acceptance. This denial of full acceptance to sama&#x301;sa is a grammatical weakness. Nothing in a sama&#x301;sava&#x301;kya or vya&#x301;sava&#x301;kya should be ambiguous. The more expressed the meaning is, the better. In this way one can easily determine which sama&#x301;sa it is. If it is not, if a word in the sama&#x301;sa remains implied, then it will be difficult to determine the sama&#x301;sa. Take, for example, ham&#x301;sa-dimba [swan-egg]. This compound word is not ham&#x301;ser [male swan&#146;s] dimba but rather ham&#x301;siir [female swan&#146;s] dimba because male swans do not lay eggs. So one must say ham&#x301;siir dimba. Similar is the case with cha&#x301;gadugdha [goat-milk]. Here also the sama&#x301;sava&#x301;kya is cha&#x301;giir dugdha, not cha&#x301;ger dugdha. Thus the meaning in a sama&#x301;sava&#x301;kya must be clearly expressed &ndash; implying it will not do.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->When a relationship is established between two words and one is a figurative form of the other then it is ru&#x301;paka karmadha&#x301;raya sama&#x301;sa. For example, bhasmabhu&#x301;san&#x301;a [ash-ornament] means bhasmaru&#x301;pa bhu&#x301;s&#x301;an&#x301;a [decoration in the form of ash]. Of course this is madhyapadalopii [dropping the central word] karmadha&#x301;raya, however since here bhasma [ash] is explained as a special form [ru&#x301;pa] of decoration I have called it ru&#x301;paka karmadha&#x301;raya. It would not be incorrect usage if it were called madhyapadalopii karmadha&#x301;raya, however, since ru&#x301;paka karmadha&#x301;raya is a part of madhyapadalopii karmadha&#x301;raya. Teachers should acquaint their students with ru&#x301;paka karmadha&#x301;raya and students should point out instances of ru&#x301;paka karmadha&#x301;raya in their answer papers.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Another example in English is &ldquo;mother-plant&rdquo;, which becomes &ldquo;plant serving as mother&rdquo;. Here a special relationship has been established between &ldquo;plant&rdquo; and &ldquo;mother&rdquo; and a particular importance has been ascribed to &ldquo;plant&rdquo;. &ldquo;Plant&rdquo; has been given a specific role. Similarly, in Bengali if a relationship is established between ma&#x301;ta&#x301; [mother] and taru [plant] and a sama&#x301;sa is created &ndash; ma&#x301;trru&#x301;pa&#x301; taru &ndash; then a special role is ascribed to taru; that is, taru is considered to be a mother according to this special role. Since it takes a special form, that is, the form of a mother, its vya&#x301;sava&#x301;kya will be ma&#x301;trru&#x301;pa taru, that is, ru&#x301;paka karmadha&#x301;raya sama&#x301;sa.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Taru in the role of mother does not imply respect or praise.

It becomes a different sama&#x301;sa. Take, for example, ra&#x301;jasim&#x301;ha. Here a special relationship is established between the words ra&#x301;ja [king] and sim&#x301;ha [lion] but no specific role has been given to either word. In other words, rather than being ra&#x301;ja&#x301; ru&#x301;pa sim&#x301;ha it is ra&#x301;ja&#x301; sim&#x301;her mata or ra&#x301;ja&#x301; sim&#x301;her nya&#x301;ya [king like a lion]. Here a comparison is drawn between the two words and the sama&#x301;sa produced by that comparison is upamita sama&#x301;sa because the king has been compared [upamita] to a lion. We should point out here that while the word ru&#x301;pa in ru&#x301;paka karmadha&#x301;raya sama&#x301;sa occurs in the middle of the vya&#x301;sava&#x301;kya, mata or nya&#x301;ya in upamita karmadha&#x301;raya can be either in the middle or at the end of the vya&#x301;sava&#x301;kya, although it is generally at the end.<!-- /block --></p>

However in the case of sim&#x301;hava&#x301;hu the object to which it is being compared is the first word, that is, the situation is reversed. A similar example is gajer gamaner nya&#x301;ya gamana [movement like an elephant&#146;s]. Here the gamana in the following position has been compared to the gamana [movement] of an elephant. Hence it is upama&#x301;na sama&#x301;sa. An English example is &ldquo;crystal-clear&rdquo;, that is, &ldquo;as clear as crystal&rdquo;.

In this sama&#x301;sa the seventh case-ending mark e has been dropped making it saptamii [seventh] tatpurus&#x301;a suma&#x301;sa. When an Englishman approaches England in a ship and recognizes its familiar climate and environment he knows it is his home-climate. The meaning of this &ldquo;home-climate&rdquo; is &ldquo;climate of home&rdquo;. It has been compounded into one word. The sama&#x301;sa is formed by dropping the English indeclinable &ldquo;of&rdquo; so this is tatpurus&#x301;a sama&#x301;sa, true enough. However, in the case of compounds where a specific person or thing is brought in to express the adjective of the tatpurus&#x301;a sama&#x301;sa in a special way then it is called upapada sama&#x301;sa.

A similar non-compound expression is juto sela&#x301;i theke can&#x301;d&#x301;iipa&#x301;t&#x301;h [from sewing shoes to reading the Chandi]. If we wish we can say it as a compound word &ndash; a&#x301;ma&#x301;ke juto sela&#x301;i-can&#x301;d&#x301;iipa&#x301;t&#x301;h karte hay. Here the phrase is not juto sela&#x301;i and can&#x301;d&#x301;iipa&#x301;th. It is juto selai theke can&#x301;d&#x301;iipa&#x301;th paryanta chot&#x301;a bar&#x301;a sab ka&#x301;j kare jete hay [all large and small work has to be done from the sewing of shoes to the reading of the Chandi].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->Similarly, we use avyayiibha&#x301;va sama&#x301;sa in Sanskrit. For example, a&#x301;pa&#x301;damastaka, which means &ldquo;from foot to head&rdquo;, is also avyayiibha&#x301;va. One thing has to be kept in mind if we are to determine avyayiibha&#x301;va sama&#x301;sa. Not all Sanskrit indeclinables are indeclinables in Bengali. These kinds of Sanskrit indeclinables (but non-indeclinables in Bengali) can be avyayiibha&#x301;va in Sanskrit but not in Bengali, for example, pra&#x301;tarbhraman&#x301;a [morning-journey]. In Sanskrit this is avyayiibha&#x301;va but in Bengali it is s&#x301;as&#x301;t&#x301;hii tatpurus&#x301;a and madhyapadalopii karmadha&#x301;raya. The phrase pra&#x301;ter bhraman&#x301; is s&#x301;as&#x301;t&#x301;hii tatpurus&#x301;a and the phrase pra&#x301;tahka&#x301;liin bhraman&#x301; is madhyapadalopii karmadha&#x301;raya. The word pra&#x301;tah [early morning] is an indeclinable in Sanskrit. It does not take any case-ending so it cannot be tatpurus&#x301;a in Sanskrit. In Sanskrit it is avyayiibha&#x301;va or madhyapadalopii karmadha&#x301;raya while in Bengali it is s&#x301;as&#x301;t&#x301;hii tatpurs&#x301;a or madhyapadalopii karmadha&#x301;raya, not avyayiibha&#x301;va. Pra&#x301;tah means the same thing in Bengali as it does in Sanskrit, but while it is an indeclinable in Sanskrit it is a non-indeclinable in Bengali.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->A Sanskrit synonym for pra&#x301;tah is kalyam, that is, the early morning of the next day &ndash; not the entire day. It is from sunrise until forty-five minutes afterwards &ndash; pratyus&#x301;e bhavet kalyam. The proper Bengali synonyms for kalyam are bhor, viha&#x301;n, etc. The Sanskrit for what we call ka&#x301;l in Bengali &ndash; &ldquo;tomorrow in English&rdquo; &ndash; is shvah (the word shvah also means &ldquo;dog&rdquo;). The &ldquo;day-after-tomorrow&rdquo; in Sanskrit is parashva (parshu in Bengali). Some people take a fancy to writing parshu parsu. No, it cannot be spelled with su, only with shu. Those who fancy it should restrain their fancy. This kind of whimsical use of spelling upsets languages.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->In English when two events take place in the past then the first becomes past perfect and the second becomes past indicative. Take, for example, &ldquo;the doctor arrived&rdquo; and &ldquo;the patient died&rdquo;. Now if the death of the patient happened before the arrival of the doctor then in English one says: &ldquo;The patient had died before the doctor arrived.&rdquo; Similarly, in Sanskrit if two actions of a particular entity take place serially then the adjective for the first is placed first and the adjective for the second follows. The sama&#x301;sa that is created in this way is called supsupeti sama&#x301;sa, for example, agre supta pashca&#x301;t utthita (agre supta pashca&#x301;dutthitah). This supsupeti sama&#x301;sa is classified under karmadha&#x301;raya.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->Now let us come to the subject of dvandva sama&#x301;sa. Dvandva is a collective of two or more unequal words. When these two or more words are placed side by side one of them changes. There is no need to use the Sanskrit conjunctions o, ka, or ca. A new compound word is created, for example, giri and sindhu. By putting these two dissimilar words together a compound word is created &ndash; girisindhu. One thing to bear in mind here is that many people often use the word evam&#x301; instead of the conjunction o [and]. However evam&#x301; does not mean o, nor is evam&#x301; a Bengali word. It is a Sanskrit word which means &ldquo;in this way&rdquo;. For example, evam&#x301; kuru means &ldquo;do it like this&rdquo;. Hence evam&#x301; will not work in place of o in the vya&#x301;sava&#x301;kya of dvandva sama&#x301;sa. In the spoken Bengali of the village areas the word a&#x301;r is used, not evam&#x301;, for example, baoma&#x301;, ca&#x301;l a&#x301;r d&#x301;a&#x301;l niye eso [daughter-in-law, bring rice and d&#x301;a&#x301;l].

<a name="20..32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->One speciality of dvandva sama&#x301;sa is that if two proper nouns ending in a are put together then the ending of the first word of the compound word changes to ii, for example, kusha and lava = kushiilava. In ancient India it was the practice in Sanskrit drama that two small boys would come on stage and one would announce the names of the characters in the drama while the other would announce [ghos&#x301;an&#x301;a] the names of the actors and actresses playing them.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.20.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#20.fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> Those who used to make the announcements were called kushiilava.

A great snow [him], that is, snowfall extending a great distance, is called hima&#x301;nii. A great forest [aran&#x301;ya], that is, a forest that extends a great distance, we would call aran&#x301;ya&#x301;nii. But we would not call a great yavana a yavana&#x301;nii. The script with which the yavanas write is called Yavana&#x301;nii. However, bear in mind that a great vana [forest] is not called vana&#x301;nii. There is no such word as vana&#x301;nii.

<a name="20..40"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=40 type=paragraph -->As the story goes, when Ram was completely unable to defeat the powerful Ravana, who had Shiva&#146;s power, during their fierce battle, he performed a worship of Shiva in the hopes of pleasing him. In the mantra of obeisance at the end of the worship Ram used the name Ra&#x301;meshva&#x301;ra for Shiva. He said: Tvam&#x301; Ra&#x301;masya iishvarah itya&#x301;rthe Ra&#x301;meshvarah &ndash; (s&#x301;as&#x301;t&#x301;hii tat) [You are Ram&#146;s Lord; in that sense you are Ra&#x301;meshvara].

Ra&#x301;mah yasya iishvarah sah Ra&#x301;meshvarah&rdquo; &ndash; (bahuvriihi sama&#x301;sa). That is, Ram is Ra&#x301;meshvara to those for whom he is Lord. In other words, &ldquo;I think of Ram as my Lord.&rdquo; Ram said: &ldquo;How can I be Shiva&#146;s Lord?&rdquo; This set off a verbal dispute between the two. Probably the sound of weapons also started ringing out, one with the bow and arrow and the other with the trident. The sea-girt earth trembled. Groups of men and bears and monkeys started shaking violently out of fear. Everyone became afraid and wondered: &ldquo;What is going on, what is going on! What cataclysm has befallen us!&rdquo; With folded palms they entreated them: &ldquo;You are both great souls. We don&#146;t want there to be a war between you.&rdquo; The two of them said: &ldquo;We are also keen to avoid war. Tell us what sama&#x301;sa it will be and everything will be finished.&rdquo; Then they all replied in one voice: &ldquo;What need is there for a quarrel over who is whose Lord? Ra&#x301;maeva iishvarah iti Ra&#x301;meshvarah &ndash; nitya sama&#x301;sa (Ram is the Lord, in this sense Ra&#x301;meshvara &ndash; nitya sama&#x301;sa).&rdquo; Everyone accepted that Ram was God. It is best not to debate over who is whose Lord. This is nitya sama&#x301;sa.<!-- /block --></p>

<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="20.fn1"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.20.fn1">1</a></b>)  In the Puranic imagination there is a hell where the god of death, Yamaraj&#146;s gate is guarded by sentries. Chief among them is a female dog whose name is Sarama&#x301;. The word sa&#x301;rameya is derived by adding the suffix s&#x301;n&#x301;eya in apatya&#x301;rtha to the root word sarama&#x301; in tadhita&#x301;rtha; it means &ldquo;progeny of Sarama&#x301;&rdquo; or &ldquo;progeny of a female dog&rdquo;. Be careful that no one names their daughter &ldquo;Sarama&#x301;&rdquo;. Of course Vibhiis&#x301;an&#x301;a&#146;s wife in the Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a was named Sarama&#x301; but that Sarama&#x301; was not human. She was a female demon.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="20.fn2"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.20.fn2">2</a></b>)  When some portion of three different lunar days fall within the course of one solar day. &ndash;Trans.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="20.fn3"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.20.fn3">3</a></b>)   Incidentally, when someone injudiciously says something erroneous we often say lokt&#x301;a&#x301; beka&#x301;yda&#x301;y par&#x301;e bebhul bakche [The fellow has gotten himself into an inconvenient position and is prattling on]. In this case the word bebhul is incorrect. However if someone says bebhul it is okay.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="20.fn4"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.20.fn4">4</a></b>)  Many people use the word ullekha to mean ghos&#x301;an&#x301;a. Bear in mind, ut + lekha = ullekha, that is, informing about what is written. If it is oral then the word ullekha is not used.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="20.fn5"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.20.fn5">5</a></b>)   Yavana means &ldquo;foreign&rdquo; &ndash; those who do not follow the Indo-Aryan culture. This is not an insult. Male yavanas are called yavana and their wives are called yavanii. Their daughters are yavanika&#x301; or yavana&#x301; and their written script is called Yavana&#x301;nii &ndash; yavana&#x301;na&#x301;m&#x301; lipih itya&#x301;rthe yavana&#x301;nii [yavana&#x301;nii means &ldquo;the script of the yavanas&rdquo;].</p>

<a name="21..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The subject of today&#146;s discussion is derivation, emanation and distortion. Sound is the subtlest of the five inferences &ndash; sound, touch, form, taste and smell. In the New Testament it is said: &ldquo;In the beginning was the word.&rdquo; In the Veda it is also said &ndash; shabdabrahma. Pran&#x301;ava&#x301;tmakam&#x301; brahma. In the distant past people imitated the different sounds they heard, and with their help they tried to express the ideas that arose in their minds. They expressed certain ideas with the help of sounds that they had discovered which maintained parallelism with those ideas. In the beginning this expression was limited to verbal roots. Gradually they created various words by adding prefixes before these verbal roots and suffixes after them. Verbs are used as verbal nouns and adverbs even in those languages which do not have a developed grammar, for example, Ra&#x301;m caeche [Ram is going]. This is verbal language. From this people have created Ra&#x301;m cal raha&#x301; hae [Ram is going &ndash; Hindi] or Ra&#x301;m calii rahal-a che. I have heard people in the Himalayan mountain regions say Ra&#x301;m calu dasha&#x301;. It is clear that the original verb form changes and is used as substantives and modifiers.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->This expression created from external sounds changes with the changes in time, place and person. In other words, linguistic distortion is dependent upon temporal, spatial and personal changes. Now let us see how linguistic distortion occurs as a result of these changes.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->An uneducated person does not speak in the same way that an educated person does with their refined language. For example, an educated person says cikitsa&#x301; [medical treatment], mahotsav [great festival], etc., but an uneducated person will say cikiccha&#x301;, mocchav, and so on. Practical experience shows that in areas with greater numbers of educated people the use of their refined language influences the colloquial language. The reverse is also true. In areas with a greater proportion of uneducated people, the colloquial language of the many also influences the educated language of the few. Thus the mocchav of the common people&#146;s language also becomes part of the spoken language of the educated people. At one time there was a greater number of educated Brahman scholars in Vikrampur Pargana and the nearby Mymensing and Tripura districts. Hence there was a much greater use of Sanskrit-borrowed words in the spoken language of the people there. I have even heard little-educated women there call dai [curd] dadhi.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->While the people of Calcutta say ba&#x301;bu kort&#x301;e sa&#x301;ks&#x301;yi dite gechen [Our boss has gone to testify in court], I have heard the people of Vikrampur say sa&#x301;ks&#x301;ya instead. While listening to the conversations of the educated pandits the common people get influenced and this increases the use of these kinds of Sanskrit words. The Pra&#x301;krta ajja comes from the Sanskrit adya. From this comes the Demi-Pra&#x301;krta a&#x301;jja; the old Bengali a&#x301;ji; the medieval Bengali a&#x301;ji, a&#x301;ij; and the modern Bengali a&#x301;j. In medieval Maethilii it was also a&#x301;ji, a&#x301;ij, and in modern Maethilii a&#x301;ij or a&#x301;i. I have seen this word adya, which has undergone so much distortion, used both in writing and in speaking in certain highly educated areas of Chittagong District.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Language becomes distorted by keeping pace with the changes in time. It should be pointed out that this distortion occurs according to the changes in pronunciation among the uneducated and little-educated people.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.21.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#21.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> Subsequently, if this distortion does not deviate much from the original language, that is, if there is only a slight distortion, then we do not assign any new name to this distorted form of the language. However when, with the passage of time, the distorted form of the language becomes far removed from the original form then we give it a new name. In other words, it is newly titled or named. For example, if we say ahammi garaham jaccha&#x301;mi for aham&#x301; grham&#x301; gaccha&#x301;mi [I go home] then we do not consider it a form of a new language. We call it a pra&#x301;krta form of Sanskrit. If we go one stage further and say ahammi garahe jaccha&#x301;i then we say that it is a Demi-Pra&#x301;krta form of Sanskrit in an effort to maintain contact with Sanskrit. However if we then say a&#x301;hmi gharae ja&#x301;cchai then we no longer entitle it Sanskrit &ndash; it is an old form of Bengali. We do not say that it is a distorted form of Sanskrit although actually it is a distorted form of Sanskrit. In the following stage, when we say a&#x301;mi ghare (gharke) ja&#x301;cchi, then we say: &ldquo;This is my mother tongue, Bengali. I don&#146;t know Sanskrit-Panskrit, nor do I understand it either. I don&#146;t have anything to do with that language. It is the language of the Brahman pandits.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Now let us return to the topic. What is derivation? Earlier we said that people created many new words by adding prefixes before the original verbs and suffixes after them. The verbal root of the word &ldquo;derivation&rdquo; is &ldquo;rive&rdquo;. The prefix &ldquo;de&rdquo; is added to this &ldquo;rive&rdquo;; that is, it ultimately becomes &ldquo;de &ndash; rivate + ion&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Sound arises from nature. Human beings try to express in a manner similar to the sounds they hear and through which they get ideas. For example, woodpeckers do t&#x301;hak t&#x301;hak [sound of striking wood] when they rap wood. People do not like it when this sound strikes their ears and they express this unpleasant feeling through the medium of the word t&#x301;hak t&#x301;hak. When household utensils or pots and pans fall down they create a jhanjhan sound. The word jhanjhan expresses this idea. Similarly, if something breaks it makes a mar&#x301;mar&#x301; sound. One does not like it so the expression of this feeling of dislike takes place through the word jhanjhan. The wife of a certain gentleman that I knew was quite ill-mannered. One winter evening I saw this gentleman sitting quietly at the foot of a tree. I asked him: &ldquo;Why are you sitting under this tree on a winter evening? You&#146;ll freeze.&rdquo; He replied: &ldquo;You know, my young friend, if I go in the house I&#146;ll hear only khankhan jhanhan. It&#146;s a lot more peaceful out here.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

This process of word formation is called &ldquo;acoustic derivation&rdquo; and the original verbal roots in all the world&#146;s languages were created in this way.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->The first word forms in all the world&#146;s languages were the original verbal roots. By adding prefixes and suffixes many different words were derived. Among the established languages of the world, mainly four can be considered as the root languages. They are Vedic, Latin, Hebrew and old Chinese. If one examines the derivation of the vocabulary of these languages one will find that their method or process is identical. Only Vedic among these four did not have a grammar because it was a dynamic, living language. At the time when it was a spoken language people had not yet been able to invent written script. A living language never remains bound by the hard and fast rules and fetters of grammar. It should be mentioned here that grammar derives its form from the special characteristics of a language. A language does not depend on grammar to function.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->The journey of the Vedic language began approximately fifteen thousand years ago and it attained its full development about ten thousand years ago. In other words, it walked its road for about five thousand years. In very ancient times the pace of language was very slow so Vedic needed five thousand years of dedicated vocal effort to attain its maturity. This five thousand year period is not short in terms of linguistic distortion [evolution to a new language]. A language normally lasts about one thousand years. Hence in modern times five new languages could have evolved in this five thousand years. Still, by examining the different man&#x301;d&#x301;alas [chapters] of the Vedas I have seen that the language of the oldest part is not the same as that of the last part. In other words, although it goes by the same name, Vedic, with the passage of time it became noticeably different.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->As an example, let us take the Bengali language. The old form of Bengali took birth about twelve hundred years ago or a little before that. The old Bengali language lasted up until about eight hundred years ago. You could say that it lasted much less than one thousand years, but this is not the case. When we say that old Bengali was created about twelve hundred years ago it has to be understood that old Bengali literature dates back to at least twelve hundred years ago. Old Bengali certainly evolved some time before that, although we do not have any examples of it in our hands.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->We take the oldest time of the Vedic language to be approximately fifteen thousand years ago, but is this to say that the people did not have a language before then? Of course they did. Mankind appeared on this planet approximately one million years ago. So when human beings appeared on earth they certainly brought language with them. The newborn children of those days certainly learned language from their mothers. We do not, however, have in our hands any examples of the language that existed up until fifteen thousand years ago because the Vedas had not yet been created. And since the Vedas had not been created there was no reason to commit that language to memory in the service of spirituality. But while it is true that the people did not commit that pre-Vedic era language to memory for spiritual purposes, did this mean that they did not have an oral tradition of folk songs, doggerels and lullabies? I would guess that they did and that that language was certainly passed on orally. However since there was no strong motivation for committing it to memory, they abandoned the folk songs, doggerels, lullabies, etc. of the old language when it became transformed through natural linguistic distortion and composed new unwritten songs and doggerels in the new language. In Bengali also, none of the songs and doggerels commonly sung by the people are more than seven or eight hundred years old. The old language has become incomprehensible nowadays so the women-folk had stopped, have stopped and are stopping singing them.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->Indeed, why go back so far!

<a name="21..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->Not only folk songs, doggerels and lullabies, but all types of literature only survive if they possess a richness of idea or feeling. People kept the Vedic language alive orally because it had this imaginative richness. Although Vedic had attained maturity, it did not have a written form because the alphabet or written script had not yet been invented. Old Vedic&#146;s only oral book was the Veda. It has survived till today because it had some relationship with dharma, however what is understood by &ldquo;dharma&rdquo; now and what was understood by it during the Vedic era is not exactly the same thing. The intellectuals of those days used to express their realizations for the welfare of the people (although they were not literate they were certainly intellectuals in terms of erudition and wealth of imagination). These intellectuals used to be known as rs&#x301;i during the Vedic era. Rs&#x301;i means &ldquo;cultured person&rdquo;. The word rs&#x301;i comes from the verbal root r. For this reason those who accepted the Vedic doctrine in those days used to call themselves followers of the Vedic or A&#x301;rs&#x301;a doctrine (the word a&#x301;rs&#x301;a comes from the word rs&#x301;i).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->Clearly, the word &ldquo;Hindu&rdquo; did not exist during that era. Hindu is a Farsi word whose fundamental meaning is &ldquo;Indus River-basin&rdquo; or the community of people living in the nearby areas. All of them, regardless of what religion they followed, were Hindus. In other words, the word hindu is a completely geographical word. Those whom we call &ldquo;Hindu&rdquo; today are indeed Hindus in the geographical sense. In terms of religion they are followers of the A&#x301;rs&#x301;a doctrine. However since nowadays the word &ldquo;Hindu&rdquo; is used instead of &ldquo;A&#x301;rs&#x301;a&rdquo; those who are called Hindu today are Hindus both in the geographical sense and in the religious sense. But those who belong to the various other so-called sects in India are Hindus in the geographical sense but not in the religious sense. They have their own religions.<!-- /block --></p>

Many of the rules of Latin are similar to those of Vedic. Many verbal roots have found a place in Latin; the prefixes and suffixes are also in accordance with Vedic. This close relationship between the two languages is especially noticeable when it comes to their vocabularies. Latin&#146;s style of pronunciation is also not far removed from Vedic. Hence if a Vedic vocabulary list is added to Latin a new dictionary will be created. For example, we are familiar with the Latin adjectives of the words frater, mater and pater such as &ldquo;fraternity&rdquo;, &ldquo;maternity&rdquo;, &ldquo;paternity&rdquo;, and so forth.

With the appearance of European civilization they came in contact with papyrus. There are a good number of Latin manuscripts written on papyrus scattered about in different places in modern-day Europe and Central Asia. The Catholic church service used to be held exclusively in Latin. At the beginning it was written on papyrus leaves. Even the English word &ldquo;paper&rdquo; comes from the word pa&#x301;-pira&#x301;s. The pronunciation of &ldquo;papyrus&rdquo; is pa&#x301;-pira&#x301;s. The correct pronunciation of &ldquo;paper&rdquo; is pepa&#x301;r. If paper is read over and over again its meaning becomes &ldquo;pepper&rdquo; (its pronunciation will be pep-a&#x301;r).

Examples of the Bra&#x301;hmii script written on sheepskins and goatskins are still discovered from time to time in the caves of central Asia (the Sanskrit language was first written in this script). It can be inferred from this that for some time after the discovery of written script many people, albeit not all, were still cave-dwellers. Even today there are a few literate people of India and the central orient that live in caves. Thus it is not inconceivable that writings might be found in their caves on birch leaves or palm leaves (ta&#x301;lpatra &ndash; the proper Sanskrit pronunciation is ta&#x301;lrapatra) or on modern paper.<!-- /block --></p>

The crown jewel of this Semitic land was the Hebrew language. In subsequent times Hebrew divided into two branches. One was medieval Hebrew and the other was old Arabic. We do not, however, have a modern Hebrew language developed from medieval Hebrew because for certain reasons those whose mother tongue was medieval Hebrew abandoned their homeland and scattered to various parts of the globe. Due to this, their original mother tongue disappeared. Those ancestors of theirs who returned to this Semitic land have resuscitated medieval Hebrew and put it to use in their everyday activities. They have also brought back to life the Semitic script of that era. In addition, they have made significant strides towards the creation of a new literature. I was very happy to see these efforts to create a new literature when I was in Israel.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->They are using the old Hebrew script. As with the language, the script is also Semitic. Arabic and Hebrew scripts belong to the same family, just as the two languages do. Moreover, the old Greek script and the ancient Roman script used to be used for Latin, which is indicative of the connection between them. One of the differences is that the old Greek and old Roman scripts are read from left to right and the Semitic scripts are read from right to left. There is also a similarity in the names of the letters. One says a&#x301;liph and another says alpha. One says be and another says beta. Arabic script has diphthongs. In this system the diphthongs are written by joining the head of one letter to the tail of the other. Although this system remained in old Roman script it is not found in modern Roman script.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..36"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph -->So I was talking about the Arabic language. Arabic is a moderately developed language. Nowadays several states, especially Iraq and Egypt, are making full-fledged attempts to create a new Arabic literature. In Egypt one sees the clear influence of French literature over Arabic literature. Egypt was under French influence for quite some time. After that the British influence increased and as a result it benefited from the literature-building work of both English and French. Although Iraq did not get this opportunity it is moving ahead rapidly.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..37"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=37 type=paragraph -->Farsi is written nowadays in a changed and expanded version of Arabic script. In other words, it has increased the number of letters according to its needs. Old Farsi, however, was not written in Arabic script. This has only taken place in the last one thousand years. Prior to that Farsi was written in the Bra&#x301;hmii and Kharos&#x301;t&#x301;hii scripts. Farsi is not a Semitic language. It is an Aryan language and a distorted form of the southern branch of Vedic. Some of the Indian languages belong to Vedic&#146;s southeastern branch and distortion just as Latin is Vedic&#146;s western branch and distortion. Medieval Farsi was a developed language and its literature achieved significant development. While modern Farsi literature has also moved forward on the path of development its speed is comparatively less than that of medieval Farsi.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..38"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=38 type=paragraph -->There is some Negro influence and some Aryan influence in the Semitic countries but Vedic influence is negligible though it cannot be altogether discounted. The Old Testament was first written in Hebrew. Later it was translated into Latin.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..39"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=39 type=paragraph -->Chinese pictorial script is quite ancient. When I was in China I saw a five thousand year-old cave painting in the government museum there. There is quite a bit of difference between the pictorial script in use in China today and the ancient pictorial script. Those cave pictures are the forefathers of the modern Chinese pictorial script; that is, those cave pictures developed into the modern Chinese script. The speciality of the Chinese script is that ideas are depicted in the lines of a drawing and these drawings are arranged as needed. If written records are taken as the measuring-rod of ascertaining the age of a civilization then the Chinese civilization is the oldest. Its civilization is nearly six thousand years old. However the Vedic civilization is older still. The Vedic civilization began around fifteen thousand years ago but its written records date back only five thousand years. As with the Vedic, Hebrew and Arabic languages, the determination of the derivation of the Chinese language&#146;s vocabulary presents no great difficulty. Still in this regard Chinese follows a special rule, a systaltic order.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..40"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=40 type=paragraph -->In all languages the joining together of prefixes, root verbs and suffixes affords an opportunity for the determination of the derivation of words. For example, to signify ja&#x301; cale caleche [that which has been moving] the suffix kvip is added to the verbal root gam to make jagat &ndash; one whose nature is movement. If the suffix s&#x301;n&#x301;ik is added to the word jagat it makes ja&#x301;gatika [pertaining to the world]. If the suffix ta&#x301; is added to that in taddhita&#x301;rtha then it makes ja&#x301;gatikata&#x301; [worldliness]. This subject will be discussed in greater depth later on.<!-- /block --></p>

<p class=footnotes_title>Footnotes</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="21.fn1"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.21.fn1">1</a></b>)  The word pra&#x301;krta is used for those whom we call pra&#x301;krta janagan&#x301;, or janasa&#x301;dha&#x301;ran&#x301;a in Sanskrit or ma&#x301;ss (masse). It is also customarily written &ldquo;masse&rdquo; in English. If the final &ldquo;e&rdquo; is not written in French then the pronunciation changes. So the Pra&#x301;krta language means &ldquo;that which is not the language of the educated or erudite people, but rather exclusively the colloquial language of the masses&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="21.fn2"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.21.fn2">2</a></b>)  It comes from the Sanskrit word sphot&#x301;a or sphut&#x301;ana. Pa&#x301;ncphor&#x301;an [seasonings] comes from pain&#x32D;casphut&#x301;ana.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="21.fn3"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.21.fn3">3</a></b>)  There is a collection of papyrus leaves in the author&#146;s museum with line drawings and ancient script. Those who are eager to see them are welcome to do so.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="21.fn4"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.21.fn4">4</a></b>)  Mishra means &ldquo;mixed&rdquo; in Sanskrit. Desha means &ldquo;country&rdquo;. &ndash; Trans.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="21.fn5"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.21.fn5">5</a></b>)  Gaja&#x301;, however, is a Sanskrit-derived word. The original word is go-jihva&#x301;, that is, &ldquo;long like a cow&#146;s tongue&rdquo;. In Bengali we say jive gaja&#x301; [jiva means &ldquo;tongue&rdquo;] however that is a redundancy because gaja&#x301; means &ldquo;like a tongue&rdquo;. So if we say jive gaja&#x301; it means &ldquo;that which is like a tongue which is like a cow&#146;s tongue&rdquo;.</p>

<a name="22..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The subject of today&#146;s discussion is &ldquo;emanation&rdquo;. In Bengali it means utsa&#x301;ran&#x301;a. If something is produced from something and gradually moves forward towards greater manifestation it is called utsa&#x301;ran&#x301;a. At the root of emanation is cause or causal factor, which is in a dormant condition at the outset. We know that the sprout comes from the seed. The potential for vastness or extensiveness lies in a dormant condition within the seed. Under favourable conditions the sprout first comes forth and thereafter it flows on the path of emanation, gradually moving forward on the path of diffusion. All of this gets its expression from the seed, from the seed-form, from the fundamental or rudimental condition. Of course, there is a fundamental difference between the two words &ldquo;rudimental&rdquo; and &ldquo;fundamental&rdquo;. &ldquo;Fundamental&rdquo; means &ldquo;pertaining to the foundation&rdquo; and &ldquo;rudimental&rdquo; means &ldquo;radical&rdquo; or &ldquo;pertaining to the seed&rdquo;. They are both Latin words. One comes directly from Latin and the other comes indirectly through the medium of old German, as has the word &ldquo;noumenal&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->This sprouting &ndash; that is, this movement from the unmanifest to the manifest state &ndash; is vyaktiikaran&#x301;a [manifestation] or utsa&#x301;ran&#x301;a. Incidentally I should point out here that the word vyaktiikaran&#x301;a is spelt with ii because if the latter word in a compound word ends with anat&#x301; or kta and the first word ends with a then ii is inserted at the end of the first word. For example, bhasma + bhu&#x301;ta = bhasmiibhu&#x301;ta; ghana + bhu&#x301;ta = ghaniibhu&#x301;ta; nava + karan&#x301;a = naviikaran&#x301;a, and so on.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->This manifestation or emanation is vibrational, and this vibration moves in a contractive-expansive flow, a systaltic order which moves in crests and troughs. For example, the flow of river-water is not straight and continuous; it moves in waves of crest and trough. The wave impulse that is present in the first phase of emanation wanes in the subsequent phase due to the different blows and counterblows. It is similar to a river which flows swiftly in the mountains but which slows down considerably when it passes through the plains and reaches the delta before finally merging in the sea.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->This rule is equally applicable to language. Language also changes in the process of maintaining adjustment with the changes in time, place and person, and this change is irresistible. It cannot be held in check. For example, Glowing Chester &rarr; Glow-Chester &rarr; Glouchester &rarr; Gloucester. The insect that we call jona&#x301;ki poka&#x301; in Bengali is called &ldquo;glow-worm&rdquo; or &ldquo;fire-worm&rdquo; in English. In Sanskrit it is called khadyot, while in Urdu it is called jugnu, and bhagjogni in the languages of Bihar. Normally these insects live in low-lying wet areas. In one low-lying area in England there were a great number of glow-worms so the people began calling the place Glowing-Chester; through distortion the modern name became Glas&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301;r although it is still spelled &ldquo;Gloucester&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Similarly, from the word &ldquo;house-wife&rdquo; comes ha&#x301;uzif and from that comes ha&#x301;zif (pronounced like &ldquo;huzif&rdquo; in English). This ha&#x301;zif means &ldquo;where odds and ends are kept&rdquo;. However when it means &ldquo;mistress of the house&rdquo; then it is pronounced ha&#x301;uz-wa&#x301;if although the spelling is the same. The modern pronunciation of ed&#x301;inbara&#x301; comes from ed&#x301;inba&#x301;rg (Edinburgh) although the English spelling remains as it was. Distortion has taken place in the Scottish pronunciation. The English for &ldquo;the price of this thing is six pennies&rdquo; is &ldquo;it is six pennies worth&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;six pennies worth&rdquo; &rarr; &ldquo;six pen-worth&rdquo;. There are many such examples in Bengali. For example, the word keleun&#x32D;ka&#x301;rii [scandal] in Bengali comes from kalaun&#x32D;kaka&#x301;rii, ga&#x301;mcha&#x301; [towel] from ga&#x301;-mocha&#x301;, ya&#x301;ccheta&#x301;i [whatever one pleases] from ya&#x301;-icche-ta&#x301;i, ebla&#x301; [this part of the day] from e-bela&#x301;, obla&#x301; from o-bela&#x301; [that part of the day], rovva&#x301;r [Sunday] from raviva&#x301;r, ta&#x301;lbelim [student] from ta&#x301;lib-e-ilm.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Another well-known word of this kind in Bengali is eyo [woman whose husband is alive]. Its origin is the Sanskrit word avidhava&#x301;. Avidhava&#x301; in Sanskrit &rarr; avihava&#x301; in Pra&#x301;krta &rarr; aihaa&#x301; in Demi-Pra&#x301;krta &rarr; a&#x301;iha in old Bengali &rarr; eyo in modern Bengali. Vidhava&#x301; [widow] women are not eyo. The word dhava has three meanings. The first is &ldquo;cloth&rdquo;, the second is &ldquo;white&rdquo; and the third is &ldquo;husband&rdquo;. One who has a husband is sadhava&#x301; and one whose husband is dead is vidhava&#x301;. An unmarried daughter is adhava&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Anyhow there is no scope for cessation in the change that language undergoes on the path of emanation. So from dadhi comes dahi &rarr; dai [curd] (dae is incorrect); vadhu&#x301; &rarr; vahu &rarr; vau [wife] (vao is incorrect); madhu &rarr; mahu &rarr; mau [honey] (mao is incorrect); sa&#x301;dhu [honest] &rarr; sa&#x301;hu &rarr; sa&#x301;u [merchant]. In ancient India there was a custom for merchants to use the title &ldquo;Sa&#x301;dhu&rdquo; [honest] at the end of their name. This was done to keep them on the honest path and to keep the tendency to stay on the honest path awake in their minds, despite the fact that they were involved in business activities. The modern word sa&#x301;u comes from the word sa&#x301;dhu.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->From the Sanskrit word ga&#x301;tramoks&#x301;an&#x301;a comes ga&#x301;tramocchana &rarr; ga&#x301;-mocha&#x301; &rarr; ga&#x301;mcha&#x301; [towel].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->A well-known Bengali word is a&#x301;lgoch. The origin of this word is the Sanskrit word alagnasparsha. Alagnasparsha &rarr; alaggapaccha &rarr; alggaccha &rarr; a&#x301;lga&#x301;chonya&#x301; &rarr; a&#x301;lgoch, that is, &ldquo;non-continuous touching&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->We often say ya&#x301;ccheta&#x301;i-ya&#x301;ccheta&#x301;i, vitikicchiri-vitikicchiri. Actually there is no such word as ya&#x301;ccheta&#x301;i. The word is ya&#x301;-icche-ta&#x301;i, that is, &ldquo;that which is not bound by rules&rdquo; or &ldquo;according to one&#146;s fancy or liking&rdquo;. The word vitikicchiri [ugly] has two equally applicable sources. One is vigatashrii &rarr; vigatachiri &rarr; vitikicchiri. The other is vigatakutsa &rarr; vigatakicchi &rarr; vitikicchiri. Shrii [charm] is called chiri in spoken Bengali. A&#x301;ha&#x301;! Katha&#x301;r kii chiri dekha na&#x301;! [Alas! Just see how charming his words are!]. There is a material called chiri used alongside the welcoming basket in the Calcutta area during the wedding rites performed by the married women. In village Bengali the nickname of someone whose good name is Shriipati is usually chiru. The Arabic ta&#x301;lib-ul-ilm and Farsi ta&#x301;lib-e-ilm becomes ta&#x301;lbelim in spoken Urdu. However these are not exactly examples of emanation but rather specialties of distortion.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->This process of emanation is not limited to human language. Its influence can be noticed in the human physical constitution as well. The composition of the human body changes with the change in eras. In olden times people&#146;s hands were comparatively longer than they are today. Arms reaching down towards the knees used to be considered a sign of handsomeness in men. Kashiram Das in his description of Arjuna has written:<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="22..13"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->[Look at the young brahman, more handsome than Cupid, with eyebrows that extend to his eyes. Look at his excellent broad forehead and his joyful majestic gait like a kingly elephant. His arms down to his knees put even the snakes to shame. His fiery countenance seems to be enveloped in ashes.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->It may sound funny nowadays but it is quite true that there was a time when people could wag their ears to drive away flies and mosquitoes just as cows, horses and other animals can do today. Nowadays if a fly lands on our ear we can shoo it away with our hand. Since the use of the hand has increased in modern times people have lost the capacity to move their ears. Similarly, at one time human beings had a tail like other animals. One thing should be pointed out here. Many people say lej or lya&#x301;j instead of nya&#x301;j [tail] but this is incorrect. Due to specific linguistic rules nya&#x301;j can come from the Sanskrit nyuvjaka but lej or lya&#x301;j cannot. Nor does the word come from la&#x301;ungula because la&#x301;ungula does not have a ja. The Bengali word derived from the Sanskrit la&#x301;ungula is neun&#x32D;gun. I have heard this word used in Birbhum. I have heard this folk verse:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..15"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Chutore ka&#x301;t&#x301;h ka&#x301;t&#x301;e baga&#x301;te neun&#x32D;gun na&#x301;r&#x301;e<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..16"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->[a carpenter cuts wood/a heron moves its tail]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->In that era people used to live in trees. They used to secure themselves to the tree or the tree branch with their tail so that they would not fall out of the tree while they were asleep. Later on, when human beings began to build temporary dwellings in the trees, the possibility of falling out diminished. Naturally, since the need for a tail diminished, the tail became smaller. Later still, when human beings learned to build permanent dwellings on the ground the need for a tail completely disappeared. Since there is no need for a tail now, there is no tail. The need for a tail disappeared some hundreds of thousands of years ago. There is, however, a truncated bone at the base of the backbone which is a carryover from that past time. It is present in the foetus while it is in its mother&#146;s womb. Thereafter the tail does not grow in proportion to the rest of the body. By the time the human child is born the tail is no longer outside the body. A somewhat similar thing happens with frogs. The tadpole has a tail but when it gets bigger it falls off. This all happens in the path of emanation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->In those days there was little security in people&#146;s lives. On one side there were fierce animals and on the other a scarcity of food. Both of these were constants. Nowadays if there is a scarcity of food in one place people can bring food materials from someplace else but that was not possible then. If food appeared one day there was no certainty [nishcitata&#x301;] that it would appear the next.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.22.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#22.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> Due to these kinds of circumstances human beings used to have an appendix to their intestines for accumulated or excess food. As it was needed this food would stimulate salivation in the mouth and be fully eaten and digested. The proper eating and digesting of the surplus food in the appendix is called romanthana in Sanskrit and ja&#x301;bar ka&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301; in Bengali. In good English we call it &ldquo;rumination&rdquo; and in spoken English &ldquo;chewing the cud&rdquo;. Many herbivorous (vegetarian) animals still ruminate and a need still exists for it in their wild state. As the certainty of food supplies gradually increased, the need for a corporal appendix to the intestines lessened. Eventually there was even not the slightest need for it. Today a small vestige of it remains in the human body although it is no longer used in times of distress. Human beings have lost the capacity to ruminate.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->As with language, human dress and clothing also shows the clear influence of emanation. People&#146;s dress changes according to the geography and the weather. For example, the kind of clothes that people wear in hot countries is practically useless in cold countries. In rainy countries it becomes troublesome to walk around in coat and pants when the roads get muddy. So the people in such countries wear dhotis and similar kinds of clothes that can easily be hiked up above the knee and out of the mud&#146;s reach when there is the need. It is perhaps for this reason that the traditional Bengali dress was a dhoti and a shawl or loose upper garment. Nowadays, with the improvements in the roads, people are wearing pants. However if they need to go down to the fields they change from pants to dhoti or lungi.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->In those days people did not wear stitched clothes. At first they did not wear them because they did not know about sewing. Later on, sewn clothes were not worn partly due to a superstition based on them not having been worn before, and partly due to practical difficulties. Still today the bridegroom does not wear sewn clothes during the wedding in orthodox Hindu society. For a certain time during the wedding they have to wear dhoti and shawl or dhoti and garad [a type of silk fabric].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->The lungi [sarong] is a common Bengali dress. Actually it is not Bengali, per se. Luun&#x32D;gi is a Burmese word and the dress is also Burmese. At one time many people from Chittagong went to Burma to find work. They learned to wear it there and then introduced it to this country. During my childhood I noticed that many conservative families did not like to wear lungis. Nowadays people&#146;s point of view has changed and wearing it has become quite natural.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->As with the change in dress, a great change has come about in social customs and practices. According to the prevalent Bengali social practice, people were sent to bring or collect news between houses related by marriage. Along with this there was the custom of sending dhotis, saris and sweets. It was considered somewhat unbecoming if someone arrived empty-handed to receive or bring news, thus the practice of sending clothes and sweets was introduced. &ldquo;News&rdquo; used to be called tattva in refined Bengali in those days. Gradually this dhoti, sari and sweets came within the purview of the word tattva. In other words, &ldquo;tattva has arrived from the boy&#146;s father-in-law&#146;s house&rdquo; referred to what kind of clothes and what kind of sweets had arrived &ndash; the word had become bigger. Later on, when the word tattva had lost its actual or genuine meaning, a number of Calcutta confectioners (most likely residents of Hooghly District&#146;s Jana&#x301;i village) came up with a special variety of sweet made from cha&#x301;na&#x301;,<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.22.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#22.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> which was different from the man&#x301;d&#x301;a&#x301;, ka&#x301;nca&#x301; golla&#x301; or ma&#x301;kha&#x301; sandesh that were prevalent in Bengal prior to that. Since it became a favourite practice to send along some of this cha&#x301;na&#x301; sweet with the tattva, the name of the new sweet became sandesh which actually means &ldquo;all sorts of news&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Subsequently different varieties of sandesh came into existence under the dextrous magic hands of the confectioners. Confectioners of Pu&#x301;rvasthalii in Burdwan District invented ta&#x301;lsha&#x301;ns sandesh. During our childhood days the sandesh of Nar&#x301;iya&#x301; (Faridpur District) and Na&#x301;t&#x301;or (this place in Rajshahi District had, at one time, made a name for itself in confectionery, clay handicrafts and music) were also famous. It is not so that the confectioners of Pa&#x301;bna&#x301; District&#146;s Sira&#x301;jganj proved their artistry by making camcam. First they made sandesh from nalen gur&#x301;. The confectioners of Midnapore&#146;s Ra&#x301;dha&#x301;man&#x301;i made a&#x301;ta&#x301; sandesh and in Murshidabad dedo sandesh. The ka&#x301;nca&#x301; golla&#x301; of Mur&#x301;a&#x301;ga&#x301;cha&#x301; and Sa&#x301;tks&#x301;iira&#x301; reappeared in a new form with a new allure. In Calcutta one cannot go without mentioning a&#x301;va&#x301;r-kha&#x301;va sandesh. Rather than making the list any longer I will end here with the name kar&#x301;a&#x301; pa&#x301;k sandesh.

<a name="22..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->Emanation also affects script and letters. I have already mentioned that a language survives approximately one thousand years. Individual scripts, however, last about two thousand years. Written script did not exist at the beginning of the Yajurvedic era. Written script was invented in India towards the end of that era, that is, about five thousand years ago. At the time when script was invented the sages thought that the creation was a composite of a-u-ma, that is, creation, preservation and destruction. However, the manifest universe is a result of the influence of the gun&#x301;as of prakrti over consciousness &ndash; the supremacy of the binding faculty over the cognitive faculty. In other words, Parama Purus&#x301;a comes within the jurisdiction of the binding power of prakrti. This manifest universe is called sam&#x301;vrttibodhicitta in the Buddhist nomenclature and ka&#x301;ryabrahma (expressed universe) in Aryan nomenclature. In order to indicate this state of purus&#x301;a and prakrti a vertical line is used for purus&#x301;a and a horizontal line is used for prakrti. Together the two form a cross (+) which signifies ka&#x301;ryabrahma or the created universe. The biija [seed] mantra of ka&#x301;ryabrahma is ka so this cross became ka in the Bra&#x301;hmii script. Through the process of writing the Bra&#x301;hmii ka quickly it became transformed through distortion into today&#146;s letter ka. For example:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph --><img src="../../HTML/Images/Ka.PNG"><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->Hence we see that in the case of written script emanation also remains intact. The name of the first script invented by the people of India is Bra&#x301;hmii or Kharos&#x301;t&#x301;ii script. With the passage of time this Bra&#x301;hmii-Kharos&#x301;t&#x301;ii script evolved into three separate scripts. The name of the distorted script to the southwest of Allahabad is Na&#x301;rada&#x301; script. The distorted form to the northwest of Allahabad is Sa&#x301;rada&#x301; script. The script that arose in Allahabad and the lands east of there is known as Kut&#x301;ila&#x301; script.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->The area where Na&#x301;rada&#x301; script was used included the western areas of modern Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Sindhu, Gujarat and Maharashtra. The Na&#x301;gar pandits of Gujarat wrote many Sanskrit compositions in Na&#x301;rada&#x301; script. Later the script was named Na&#x301;garii after them. When they wrote their local language in this script they used to call it Deshii Na&#x301;garii or Mor&#x301;i. When they wrote Sanskrit (devabha&#x301;s&#x301;a&#x301;) they would write with conjuncts by joining the upper lines [ma&#x301;tra&#x301;]. Then they would call the script Devana&#x301;garii. Although the modern Gujarati script is Deshiina&#x301;garii and does not have ma&#x301;tra&#x301;, it does have conjuncts. Among the Mor&#x301;i scripts that were used to write the different languages of Rajasthan (Marwari, Meva&#x301;rii, Har&#x301;aoti, D&#x301;hund&#x301;ha&#x301;ru, Meva&#x301;ti, etc.), western Madhya Pradesh (Ma&#x301;lavii, Bundelii), and Maharashtra (Marathi, Vara&#x301;r&#x301;i, Kha&#x301;ndeshii, Kom&#x301;kanii), Maharashtra&#146;s Mor&#x301;i has conjuncts in certain circumstances. However the remaining Mor&#x301;i scripts did not and do not have conjuncts. Although modern Marathi books and so forth are printed in Devana&#x301;garii script, Devana&#x301;garii is not Maharashtra&#146;s script. The Mor&#x301;i scripts of Rajasthan (Curuwalii, Yodhpurii, Jhunjhunwalii, etc.) are still commonly used by the general public, especially by merchants. Sindhu&#146;s script is not used for printing modern-day books and so on. Books in Sindhi are now printed with Farsi script, however the old Sindhi script, or La&#x301;ha&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ei, is still prevalent among merchants.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->The northwestern Sa&#x301;rada&#x301; script evolved into several branches. The T&#x301;ekr&#x301;i, T&#x301;egr&#x301;i or T&#x301;em&#x301;r&#x301;ei (this script is a close relative of Tibetan script) scripts of the Himalayan mountain regions, Laddaki script (it is also a close relative of Tibetan script), Kashmiri Sa&#x301;rada&#x301; (the script in which the modern-day Kashmir pandits write Sanskrit), and Duggardeshii Sa&#x301;rada&#x301; (the script of Jammu&#146;s Dogri language), etc. are all distortions of the ancient Sa&#x301;rada&#x301; script. The script in which modern-day Panjabi is written is known as Gur&#x301;mukhii script. It is not a natural distortion of Sa&#x301;rada&#x301;. The Sikh guru, Arjanadeva, introduced this script (there is some difference of opinion regarding this). This script does not have full conjuncts either, however if some effort is made conjuncts can be introduced. This will eliminate the need to write words such as skul, st&#x301;ap, st&#x301;eshan, etc. as sakul, satap, sat&#x301;eshan.<!-- /block --></p>

Had they looked into it a little more deeply they would have realized that the Vedas were not written down in ancient times because written script did not exist. Later, when the Vedas could no longer be committed to memory, the Kashmir pandits were the first to write them down and they did so in this distorted Sa&#x301;rada&#x301; script.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.22.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#22.fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>

<a name="22..34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->Although the scientific name of the script that arose in the lands east of Allahabad is Kut&#x301;ila&#x301;, it is better known as Shriihars&#x301;a in the annals of history. The gold coins of the emperor Hars&#x301;avarddhan were inscribed with this script. It has been found in Kaosha&#x301;mbi near Allahabad. Modern Bengali, Maethilii, Manipuri, Assamese and Oriya are written in this script. The scripts of Angika, Bhojpuri, Magahii, Chattisgarhi and Nagpuri are also Shriihars&#x301;a scripts, but since the people have forgotten their mother scripts and have not been able to create a developed literature of their own up until now, they do their writing and reading nowadays in Hindi. Since Hindi books are printed in Devana&#x301;garii script they are more familiar with Devana&#x301;garii script.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->Oriya script is also Shriihars&#x301;a script but the people of those days used to write on palm leaves with a type of iron spud. In order to keep the palm leaves from being torn by the iron spud they rounded off the corners. Thus the modern-day Oriya script looks somewhat circular. Actually Bengali script and Oriya script are the same. The letters of Bengali script have corners, that is, they are angular, while Oriya script is circular. So in the olden days Bengali script used to be called the Gaor&#x301;iiya [Bengali] style of Kut&#x301;ila&#x301; script and Oriya used to be called the Od&#x301;ra style of Kut&#x301;ila&#x301; script.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..36"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph -->The effect of emanation can also be seen in Bengali script.

<a name="22..38"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=38 type=paragraph -->In old Bengali one ta was written underneath the other to indicate tta. Nowadays, however, the tail of the upper ta does not extend back up and the hem of the lower ta begins where the tail leaves off; the letter looks like the letter o. The difference is that tta has an upper line [ma&#x301;tra&#x301;] while the o does not. Similarly, the conjunct tra was written with a ra below the ta. Nowadays the tail of ta does not extend back up and the hem of the ra begins where it leaves off. The letter looks like the letter e, the difference being that the letter e does not have a ma&#x301;tra&#x301; while the conjunct tra does. If you look at any of the Bengali compound letters you will find that they are actually a proper blending of the original letters. This blending results from taking the path of emanation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..39"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=39 type=paragraph -->We were talking about the Sa&#x301;rada&#x301;, Na&#x301;rada&#x301; and Kut&#x301;ila&#x301; scripts. The Sa&#x301;rada&#x301; script developed from the Bra&#x301;hmii script; it achieved its full form about thirteen hundred years ago. Similarly, the Kut&#x301;ila&#x301; script achieved its maturity about eleven hundred years ago and the Na&#x301;garii script about eight hundred years ago. Thus very old Sanskrit manuscripts can be found in this Sa&#x301;rada&#x301; script. Moderately old manuscripts are found in Kut&#x301;ila&#x301; or Shriihars&#x301;a script. Nowadays those who are involved in deciphering obscure passages of old Sanskrit texts and reprinting those texts cannot avoid taking the help of scholars versed in the Sa&#x301;rada&#x301; and Shriihars&#x301;a scripts. During British rule, when arrangements were made for the study of Sanskrit in universities, there was a need felt to print the textbooks in a specific script so they began printing them in Devana&#x301;garii script. The use of Devana&#x301;garii script instead of Shriihars&#x301;a for Sanskrit in Varanasi, the then centre of Sanskrit study, became common at that time despite the fact that the local script was Shriihars&#x301;a and that Shriihars&#x301;a is found on stone engravings recovered there. However the pandits at Sanskrit schools in different parts of India used to write Sanskrit in their customary local script and still do so today. So no one should harbour the conception that Devana&#x301;garii is Sanskrit&#146;s only script. Actually Sanskrit does not have its own script. Every script commonly used in different parts of India is Sanskrit&#146;s script. Among these, the Sa&#x301;rada&#x301;, Shriihars&#x301;a and the south Indian scripts are older than Devana&#x301;garii.<!-- /block --></p>

In old Bengali ya, ma and va used to retain their separate pronunciation when they occurred as conjuncts; however in modern Bengali, that is, for the last one thousand years, they no longer have their own separate pronunciation. For example, in modern Bengali we write padma&#x301; [lotus] but we read it padda&#x301; because in modern Bengali the rule is that whenever va, ma or ya are conjuncted to a consonant the pronunciation of that consonant is doubled &ndash; va, ma or ya are not pronounced.

Although it may be a bit off the subject, change comes about not only in the beauty of things shaped by human beings but also, it can be mentioned, in the case of cuisine. Spices [mashala&#x301;] were not used as much in Bengali cuisine as they are today. The word itself, mashala&#x301;, is not native to this country. The word is Farsi (mashalla&#x301;). As with Bengal, the use of spices in England at that time was also extremely limited. In fact, even the word &ldquo;spice&rdquo; is not originally English. Nowadays spices are used extensively in Bengal but the use of spices in the kitchens of England has not increased at the same rate. In old Bengal cumin, black pepper, long pepper, coriander and turmeric were used as spices.

In Kahlan&#146;s Ra&#x301;jataraunginii one comes across these lines: Sa&#x301;rada&#x301;mat&#x301;hama&#x301;rabhya kumkuma&#x301;dritata&#x301;m&#x301;takah</p>

<a name="23..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The subject of today&#146;s discussion is distortion. The change that takes place in the flow of emanation is a natural change. In other words, everything in the flow of emanation is moving (calat or calama&#x301;n). In very ancient times the verbal root cal was a&#x301;tmanepadii. Later on it became parasmaepadii. During Panini&#146;s time the parasmaepadii form was used but in order to show respect for the ancient Vedic verb form he accepted both the a&#x301;tmanepadii and parasmaepadii forms of the verbal root cal and declared it ubhayapadii. So in this case both calat and calama&#x301;na are correct.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Everything in this cosmos is moving. Nothing stops, so whatever moves also has to undergo change. This is the law of providence [vidha&#x301;ta&#x301;]. The name of the system by which the Supreme Consciousness carries out the various activities of the universe is known as vidha&#x301;ta&#x301;; that is, vidha&#x301;ta&#x301; is not a specific entity but rather a specific system. So vidha&#x301;ta&#x301; is required to follow its own rules of creation. It does not have the right to do anything in a haphazard way. Whatever action takes place in this world follows this rule; that is, it moves in accordance with the flow of change. When this natural change occurs in the case of language we call it utsa&#x301;ran&#x301;a or emanation. Everything comes out from the point of emanation and moves forward in the path of crest and trough. This movement is emanation. The initial undulatory impetus that is present at the beginning of emanation gradually wanes as it passes through shocks and counter-shocks.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Some people use the word stimita in Bengali for this lessening or waning. For example, diipashikha&#x301; stimita haye eseche [the flame of the lamp has waned], but it is worth keeping in mind that actually there is no such word as stimita in Sanskrit. Most probably the word stimita became commonly used for the waning of light by thinking of the decaying light of the astamita [setting] sun. Those who helped to make it commonly used thought that perhaps they had found a dignified Sanskrit word. In fact the word stimita is utterly incorrect. It is like the a&#x301;ka&#x301;shakusuma [sky-flower] which is non-existent from its initial a&#x301; to its final ma. Similarly, many people parade about the word anushiilana. They think that it is perhaps a Sanskrit word of august lineage created by adding the prefix anu and the suffix anat&#x301; to the verbal root shiil. Actually there is no such Sanskrit word as anushiilana. It is similar to ru&#x301;pakatha&#x301;. There is no such word as ru&#x301;pakatha&#x301; in Sanskrit. What is called &ldquo;fiction&rdquo; in English and also &ldquo;novel&rdquo; under specific circumstances, is called katha&#x301; in Sanskrit (for example, harikatha&#x301;, satyana&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;er katha&#x301; &ndash; maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rater katha&#x301; amrta sama&#x301;n/ka&#x301;shiira&#x301;m da&#x301;sha kahe shune pun&#x301;yava&#x301;n). If this katha&#x301; happens to be one of absorbing interest then it is called katha&#x301;nika&#x301; in Sanskrit. This became kaha&#x301;nia&#x301; in Pra&#x301;krta and from that kaha&#x301;nii in modern Hindi. This kaha&#x301;nii is called gappa in Maethilii and under special circumstances galpa. From the same descent we also get the Bengali word galpa [story]. In Bengali we have taken the word kaha&#x301;nii, dressed it up with a nose ring and earrings and made the word ka&#x301;hinii. There is no firm ground below the feet of ka&#x301;hinii. It is standing on quicksand. A very short story or a story for little ones or an enjoyable but unreliable story is called upakatha&#x301; in Sanskrit. It is common rural error to substitute ra for a and a for ra. For example in Rarh-Murshidabad I have heard a&#x301;mba&#x301;bur ra&#x301;mba&#x301;ga&#x301;ne.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.23.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#23.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> It has been said about the village opera party:<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="23..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Similarly, the word enr&#x301;i [castor] has been formed from the Sanskrit word eran&#x301;d&#x301;a which is a&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;i in Hindi and en&#x301;d&#x301;i in Assamese. However in Bengali, with the passage of time, enr&#x301;i became rer&#x301;i &ndash; ra has occupied the place of a. Rer&#x301;i is not only used in Bengali but also in the languages of Bihar. In Calcutta Bengali we call a snake charmer or an exorcist rojha&#x301; instead of ojha&#x301; and the white ant rui instead of ui. So by this process we have changed upakatha&#x301; into ru&#x301;pakatha&#x301;. Some of us while singing the Aviba&#x301;bu&#146;s<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.23.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#23.fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> songs fertilize the soil with &ldquo;rammonia&rdquo; fertilizer.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Those who import new words without knowing their meaning or polish up old words a bit to create new words in Bengali and think &ldquo;it&#146;s a good thing we have found&rdquo; would do better to be aware of the meaning. Idea is extremely vast but the capacity of language is very limited so if any idea is to be captured by language it should only be done after correctly understanding the meaning of the language used. In addition to this, one should also consider that language should not be lengthened without reason. If the opportunity presents itself a compound word may be found. I have heard that one poet had written a book by the name of anek pa&#x301;oya&#x301;r ma&#x301;jhe ma&#x301;jhe ekt&#x301;ukha&#x301;ni pa&#x301;oya&#x301;, ta&#x301;te ja&#x301;ga&#x301;y dakhin ha&#x301;oya&#x301; [in between much getting is a little getting in which awakens the southern breeze]. Since the publisher did not agree to publish the book with such a long name a mutual agreement was finally reached between both parties. The name became anek pa&#x301;oya&#x301;. 1/4 dakhin ha&#x301;oya&#x301; [much getting 1/4 southern breeze].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->A certain gentleman from Bankura District once told my aunt from Khandaghosa: &ldquo;In your Burdwan District there is very little cultivation of potatoes.&rdquo; She replied: &ldquo;Why don&#146;t you come and see for yourself. In our Burdwan District the cultivation of potatoes is apariyukta.&rdquo; Here auntie used literary language and made aparya&#x301;pta [abundant] into apariyukta. In this situation, someone may think that the word is pure Sanskrit and that it has come from a &ndash; pari &ndash; yuj + kta, but how could this be possible! Ta&#x301;leber Miina&#x301;&#146;s goat ate madam&#146;s greens. Because madam became very angry due to this, Ta&#x301;leber Miina&#x301; said, &ldquo;Madam, don&#146;t do any more a&#x301;ndolacana&#x301; (andolana [agitation] = a&#x301;locana&#x301; [discussion]) over this.&rdquo; This is very high level Bengali indeed!

<a name="23..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->In this matter my contention is that in the case of language and literature this cooking up of accounts does not help anyone in any way. However it is not always so that this cooking of accounts is done knowingly. There are two common Sanskrit words for those who live by farming &ndash; krs&#x301;ibala and kars&#x301;aka. Those who spelt kars&#x301;aka krs&#x301;aka committed the error without being aware of it, and the people who still write it krs&#x301;aka today do so without realizing their error. Does the mistake end here? Many people srjan kare instead of sarjan kare [create] and many people have srjanii pratibha&#x301; [creative faculty]. Although we have changed sarjan into srjan we have not changed utsarjan or visarjan into utsrjan or visrjan. This, it seems, suggests that some people still have sarjanii shakti [creative energy]. Does this erroneous invention stop here! From where do we get the odd word ga&#x301;bhii? The word is gavii and its spoken Bengali form is ga&#x301;i (female cow). The word ga&#x301;bhii is completely incorrect. Now all of you, I hope, no longer write words such as itipu&#x301;rve or itimadhye because the correct words are itahpu&#x301;rve and itahmadhye. However, if you like, the letter o can be used to replace the visarga (h) (that is, itopu&#x301;rve, itomadhye). But the visarga has to be retained in the spelling of spas&#x301;t&#x301;atah [clearly] because tah is the fifth case-ending. However it is not good to retain the visarga when writing spas&#x301;t&#x301;atai because it is not proper to place a vowel right next to a visarga. So spas&#x301;t&#x301;atahi is incorrect; spas&#x301;t&#x301;atai is correct. Jyotih ca&#x301;ridike ujjval kare tuleche [the light has illuminated all around] &ndash; here jyotih will have a visarga but jyotihi a&#x301;ma&#x301;r dhyeya [light is my object of meditation] should not take a visarga.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->The word abhijin&#x32D;a has been created for &ldquo;one who knows well&rdquo; by adding the prefix abhi and the suffix d&#x301;a to the verbal root jin&#x32D;a&#x301;. For &ldquo;one who is not abhijin&#x32D;a&rdquo; the negation an is added to make anabhijin&#x32D;a which means &ldquo;one who does not know well&rdquo; (an is added before a vowel and a before a consonant). I have noticed that even many educated people write abhijin&#x32D;a in Hindi for &ldquo;one who knows not&rdquo; and bhijin&#x32D;a for &ldquo;one who knows&rdquo;. Bear in mind that there is no such word as bhijin&#x32D;a, either in grammar or in usage. Hence it would be better if they eradicated this word from the world of their imagination because if the word bhijin&#x32D;a is used for &ldquo;one who knows&rdquo; then abhijin&#x32D;a will have to be used for &ldquo;one who does not know&rdquo; though it means &ldquo;one who knows well&rdquo;. If this error is infecting any other language then it should be quarantined.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->The Old Latin word karanta or quaranta means &ldquo;sheep&rdquo; and the old Latin adjective meaning &ldquo;concerning sheep&rdquo; is quarantine. In English also the adjective for the word &ldquo;sheep&rdquo; is &ldquo;quarantine&rdquo;. At one time, when sheep&#146;s health was not given much attention, some of them used to occasionally suffer from infectious diseases and the nearby sheep used to die along with them. So the means that was adopted in those days to save the other sheep from infection was called &ldquo;quarantine&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->The English word &ldquo;research&rdquo; means to go even further into something than what we see at first glance, to go deeper still, gathering more and more, doing a new search, looking anew. Its Bengali or Sanskrit synonym cannot be anushiilana because the word anushiilana is an error. Nor can it be carca&#x301; because the English for the word carca&#x301; is &ldquo;culture&rdquo;. In Hindi one says shodhaka&#x301;rya but shodhaka&#x301;rya also does not convey the proper meaning. Either vishad sandha&#x301;n [thorough search] or gaves&#x301;an&#x301;a&#x301; should be chosen for this.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->In ancient times the sages used to live in forest areas outside the towns or villages. If one of their domesticated animals would get lost they used to give the responsibility of going out into the jungle in search of the animal to the most mischievous student. This poor fellow would go out and spend the entire day wandering about looking for the animal. In Sanskrit es&#x301;an&#x301;a&#x301; means &ldquo;the desire to get&rdquo;. Hence &ldquo;one who goes out and wanders around with the desire to get the cow&rdquo; is go + es&#x301;an&#x301;a&#x301; = gaves&#x301;an&#x301;a&#x301;. So if the word gaves&#x301;an&#x301;a&#x301; is used for the word &ldquo;research&rdquo; it does indeed translate the essential or core meaning of the original idea, however, the practical meaning is not correct. If, for example, someone is doing medical research into a complex disease will we then say that they are &ldquo;cow-searching&rdquo; the medicine of that disease? So the pandits should sit together and decide whether vishad sandha&#x301;n should be used or another similar word.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Those who named the Octorloney Monument Shahid Minar did so without properly understanding the meaning of the word shahiid. Those brave warriors who take part in the Islamic religious wars (jeha&#x301;dd) are called muja&#x301;hid in Arabic. Those muja&#x301;hids who give up their life in battle are called shahiid. Those who are victorious in battle are called ga&#x301;jii (if they live, ga&#x301;jii; if they die, shahiid). Similarly, those who give up their life in the Christian religious wars (crusades) are called &ldquo;martyrs&rdquo;. By what logic then do we call those brave progeny who give up their life for their country or for any other great cause shahiid? Instead, we can use the word dadhiici for them because Mahars&#x301;i Dadhiici sacrificed his life for the welfare of others. He did not lose his life in a jihad or crusade.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->There is a rule in Latin and in many other European languages, including English, that if the singular is &ldquo;um&rdquo; then the plural is &ldquo;a&rdquo; and if the singular is &ldquo;us&rdquo; then the singular is &ldquo;i&rdquo;. For example, &ldquo;memorandum&rdquo; becomes &ldquo;memoranda&rdquo;, &ldquo;stratum&rdquo; becomes &ldquo;strata&rdquo;, &ldquo;cactus&rdquo; becomes &ldquo;cacti&rdquo;, &ldquo;lotus&rdquo; becomes &ldquo;loti&rdquo;, etc. However in numerous instances nowadays we see &ldquo;memorandums&rdquo;, &ldquo;cactuses&rdquo;, &ldquo;lotuses&rdquo;, &ldquo;stratums&rdquo;. Why this disorder? The plural of &ldquo;cash-memo&rdquo; is &ldquo;cash-mema&rdquo; but all around us we see a crowd of &ldquo;cash-memos&rdquo;.

<a name="23..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->At any rate, the wavelength of everything moving in this universe changes. In accordance with this, a natural change occurs within every word. As a result of this change newer and newer words are created and newer and newer languages are created. The old language that was so real at one time becomes unreal &ndash; it gets lost in the obscurity of the past. That which was so close at one time becomes distant and that which was yet to come in the bosom of the past becomes a reality at a later time.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->In the case of words, this natural change is utsa&#x301;ran&#x301;a (ut &ndash; sr + n&#x301;ic anat&#x301; = utsa&#x301;ran&#x301;a) [emanation]. If it is not causative then it is utsaran&#x301;a. For example, in the sense of someone reading [studying] pat&#x301;h + anat&#x301; makes pat&#x301;hana but for reading to someone else [teaching] pat&#x301;h + n&#x301;ic anat&#x301; = pa&#x301;t&#x301;hana. The verbal root sr means &ldquo;to move&rdquo;. That where someone has come to move on is called saraka [road], not sar&#x301;aka. Similarly, the addition of the suffix ghain&#x32D; to sam &ndash; sr makes sam&#x301;sa&#x301;ra [world], that is, where everything moves, where nothing remains static. It is worth noticing that we call this natural change &ldquo;emanation&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;distortion&rdquo; because distortion refers to a special form of change or a corrupted form of change. In Sanskrit grammar it is called vivarttana.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Linguistic vivarttana or distortion happens primarily due to three reasons. First, it occurs when a certain number of people cannot pronounce a word correctly. In such cases the linguistic distortion does not take the path of emanation. For example, the corrupted pronunciation of the word cikitsa&#x301; has become cikiccha&#x301;. The pronunciation of mahotsava became mocchava. In such cases the impetus of the word after it gets corrupted is checked. It does not undergo further distortion. In other words, when the pronunciation of the word cikitsa&#x301; becomes corrupted and changes to cikiccha&#x301; then its movement stops. I have heard many rural people call bhisa&#x301; bhica&#x301;, mesh mec and &ldquo;selection&rdquo; &ldquo;cheleccion&rdquo;. This is distortion, that is, afterwards there is no further vivarttana.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Another word of this sort is da&#x301;pana [mirror]. The word da&#x301;pana comes from the Sanskrit word darpan&#x301;a &ndash; Sanskrit darpan&#x301;a &rarr; Pra&#x301;krta dappana &rarr; old Bengali da&#x301;pana. It has not undergone any further distortion in the past thirteen hundred years. Although we use the Sanskrit-borrowed word darpan&#x301;a in modern times, we do not use the Sanskrit-derived word da&#x301;pana because it has been created through faulty pronunciation. These are examples of distortion or vivarttana.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->Often distortion of a word takes place through abbreviation. For example, we say ya&#x301;ccheta&#x301;i [as one pleases]. Ya&#x301;ccheta&#x301;i is not a real word. Actually, the word is ya&#x301;-icche-ta&#x301;i. Similarly, &ldquo;artificiality&rdquo; is called bana&#x301;ot&#x301;i in Hindi-Urdu but actually the word is bana&#x301; + vat&#x301; + ii = bana&#x301;vat&#x301;ii. It is pronounced bana&#x301;ot&#x301;i. Likewise, dekhala&#x301; + vat&#x301; + ii = dekhlavat&#x301;ii but it is pronounced dekhla&#x301;ot&#x301;i. I have seen some people, especially in Marathi, spell words that end in ktin (for example prakrti, a&#x301;krti) with long ii (for example, prakrtii, a&#x301;krtii). However, words that end in ktin should be spelled with short i (prakrti, a&#x301;krti). Otherwise it will be mistaken for the corresponding kta-ending word (in this case prakrta) with the suffix iip added.<!-- /block --></p>

For example, lar&#x301;ka&#x301; + pan = lar&#x301;ka&#x301;pan but through abbreviation it becomes lar&#x301;akpan. Bacca&#x301; + pana&#x301; = bacpana&#x301;. In this case it is clear that the a&#x301; of lar&#x301;ka&#x301; and bacca&#x301; has been omitted for the sake of abbreviation. &ldquo;One who wants to learn&rdquo; is called ta&#x301;lib-e-ilm in Farsi. In spoken Urdu we abbreviate it and say ta&#x301;lbelim, that is, we no longer pronounce the i of ilm. In Calcutta Bengali we say a&#x301;dekhlepana&#x301; for a&#x301;-dekhila&#x301;-pana&#x301;. In these cases distortion is effected through abbreviation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->The distortion that occurs in this way sometimes has the opportunity for emanation and sometimes not. For example, the word da&#x301;pan did not have that opportunity. The question arises as to why it does not always have this kind of chance. The reason is that in regard to emanation the movement of distortion is obstructed when the distortion is unnatural. In other cases, where the distortion happens in a natural way, the distortion proceeds forward, for example, prastara &rarr; patthara &rarr; pa&#x301;thar &ndash; not pa&#x301;tha&#x301;r. Pa&#x301;tha&#x301;r means &ldquo;vast field&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->Some places have splendid greenery. To praise it we call it &ldquo;Greenwich&rdquo;. Its pronunciation has been shortened to griinic. Splendid greenery refers to a place that is easily reached by the sun&#146;s rays. Such places are good for conducting research on heavenly bodies. They also have special importance for the measurement of latitude and longitude. Anyhow, although this place in Britain is spelled &ldquo;Greenwich&rdquo; it is pronounced griinic. Due to this kind of abbreviation &ldquo;sandwich&rdquo; has become sa&#x301;ndic. &ldquo;Northwest wind&rdquo; has become &ldquo;nor&#x301;wester&rdquo;. For this reason Bengal&#146;s ka&#x301;lvaesha&#x301;khii is called &ldquo;nor&#x301;wester&rdquo; in English. The wind is named according to the direction in which it moves, not the direction from where it arises. However this is not a hard and fast rule because in the Calcutta area the wind that comes from the Bay of Bengal, that is, from the south, we call the &ldquo;south wind&rdquo; [daks&#x301;in&#x301;a&#x301; va&#x301;yu]. The wind that comes from the Himalayas we call the &ldquo;north wind&rdquo;. The wind which arises in the Bay of Bengal and moves in a northwesterly direction is called the &ldquo;northwest wind&rdquo;, &ldquo;nor&#x301;wester&rdquo; for short. Incidentally it bears mentioning that the word ha&#x301;oya&#x301; [wind] is a Turkish word. I have seen the words turk-ha&#x301;oa-vallarii written on a Turkish plane.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->Abbreviation is quite common in English. It is sometimes accomplished by making the word shorter and sometimes by taking the initial letters of words. For example, &ldquo;general purpose car&rdquo; was abbreviated to &ldquo;G.P. car&rdquo;. Subsequently it was further abbreviated to &ldquo;G.P.&rdquo; Later on it was abbreviated even more to giip and in a later stage the spelling changed to &ldquo;jeep&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->This distortion is commonly brought within the scope of an aphorism. A&#x301;, i, u &ndash; their pronunciation is lost and ao changes into o. For example, aos&#x301;adh became os&#x301;udh. In spoken Maethilii and Angika one says okhadh. According to the Yajurvedic style of pronunciation s&#x301;a is pronounced kha so aos&#x301;adh became okhadh.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->In many languages of north India i is written but it is no longer pronounced. One writes lar&#x301;ika&#x301; but it is pronounced lar&#x301;ka&#x301;. One writes a&#x301;ju but pronounces it a&#x301;j. The dropping of the interior a&#x301; in lar&#x301;ka&#x301;pan to make lar&#x301;akpan has already been discussed.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->At one time in America a fierce war was raging. Many of the soldiers were Spanish-speaking and were not able to understand English, much less speak it. In order to send information about how someone was doing they were told to simply write &ldquo;all correct&rdquo;, which meant that everything was going fine. I have just said that the soldiers did not know English. Hence they used to write &ldquo;ol korect&rdquo; for &ldquo;all correct&rdquo;. After this &ldquo;Ol Korect&rdquo; had been in use for some time they abbreviated it to &ldquo;O. K.&rdquo; thinking what was the need of using such a long word. It had the same meaning, that is, that everything was going fine. Now this &ldquo;O.K.&rdquo; is used practically everywhere in the world with this same meaning. The spelling has been kept as &ldquo;okay&rdquo; or &ldquo;okey&rdquo;. On this basis sayings have been made such as &ldquo;He has already okayed it.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->There is a word adhik in Bengali. By adding the suffix s&#x301;n&#x301;ya to it we get a&#x301;dhikya [increase, excess]. A&#x301;dhikya is an abstract noun so there is no need to add the suffix ta&#x301; [ness], which makes it an abstract noun twice over. However the word a&#x301;dhikyata&#x301; has been created in Bengali and through corrupted pronunciation the word a&#x301;dikhyeta&#x301; [fussing] has been created. If the suffix ta&#x301; is added to the word adhika in Bengali to form the word adhikata&#x301; then it is correct but no one feels any attraction for the word adhikata&#x301;. Although the word a&#x301;dikhyeta&#x301; is incorrect it is more attractive. The word is full of feeling and is used quite a bit in gossip. It is like a potato chop with puffed rice on a rainy season evening.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->There is a system of making new words by using the first letter of very long words; it exists in all of the world&#146;s languages. Many Sanskrit aphorisms have been made in this way, for example, a&#x301;gama. In one shloka it is said:<!-- /block --></p>

Twelve hundred years ago in Bengal, when the Buddhist era was in progress, there was a Buddhist poet by the name of Bhu-su-ku. The name Bhu-su-ku was created by taking the first letter from several different words &ndash; from the word bhojana [food] bhu, from the word shayana [lying down] su and from the word karma [action] ku. With these three letters the word Bhu-su-ku was created. In other words, he who is absorbed in his ideology while sleeping, eating or doing work is Bhu-su-ku. There is an old Bengali song written by Bhu-su-ku about twelve hundred years ago.<!-- /block --></p>

This is not the fact. We come across the word &ldquo;Baun&#x32D;ga&#x301;l&rdquo; in twelve hundred year old poetry. If the word is not old, then where did the word baun&#x32D;ga&#x301;lii come from? In terms of its name, this land is quite old. One can infer that the civilization and culture of that place had at one time spread far and wide. Otherwise how could it have had a name in most of the world&#146;s languages? The word &ldquo;Banjala&rdquo; has been used since ancient times in the languages of China for the land of Bengal and in Latin it was &ldquo;Banjal&rdquo;. In Latin the adjective becomes banjalitis, which means &ldquo;produced in Bengal&rdquo; or &ldquo;concerning Bengal&rdquo;. The large variety of ca&#x301;npa&#x301; flower which we call jahurii ca&#x301;npa&#x301; in Bengali (in Sanskrit we call it hiirakacampaka) is called magnolia pamela banjalitis in Latin.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.23.fn5"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#23.fn5">5</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> In Turkey Bengal used to be called &ldquo;Bangala&rdquo; (the word &ldquo;Bangala&rdquo; can still be found in ancient documents). In Farsi and Urdu it is called &ldquo;Bangal&rdquo;. In English it is called &ldquo;Bengal&rdquo;. Many people mistakenly pronounce it beun&#x32D;gal. In Bengali it is called &ldquo;Baungla&#x301;desh&rdquo; (Bangladesh is not only Dhaka and Chittagong; it is also Burdwan and Midnapore). In Sanskrit it is called &ldquo;Baun&#x32D;gadesha&rdquo; or &ldquo;Gaor&#x301;adesha&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..40"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=40 type=paragraph -->New words are also created through abbreviation in Bengali. For example, the word khit&#x301;kel in Bengali comes from khit&#x301;a&#x301; ka&#x301;ul. The Sanskrit word kalaun&#x32D;kaka&#x301;rii became keleun&#x32D;ka&#x301;rii. Another such word is ka&#x301;labos. This word comes from ka&#x301;li-ba&#x301;us, that is, the fish that likes to remain in blackish waters or in areas near black soil is ka&#x301;li ba&#x301;us. The expenditure expended on wages for casting ornaments, that is, the cost of making them, used to be called ba&#x301;na&#x301;i expense. This ba&#x301;na&#x301;i has become abbreviated nowadays to ba&#x301;ni. In former times some people used to take a ba&#x301;ni as the assets and liabilities of the wedding and some did not.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..41"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=41 type=paragraph -->If we analyse the word &ldquo;distortion&rdquo; we get three parts &ndash; dis + tort + ion. &ldquo;Dis&rdquo; is the prefix, &ldquo;tort&rdquo; is the verbal root and &ldquo;ion&rdquo; is the suffix. &ldquo;Dis&rdquo; is a Latin prefix. The result of handling something in a confused, disorderly or undesirable way is &ldquo;distortion&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..42"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=42 type=paragraph -->In the field of language this process of distortion is not very pervasive. After following its course for a long time it finally becomes widespread and then it is given acceptance, for example, a&#x301;dikhyeta&#x301; in Bengali, bhu&#x301;ta&#x301;ha&#x301; in Hindi (&ldquo;haunted house&rdquo; in English), and &ldquo;knife&rdquo; in English. Actually &ldquo;knife&rdquo; is a French word. The original word was knif, but through faulty pronunciation in English it became distorted and knif became &ldquo;knife&rdquo;. Although the pronunciation of the original word&#146;s &ldquo;k&rdquo; was lost, the silent letter &ldquo;k&rdquo; has been retained even today in the English spelling.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..43"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=43 type=paragraph -->In Bengali pronunciation distortion follows the rule of minimum increase. For example, if two opposite entities are present in any incident, then in that case the compound word embodying that contrast that is formed &ndash; whether it be noun, modifier or verb &ndash; will have an a&#x301; at the end of the first word (or in special cases an o) and an i at the end of the second word. For example, the two components are made with la&#x301;t&#x301;hi. The compound word is la&#x301;t&#x301;ha&#x301;la&#x301;t&#x301;hi. Similar is the case with ma&#x301;ra&#x301;ma&#x301;ri, ka&#x301;r&#x301;a&#x301;ka&#x301;r&#x301;i, dhvasta&#x301;dhvasti. Two women have grabbed a fistful of one another&#146;s hair &ndash; that is cula&#x301;culi (culoculi). Other examples are dekha&#x301;dekhi, sara&#x301;sari, ha&#x301;sa&#x301;ha&#x301;si, ta&#x301;r&#x301;a&#x301;ta&#x301;r&#x301;i. Ta&#x301;r&#x301;a&#x301; comes from the Sanskrit word tvara&#x301; and from ta&#x301;r&#x301;a&#x301; comes the compound word ta&#x301;r&#x301;a&#x301;ta&#x301;r&#x301;i. Indeed we say ata ta&#x301;r&#x301;a&#x301; kiiser [What&#146;s the hurry]?<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.23.fn6"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#23.fn6">6</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> Then there is t&#x301;hesa&#x301;t&#x301;hesi and so many more. This kind of compound word has greatly increased the vitality of the Bengali language. An effort can also be made to create this kind of compound word in other languages. Every language would be benefited thereby.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..44"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=44 type=paragraph -->In conclusion we can say: let there be an even more pervasive study of the science of language and through this let the learned and talented have more correspondence [lekha&#x301;lekhi] instead of scuffling [ha&#x301;ta&#x301;ha&#x301;ti] and fighting [ha&#x301;na&#x301;ha&#x301;ni].<!-- /block --></p>
