<a name="3..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The object of the art of healing is to cure a patient, both physically and mentally. So the main question is not to uphold any particular school of medical science; rather, the key task is the welfare of the patient.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Just as diseased body organs can be restored to normal by administering medicines internally or externally, they can also be healed, more safely and more perfectly, with the help of yogic <i>a&#x301;sanas</i> and <i>mudra&#x301;s</i>. The aim of this book, therefore, is to make the general public aware of the yogic methods of treating the various illnesses.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->My purpose is to let people cure themselves by practising the <i>a&#x301;sanas</i> and <i>mudra&#x301;s</i> described in this book. People are requested not to take the risk of practising <i>a&#x301;sanas</i> and <i>mudra&#x301;s</i> by themselves, but rather to do so under the guidance of an experienced <i>a&#x301;ca&#x301;rya</i> [spiritual teacher]. Ananda Marga <i>a&#x301;ca&#x301;ryas</i> will always be ready to help without any remuneration. Detailed instructions for practising the <i>a&#x301;sanas</i> and <i>mudra&#x301;s,</i> for bathing, etc. have been given in Part Three of <i>Ananda Marga Carya&#x301;carya</i> (Shrii Shrii A&#x301;nandamu&#x301;rti, <i>Carya&#x301;carya Part III</i> [A&#x301;nandanagar: A&#x301;nanda Ma&#x301;rga Praca&#x301;raka Sam&#x301;gha, 1979]). If necessary, the reader may consult that book.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Along with the <i>a&#x301;sanas</i> and <i>mudra&#x301;s,</i> a list of some free or inexpensive and easily-available, but proven and useful, medicinal remedies, as well as the methods of their application, has been given in this book. The public can make use of these applications by themselves, or, if needed, may consult experienced <i>a&#x301;ca&#x301;ryas</i> in this respect also.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Due to limitations of time, it is not possible for me to enter into personal correspondence with anybody. Any person having questions regarding the <i>a&#x301;sanas</i> and <i>mudra&#x301;s</i> and their performance, or the medicines and their applications, may contact their respective <i>a&#x301;ca&#x301;rya,</i> or may get in touch with the secretary of their local village or district committee or of the Central Committee of Ananda Marga.

<a name="6..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Belching with a bad smell, watering of the mouth, distension of the stomach, loss of appetite, aversion to food, offensive internal gas, physical weakness, fretful temper, constipation or loose stool containing food particles.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..3"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Causes<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->When we take food it is converted into a juicy mass with the help of digestive fluids, then it is transformed into blood. Blood is the most important substance in the body. Fruits, roots, leafy green vegetables and other alkaline-type foods, after being digested, preserve the vitality of the blood by increasing its alkaline portion, whereas fatty and carbohydrate-type foods increase the acidity of the blood. If there occurs a disproportionate increase in the acidity of the blood, then the spleen, liver, heart, kidneys, etc., which are our blood-purifying organs, come under too much pressure. As a result, these organs, being over-worked in purifying the blood, become gradually so weak that they ultimately fail to do their task properly.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Since the different kinds of juicy fruits can be sufficiently digested in their own fluids, the liver bile does not have to make much effort to digest them. But in order to digest starches and carbohydrates, the saliva of the mouth must help at the preliminary stage. Chewing food brings an adequate quantity of saliva into the mouth. No sooner does the food mixed with saliva enter the stomach than the liver and the pancreas are enabled to start secreting their bile and digestive fluids. So unless food is chewed well, the liver can never function properly.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->If the quantity of non-vegetarian food is large, then the internal organs will ultimately become weak due to the increasing acidity of the blood. Then when the food from the stomach, having already been partially digested by fluid from the liver, enters the duodenal canal, the weak pancreas will be incapable of secreting enough of its digestive fluid. As a result, the partially digested food does not become completely converted into rasa [chyle]. In consequence, the partially digested food gradually decomposes inside the duodenum and thereby partially blocks the intestine. This spoiled food creates a poisonous gas in the body which the respiratory system fails to purify. It also increases the acidic contents of the blood to an excessive degree. This state of health is called &ldquo;indigestion&rdquo; or &ldquo;dyspepsia&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Although dyspepsia is not itself fatal, it can be the cause of several fatal diseases. And in social life, dyspepsia aggravates peoples&#146; acrimonious tendencies and makes them extremely irritable. Stomach, intestinal and rectal ulcers, constipation and serious dysentery may arise from dyspepsia.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="6..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Dyspepsia originates from unbalanced food habits. Eating when one is not hungry or only half hungry is harmful in this disease. So is eating rich food for days together, using intoxicants, eating tasty food out of greed alone, not taking rest after the meal before running off to the office, or taking a bellyful of food (according to the scriptures, it is desirable to fill the stomach halfway with food, one quarter with water, and to keep one quarter empty for free movement of air); refraining from doing physical labour and, over and above this, doing strenuous mental work or indulging in sex, is also harmful in this disease.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->It is better not to eat breakfast or any afternoon snack till the disease is fully cured. However, if one feels hungry, one can have some sweet or sour juicy fruit, particularly of sub-acid type, such as mango, pineapple, <i>ja&#x301;m,</i> any kind of citrus fruit (though citrus fruits belong to the acidic group, their action on the body is alkaline), or, in case of constipation, papaya. It is important to remember that acidic foods such as lemon and curd (yoghurt) should be taken with a little water and salt.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->All non-vegetarian types of food except for small fish, are harmful for dyspepsia patients. Meat and eggs are poison. All intoxicants aggravate constipation, hence they are not to be taken either.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->With dyspepsia it is very essential to take a walk in the fresh air and to do a little physical labour every day. Sleeping in the daytime and staying awake at night are forbidden. It is better to take the evening meal before 8 p.m., and a short walk thereafter is very helpful.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="7..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->When undigested food or accumulated and vitiated stool starts building up pressure, or the offensive internal gas caused by them puts a severe strain on the intestine, the intestine gets dislodged from its normal position, open a hold in the abdominal wall, and protrudes through it. This condition is called &ldquo;hernia&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->If the dislodged intestine comes out through an opening left in the canal to the scrotum, it is called &ldquo;inguinal hernia&rdquo;. When it pushes out through the hole in the canal of nerve fibres and the muscular network controlling the legs, it is called a &ldquo;femoral hernia&rdquo;. Occasionally it pushes out through the navel opening of children, and this is called an &ldquo;umbilical hernia&rdquo;. As long as it is possible to push the protruded intestine back inside or to pull it back into position temporarily through suction, this condition, through painful, does not become fatal. But if the protruded intestine becomes hard like a rope and obstructs then normal functioning of the lower anatomy, then the disease can be said to have reached the critical stage. When the protruded intestine becomes trapped in the opening, causing severe suffering to the patient, then it is called a &ldquo;strangulated hernia&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..4"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Causes<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Food enters the stomach and there gets partially digested. It then passes into the duodenum (upper intestine) for complete digestion. Too much non-vegetarian and fatty food aggravates the acidity of the blood. As a result, different hormone-secreting glands become weak, and the partially-digested food starts decaying inside the body, creating a foul and poisonous gas which, in turn, puts pressure and strain on the stool-filled intestine and forces its dislodgement. Therefore failure of the liver to digest all the food properly is the main cause of hernia.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="7..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Hernia patients must never completely fill the stomach, in order to prevent pressure on the stomach. It is also desirable to take a small quantity of food a greater number of times, rather than to eat a large amount at one time. Drinking a small amount of water or lemon-water many times a day is also advisable. A hernia patient should also remember to maintain a slight but continuous feeling of hunger. Hernia patients should get out of the habit of straining while defecating.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="9..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Oxygen inhaled in breathing enters the body and eventually turns into carbon dioxide. Through the influence of this carbon dioxide, the digestive fluid-secreting glands are activated. If food is taken irregularly and excessively day after day, or if food is forced down with little or no appetite, or if eating rich food becomes a steady habit, it becomes impossible for the digestive fluid to digest the food properly. Then, just as on the one hand the undigested or partially-digested food turns into poisonous gas, so on the other hand the secreted digestive fluid gradually turns into harmful acid.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The digestive fluids are themselves acidic, but under normal conditions when they digest food they themselves are digested. When, however, as a result of the aforesaid irregularities, they are unable to digest the food, the fluids themselves also remain undigested.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->The cause of acidity, therefore, is the poisonous gas being produced by the decomposed food, together with the putrid acid produced by the deterioration of the undigested fluids.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->The putrid acidic gas and fluids cause a burning sensation in the stomach. When they rise up to the chest they cause heartburn; when they reach the throat, burning is felt in the throat; when they rise further they cause dizziness.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Due to this excessive acidity, the blood becomes acid-dominated. Being overworked, the blood-purifying organs of the body also become weak, and the patient feels weak.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->This over-acidity of the blood also causes swelling and consequent pain in different parts of the body, especially the joints. The name of this condition is &ldquo;rheumatism&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="9..16"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Dos and don&#146;ts<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->For patients of acidity it is particularly important to walk in the open air, to eat less food than the appetite demands, and to drink plenty of water, in small amounts, at intervals throughout the day. Coconut and coconut-based foods and medicines are especially useful in this disease. Patients should refrain from eating breakfast and snacks. If the hunger is unbearable, the patient may eat a little bit of juicy fruit. A frequent symptom of this disease is that, due to old habits, the digestive glands discharge an excessive quantity of fluids, as a result of which the patient suddenly feels an extreme hunger at odd times, which is called &ldquo;demon hunger&rdquo;. That is why we find that a patient who is often in a depressed mood about his/her disease or goes around talking about the disease to everyone, when he/she sits down to eat, eats excessively. This symptom is the result of the secretion of digestive fluids at a particular time in accordance with the old habits of the patient. It is therefore desirable to be cautious about this &ldquo;demon&rdquo;, detrimental hunger. An acidity patient should never violate these dos and don&#146;ts.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->If due to the over-secretion of digestive fluids the patient suffers from &ldquo;demon hunger&rdquo;, it can be relieved by drinking a large glass of water. When the acidity patient feels pain, it is advisable to drink orange or tangerine juice mixed in tepid water. After the pain has subsided, lemon juice in cold water should be taken. As with dyspepsia, during mealtime and for an hour thereafter breath should be flowing through the patient&#146;s right nostril.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->At the time of severe colic pain, the dominant flow of breath should be changed from the nostril through which it was flowing at the time the pain started to the other nostril. Allowing the bile to accumulate by not taking something when one is hungry should never be permitted, because in that event the undigested bile itself will become the cause of acidity.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="10..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->It is not possible to achieve a permanent cure by removing the developed piles through surgery or through stopping the bleeding by any method, because if the root causes are not eliminated, the disease may attack again at any moment, or the contaminated gas and blood in the body may cause some other disease. Therefore, though it may not be improper to employ some temporary expedient to stop severe bleeding at the critical stage, the liver has to be restored in order to obtain a permanent cure.

<a name="10..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->The patient has to be careful to have a sharp appetite at noon. With piles all extra-alkaline food must be carefully avoided. It is desirable for the patients to avoid eating plantain spathe, plantain flower, plantain fruit or <i>meoya&#x301;</i> fruit. At the critical stage of the disease fasting is always recommended. During fasting, plenty of water, and, if desired, sweet or sour citrus juices mixed in water may be consumed.

But if this loose movement does not take its natural course, then those materials start to decompose inside the colon in an ugly way, and begin to decay the mucous membrane. Under those circumstances, the different fluid-secreting glands of the body engage in secreting more fluids in an effort to rectify the internal disorder. When these extra fluids come into contact with the undigested food and other contaminated matter, they turn into mucus. So in a case of dysentery the stool is full of mucus. The mucus is no disease by itself but is a natural system of healing the disease.<!-- /block --></p>

<div class=book_chapter_info_top></div>

<a name="12..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->This disease has been found in India only in recent times. A few centuries ago it entered India from Europe. Many are of the opinion that syphilis first originated in dogs, and through contact with them the human body got infected.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..2"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Symptoms<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->In the first stage the disease will appear in some part of the body, especially on the genital organs, as chancres. The surface around the chancres is quite hard. Generally there is no secretion of pus or fluid from these chancres. Then chancroid usually appears in the groin. In most cases these chancres and the chancroid dry up or heal within a short time. In this stage many people cannot recognize the disease for sure as syphilis, because not all boils are in fact syphilitic chancres and not all swelling of the groin (swelling of a gland in the groin) is chancroid.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->In the second stage of the disease, sores of different forms, small or big according to the type of the disease, erupt on the body, and these sores start secreting fluids of different colours and displaying different symptoms. Syphilis which erupts due to disturbance of the va&#x301;yu is called &ldquo;<i>va&#x301;yu</i> syphilis.&rdquo; The sores of this type of syphilis are black in colour and cause piercing pain, throbbing and twinging. When the disease erupts in a body which has already been suffering from vitiation of the pitta, it is called &ldquo;<i>pitta</i> syphilis.&rdquo; Its sores are yellowish in colour, very ugly and dirty in appearance, and usually generate a sharp burning sensation. Similarly, when the kapha has gone bad, the disease is called &ldquo;<i>kapha</i> syphilis.&rdquo; In this disease, the mucus is a white colour, and the sores are bigger in size, produce profuse secretions and cause mainly itching sensations. The disease produced by the blood going bad is known as &ldquo;blood syphilis.&rdquo; Its sores are copperish or reddish in color and give out red secretions. When general disruption of <i>va&#x301;yu, pitta</i> and <i>kapha,</i> all three, occurs, the syphilis is called &ldquo;<i>tridos&#x301;aja</i> syphilis.&rdquo; In this type all the above symptoms are found in greater or lesser degree.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Even though syphilis and chancroid are closely related, and their causes and symptoms are more or less the same, they are two different diseases. It is not a fact that syphilis must cause swelling of the groin; the symptoms of chancroid as an independent disease are the swelling of the groin, the ripening of the swelling, and sores on different parts of the body, especially the sexual organs. The medical name of the syphilis germ is <i>Spirillum pallida</i> [<i>Treponema pallidum</i>], and that of the chancroid germ is <i>Bacillus ducre</i>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..6"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Causes<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Not keeping the sexual organs clean, excessive copulation, and contact with syphilitic men and women are the causes of this disease. Syphilis is generally widespread among prostitutes due to their promiscuous sexual activities, and from them healthy men get the infection. So it may generally be judged that syphilis has an inseparable relationship with bad character.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->This disease can be transmitted to a healthy person through excessive association with syphilitic persons, using their clothing, eating their leftover food, or engaging in sexual relations with them. But the disease is not normally transmitted by mere association and eating together.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="12..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->With syphilis, non-vegetarian food, onion, garlic, too much spice, all kinds of sweets, and milk products are to be strictly avoided. All types of alkaline foods and foods prepared with ghee are good. At lunch, it is good to take rice with ghee, and in the evening, <i>rut&#x301;i</i>. Vegetable soup and fruits and roots can be eaten in ample quantity. The patient should drink enough water every day. It is good not to take milk till the disease is cured, but one can take milk in increasing quantity as the disease heals.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="12..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->A sun-bath should be taken every day at a fixed time in summer and winter, exposing the diseased parts of the body to the sun. The sores should be carefully washed with the juice of neem [<i>Azadirachta indica A. Juss</i>] leaves, or any other disinfectant lotion, on a regular daily basis, after which neem oil should be applied. Among the many processes for washing the sores, one of the best is to apply a finely-ground <i>girima&#x301;ti</i> [red ochre] on the sores and to cover them with a wet cloth. The cloth should be soaked in water frequently. After doing this for an hour or an hour and a half, remove the <i>girima&#x301;ti</i> and the cloth. In this way the sores will have a thorough cleansing.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Remember that it is injurious to health to suppress the secretion of fluid, blood or pus of any skin sores by external application of medicines. So in the preliminary stage of the disease, no external ointments should be used.

<a name="13..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Cancer is a disease of the whole body as well as a <i>tridos&#x301;aja</i> disease [involving disturbances of <i>va&#x301;yu, pitta</i> and <i>kapha</i>]. This disease is a combined effect of many different factors. It is ordinarily observed that persons who suffer from constipation as a result of violating the health rules, and who likewise are lazy, lack self-restraint, sleep during the day and keep late nights, are most likely to be attacked by cancer.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->When due to constipation, the blood and the muscle-fibre become worn out by the contaminated digestive fluids of the body and the contaminated air produced by them, cancer sets in. Parts of the internal organs of people who are extremely self-indulgent become weak. As a result of the attrition of <i>shukra,</i> their body loses its vitality. When such people eat too large a quantity of non-vegetarian food, their blood turns acidic and the disease gradually breaks out in the weaker parts of their bodies.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->With those people who shun physical labour but take acidic food, chillies, or intoxicants and especially tobacco and similar things &ndash; there is every possibility that the disease will attack.<!-- /block --></p>

If the liver is bad, the patient should drink coconut milk, peanut milk or curd-water instead of cow&#146;s milk. The evening meal should be finished before 8 p.m. Also the patient should let the breath flow through the right nostril for about an hour after each main meal. The patient should drink about two-and-a-half seers of water every day but never more than one-eighth seer at a time. Pineapple, <i>ja&#x301;m,</i> banana, all kinds of citrus fruits, and tomato are both food and medicine in this disease.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="13..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->It is very good for cancer patients to take sun-baths. A sun-bath should be taken at sunrise and also between 9 and 10-11 a.m. in the summer or between 9 a.m. and 12 noon in the winter. After the sun-bath, the whole body of the patient should be wiped with a wet towel. Excellent results can be obtained if the patient applies river mud all over the body every day and afterwards bathes in the river. Sleeping during the day, staying awake at night, chillies, non-vegetarian food, and sexual relations are to be strictly avoided. Walking in open places as the strength allows, and, for those who are lazy by nature, doing some physical labour, are also necessary. Eating a piece of myrobalan after a meal is always helpful to clear the bowels. Patients should go to bed every night by 8:30 or 9 p.m so that they may get up very early the next morning.<!-- /block --></p>

If this is not available either, a wet towel can be used, soaking it repeatedly in water. Fill the bathtub with cold water, and sit in it undressed so that the area from the navel down remains submerged. Keep your feet dry and out of the tub. The area from the neck to the navel should be kept covered with a shirt or dry cloth. The crown of the head and the back of the head should be kept covered with a wet towel.<br> Now take another towel and rub the area from the right side of the abdomen to the groin seven or eight times. Do likewise on the left-hand side and horizontally from right to left and left to right. You should make sure that the towel on the head remains wet.<br> After this, wipe the abdomen, hands and thighs and take a full bath. If this is not possible, then leave the tub wearing a shirt.<br> This should be practised behind closed doors. In the absence of a bathtub or an earthen trough, a wet towel may be wrapped around the areas to be bathed, but in order to compensate, cold water must be poured constantly over the towel, and the towel which is to be used for the massage must be kept wet. After <i>vya&#x301;paka sna&#x301;na,</i> the thighs, pubic area and abdomen should be warmed with a dry towel.<br> Before and after this bath one should not eat, in order to allow the stomach to rest.<br> &ndash;Trans.]]</p>

<a name="14..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Leprosy comes about due to the disturbance of the seven constituent elements of the body. In other words, leprosy develops only when all seven elements of the body, that is, the chyle, blood, flesh, fat, bone, marrow and <i>shukra</i> are defective.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Leprosy has three stages. In the first stage the patient starts getting a feeling of discomfort all over the body, suffers from pain in the joints, and feels feverish at odd times.

<a name="14..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->In the second stage the patient feels piercing pain throughout the nervous system. Off and on small pimples come out on different parts of the body. Hair of the head and eyebrows falls out; parts of the lips, cheeks, nose and eyes become sunken or swollen. Various parts of the arms and legs also get swollen. While walking the patient sometimes feels as if some hard objects are lodging in the soles of the feet. In colloquial language this stage of the disease is called &ldquo;plum-stone disease&rdquo;, that is, the patient feels as if plum-stones are getting lodged in the soles.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->In the third stage of the disease circular red spots appear on different parts of the body and gradually those places become numb.<!-- /block --></p>

If in the long and bitter struggle which ensues between the white blood cells and the leprosy bacteria, the fat, flesh, blood and chyle of the body become spent, as a final result the extremities of the body will also become loosened and start falling off.<!-- /block --></p>

If out of misguided love parents treat their children lavishly by feeding them ghee, butter, fish, meat and eggs right from baby-hood, or if due to poverty or due to some belief they feed their children non-vegetarian foods or spicy vegetable preparations instead of milk, fruits, roots, and other foods appropriate for children, then the livers and other digestive organs of their children, being overworked, lose their vitality and the children become thin.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="15..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->In the case of children under five, milk, fruits and roots should be their main food. The less starches, carbohydrates and fatty foods the better, because such foods weaken the undeveloped liver and digestive organs of children. Under no circumstances should children under five years be fed non-vegetarian food. From that age on, starches, carbohydrates and fatty foods may be given in gradually increasing amounts. But fruits and roots and all kinds of alkaline food are always the best diet for children. Due to poverty many parents cannot provide much milk for their children, though they require at least three-fourths seer to one seer every day.<!-- /block --></p>

Such a mentality is very injurious to their children.<!-- /block --></p>

That is why this disease is worse and more harmful than leucoderma, or white leprosy. When, due to weakness of the blood (this weakness is causes in most if not all cases by an attack of dysentery, particularly when this disease has been suppressed by application of some astringent medicine), the skin, flesh and fat become weak and their immune systems lose their strength, the germs of eczema are enabled to settle in a person&#146;s body. As a result of the continuous combat between the white blood cells and the eczema germs, the dead white cells and germs start oozing out of the body in the form of pus, or together with fluids or blood. The patient then suffers from continuous agony, because the exudation of the pus, fluid and blood actually starts deep inside the body.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="18..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The brain is the apparent controller of the body and its organs. With the help of afferent and efferent nerves, the brain receives impulses from and transmits them to all parts of the body. This nerve centre of the brain is again, broadly speaking, divided into two parts, the right and the left. The nervous system of the right side of the brain controls the left portion of the anatomy and that of the left side of the brain controls the right portion. If due to high blood pressure or some other cause any portion of the brain&#146;s nervous system becomes damaged, the part of the body controlled by that portion of the nervous system also becomes inoperative. This inoperativeness of a particular part of the body is called &ldquo;paralysis&rdquo; or &ldquo;palsy&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..2"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Causes<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Each specific part of the brain receives one specific impulse with the help of the afferent nerves. If, on account of high blood pressure or some injury, that portion of the brain becomes damaged; or the nerve-cells or nerve fibres are severed; or the afferent nerves of any part of the body become defective; then the afferent nerves cannot transmit the afferent sensation to the mind. This defect or shattered state of the nerves is the cause of loss of movement of the limbs. Similarly, if the nervous system which transmits the commands of the brain becomes damaged, or if the efferent nerves of that system develop any defect, then, as a result of the breakdown in the nervous transmission between the brain and some part of the body, paralysis strikes that part of the body.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->In this regard, bear in mind that when the brain cells which receive or transmit a specific physical impulse or mental concept become defective, only the corresponding physical organs will become paralysed or corresponding conceptual area will be impaired. That is why it may be observed that a person who was learned in both English and Sanskrit may, due to an attack of mental paralysis [memory loss], forget all the Sanskrit he or she knew, but keep his/her knowledge of English intact. Nor is it the case that paralysis will always affect the whole right or the whole left side of the body. Owing to the reasons described earlier, an attack of paralysis can be limited to any particular limb &ndash; right or left. For instance, the right eye can be affected while the left eye remains normal, or the right side of the mouth may be paralysed whereas the other side is not.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The root causes of blood pressure-related diseases and paralysis are almost the same. This is because most defects of the nerves and their degeneration, can be traced to high blood pressure. But paralysis can also arise from other causes. For instance, paralysis also strikes those whose blood is over-acidic, and whose nerve-fibres consequently degenerate, due to greed, overeating, or too much fondness for non-vegetarian food.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->The people who have an over-active <i>man&#x301;ipura cakra</i> [psychic-energy centre located at the navel) also show a dominance of the lust and anger vrttis [mental propensities]. Such a type of person, though always found to be energetic, generally suffers from constipation owing to excessive anger and over-activity. If these <i>pitta</i>-dominated persons do not find a high ideal in their lives, they become weak in their lower bodies due to over-indulgence in sex and anger. Often the nerve-fibres of their lower bodies degenerate, and paralysis sets in there. If these <i>pitta</i>-dominated persons do have a high ideal in their lives and develop paralysis, it will afflict the upper portion of their bodies because of the over activeness of those parts.<!-- /block --></p>

A sun-bath should be taken at a fixed time in summer and in winter. The patient should first take a sun-bath over the whole body, then, wiping off with a wet towel, should again take a sun-bath &ndash; this time exposing the diseased area only. After exposing the diseased area to the sun a few times in this manner for about fifteen or twenty minutes each time, the last step is to give that area a thorough massage, either with or without oil.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="19..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Indigestion and constipation, aversion to food, nausea after meals, and pain in the stomach immediately or one or two hours after taking food, are the symptoms of this disease.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..3"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Causes<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Partially-digested food or its juice passes from the stomach into the duodenum or upper intestine for further assimilation. There the digestive fluids with the help of bile from the liver and digestive juices from the pancreas accomplish the task of digestion. But if, owing to defective working of these organs, the food is not completely digested here either, then it becomes spoiled and vitiated. At the same time, the unassimilated digestive fluids and bile also become spoiled and create an adverse reaction in the system. This spoiled digestive fluid and bile is the cause of gastric and duodenal ulcers. Habitually undertaking mental or physical exertion after a meal without having any rest slows down the blood circulation in the walls of the stomach and duodenum, due to which the membrane lining of the organs becomes easily susceptible to the acidic poison; and the ulcer appears.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->If the acid-secreting organs of the body have to remain constantly active in order to digest non-vegetarian foods, or if, owing to constipation, dyspepsia or any other disease, the alkaline secreting glands become weak, then the alkaline secretions in the body cannot maintain a balance with the acids, and these extremely poisonous acidic fluids then go on with their work unimpeded. Wherever this excess acidic fluid gets an opportunity to accumulate, gradually an ulcer forms. In the stomach, in the duodenum, or wherever these fluids attack the membrane or the lining, they create wounds and there ulcers are formed &ndash; gastric (stomach) ulcers, duodenal ulcers and other types of ulcers.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->If the blood loses its vitality due to excessive mental exertion coupled with a lack of physical labour; or due to the use of very strong and poisonous medicines (poisons are often used in large quantity in the form of medicines to destroy the germs of blood disease); or due to taking injections of poisonous medicines to cure or to prevent disease; or due to an unrestrained life; that weak blood makes the membrane of the duodenum weak and unable to fight the accumulated acidity, and it becomes ulcerated. If the ulcer is in the stomach, the patient suffers pain immediately after eating. But if that ulcer forms inside the duodenum, the pain starts after a short while but not immediately. In this case the pain originates to the right of the navel. With gastric ulcers, the consumed food has less opportunity inside the body to be digested, and therefore the patient becomes thin and worn out. But with duodenal ulcers, the change takes a long time to show externally.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Whatever may be the reason, if an ulcer is formed inside the body, blood oozing out of the wound tries to find an outlet and is emitted through vomiting, or through the anus or the urinary passage. That is why the patient feels nauseated when suffering from acute stomach or duodenal ulcers, and after vomiting always gets some relief. Often slightly darkish blood comes out with the vomiting [haematemesis]. In a severe state of the disease the stool of the patient also appears blackish. Even when the disease is not in the severe state, the stool comes out in pellets and a darkish colour. This disease generally attacks people in early youth and kills them at the end of youth or in middle age.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="19..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->In the severe state of the disease nothing except plenty of water and sweet or sour fruit juice should be taken. When blood is vomited, the patient should be fed <i>durba&#x301;</i> juice or <i>kuksima&#x301;</i>-leaf extracts only. When the patient is a little better, he or she should be given a small quantity of diluted milk with honey to drink. So long as the stool remain darkish, the patient should be given only different kinds of fruit juice, sweet or sour; the filtered juice of ripe tomatoes; the juice of any sweet citrus fruit; or well-boiled potatoes thoroughly mashed with diluted milk.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->After the severe state of the disease has passed, the patient may eat soup or stew made out of potatoes, <i>pat&#x301;ol, jhim&#x301;ge, dhundula</i> or similar easily-digestible vegetables, along with boiled old rice (grains a few years old), etc. In this state, a small amount of pure, warm ghee should be taken with rice or fresh <i>rut&#x301;i</i>. So long as even a vestige of the disease persists the patient should never eat much at a time. Instead, food should be eaten several times a day, eating only a small quantity each time. The cure of this disease depends largely on the selection of diet &ndash; therefore, even after getting well, the patient should observe the dietary provisions strictly for a couple of years.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="19..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Acidity is the main cause of this disease, so it is desirable that food which can increase acidity be carefully avoided. An ulcer patient must give up non-vegetarian food and all types of intoxicants. Food which would stimulate or irritate the stomach should also be forsaken; extra-sweet, hot (spicy) and salty foods are unwholesome for an ulcer patient. Once the patient gets well, he or she will find alkaline food best. But it is better not to take fibrous food even after a complete cure. After normal health has been restored, the patient should include in the diet spinach, <i>beto sha&#x301;k, mat&#x301;ar sha&#x301;k</i> or jute leaves to help clear the bowels and to prevent the vomiting of blood. As a medicine, <i>shushuni sha&#x301;k</i> fried in ghee is also excellent. All ulcer patients must take daily at least two or three spoonfuls of honey mixed with water or milk. Habitually doing physical or mental work without taking rest after meals is most harmful.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="20..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The liver of the human being is a very important gland. The secretion of bile, the transformation of chyle into blood, and the purification of the blood, are all done by the liver. The bile secreted from the liver is first stored in the gall-bladder, and from there it is sent to the stomach and to the upper intestine. The impurities of the blood and the chyle are also sent into the stomach along with bile, and from there they pass through the intestine into the rectum and are emitted from the body as waste. If the impurities are too great in proportion to the chyle and the blood, especially if the acids are too great, these things are carried with the bile into the gall-bladder in very large quantity. And when the bile settles in the gall bladder, these impurities accumulate in a condensed form and gradually crystallize. In this way stones of different sizes and shapes are formed in the gall-bladder. When, after a meal, those stones block the bile-duct, the body&#146;s organs apply great force to push the stones out into the stomach or intestine. This application of force causes pain.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="21..1"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Symptoms<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Inflammation of different glands and their surrounding areas, with simultaneous throbbing pain (this does not mean that pain will accompany the swelling in every case; and in chronic cases it is natural for there to be no pain); occasional fever, and aggravation of the swelling during the fever, are the symptoms of this disease.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..3"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Causes<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->1. The liver and the spleen become weak due to chronic fever, and as a result, the immune defenses of the blood and lymph become diminished. When this happens, the glands of the body do not get the necessary support from them, and the gland or glands which are neglected most have to strain to continue their activity. Because of this over-exertion, the glands start swelling and enlarging.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->2. Lack of iodine in the food causes those glands which need iodine to become weak, and in that condition they eventually become swollen.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->3. If the body becomes deficient in <i>shukra,</i> the last-derived of all the bodily elements, due to the wasteful discharge of semen, all the glands lose their vitality, because it is the <i>shukra</i> which helps the glands stay strong and healthy.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Some of the important glands need <i>shukra</i> and iodine more than others, and therefore any deficiency is more detrimental to them. The thyroid gland of the throat is one such gland, so it easily succumbs to attack for any of the causes mentioned above. The two main supporting arteries of the thyroid, named <i>manya,</i> also become incapable of carrying out their normal functions and start swelling. As a consequence the whole region starts swelling and enlarging. The name of this disease is &ldquo;goitre&rdquo;. This type of swelling may also occur at the base of the ears, in the armpits and in the groin.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..8"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Treatment<!-- /block --></p>

The patient has to observe carefully the procedures for sun-bathing, drinking water and fasting (see Appendix.)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..11"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Diet<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->With this disease, iodine-containing foods such as milk and fruit should be taken in sufficient quantity. Bananas, papayas, pineapples, oranges, tangerines, <i>ja&#x301;m</i> and tomatoes are very good food for patients. The patient must also pay careful attention to the regular clearance of the bowels.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..13"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Dos and don&#146;ts<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->This type of disease, involving glandular swelling, is found on a larger scale in the interior part of a country than in its sea-coast regions. So if it is possible for a patient to go to some sea-coast place for a change of air, it will yield a good result. Since there is a lot of iodine in sea water, the air near the coast is always found to be full of iodine.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Excessive seminal loss, in the case of the male, may cause the thyroid gland to swell, so one should be careful to preserve one&#146;s semen.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Women who have given birth to a large number of children, or who are having menstrual trouble, especially excessive bleeding, or who have breast-fed their children excessively, may also be affected by swelling of the thyroid gland.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->There is not much to fear if the swelling has only been present for a short time, because taking precautionary measures in the preliminary stage will keep this disease from becoming incurable. But if the disease persists and turns chronic, the above-mentioned dos and don&#146;ts will have to be faithfully observed for a long period.<!-- /block --></p>

<div class=book_chapter_info_top></div>

<a name="22..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->This disease has no name in ancient Sanskrit. Because of its many similarities with urethritis (<i>meha</i>), this disease has been called <i>prameha</i> in Bengali. But the English word, &ldquo;gonorrhoea&rdquo;, is more commonly used.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..2"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Symptoms<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Burning sensation while urinating; the head of the penis swelling and becoming blood-red; passing of urine drop by drop or with a white or yellowish coloration; seminal discharge of a white colour at first and yellowish in the later stage of the disease; sores around the head of the penis or inside the urinary passage; the penis swelling and becoming hard, etc.; are the indications of gonorrhoea.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..4"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Causes<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->According to medical practitioners, this disease is spread by a bacteria called &ldquo;gonococcus.&rdquo; This disease originates with those males or females who are habitually unrestrained and unclean. And those who come in physical contact with such males and females also contract the disease. This disease is contracted by males from prostitutes, and innocent women may in turn be affected through physical contact with those males.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Generally speaking, before this disease is clearly expressed, patients suffer from tickling or itching sensations inside the urinary tract or inside the vagina. And if the patient scratches or in some way manipulates or rubs the genitals, he or she will feel a hot sensation and at the same time some temporary relief.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..7"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Treatment<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->The same as for syphilis.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="22..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->All nutritious foods that do not cause constipation can be eaten. Drinking of water and lemon juice in sufficient quantity is recommended, and the fasting rules must be observed carefully. Overeating, using intoxicating items, and eating non-vegetarian food should be carefully avoided. The buds, stems, and leaves of <i>ucche, palta&#x301;,</i> neem [<i>Azadirachta indica A. juss.</i>] and <i>sajne</i> (also flowers) are very good for this disease.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="22..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Though not fatal, gonorrhoea is more harmful than its simple fatality record, because it gradually poisons the life of the entire society. It is not easy to get complete cure from gonorrhoea. This disease sometimes remains latent for a long time, and a little intemperance will make it surface again. Therefore gonorrhoea patients should observe <i>naes&#x301;t&#x301;hika Brahmacarya</i> [strict abstinence from sexual intercourse] for a long period of time, to avoid having blind or deformed offspring. Even after achieving a complete cure from the disease, strict continence must be maintained for at least three years.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->If pus from this illness somehow gets into the eyes, it may destroy the eyesight. So the hands should be washed with soap if they have been contaminated with the pus. The diseased area should be exposed to the rays of the sun after taking a regular bath. If the pain becomes unbearable, soak the genital organ in alum-water as hot as can be endured. For relief from pain, the penis can also be covered with a pack of yellow clay, leaving the urinary passage open. The clay pack can be intermittently replaced by a fresh one, throwing away the old pack as soon as it has dried up.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Gonorrhoea generates an unbearable burning pain in the genital organ &ndash; often with stoppage of urine or passing of urine mixed with blood.

<a name="22..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->8. Drink 10 drops of sandal oil in water.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="22..30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->4.

<a name="22..31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->5. Take 5 tolas of water in which 8 to 10 leaves of red java&#x301; [china rose &ndash; <i>Hibiscus rosa-sinensis Linn.</i>] have been mashed until the water has become reddish, then strain out the leaves and take it with sugar as a drink, in order to relieve the disease.<!-- /block --></p>

Amongst the pancreatic juices, one secretion helps in the digestion of food, and another separates the sugar content from non-vegetarian and starchy types of food. The sugar is then stored in a particular section of the liver and according to body requirements it is dissolved to generate heat and vital power to run the body mechanism. Chronic indigestion, constipation (here also the stool usually turns into pellets), mental exertion without any physical labour, use of intoxicants, and excessive seminal waste &ndash; all weaken the vitality of the liver. When such weakening takes place, the sugar contents of the food, failing to find a storage place in the liver, are assimilated into the blood and gradually accumulate. As a result, the blood gets polluted and loses its immune properties to a great extent. The natural reaction of the body in such a situation is to try to purify the blood by separating out its sugar content and expelling it with the urine. To dissolve the sugar, the human body needs plenty of water, and that is why diabetes patients suffer from a continuous thirst. Sugar emitted with the urine in a large quantity gradually reduces the vital energy of diabetes patients.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="23..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->As diabetes is basically a disease of liver and pancreas, care has to be taken to keep these organs in a healthy state, and to do so patients must select food that will keep their bowels clear, yet which is nutritious and easily digestible. All types of fruits are good for this disease, especially ripe bananas. Non-vegetarian food must never be eaten. Vegetable proteins are also acidic, hence they are to be eaten as sparingly as possible. It is therefore advisable to reduce the intake of rice and <i>rut&#x301;i</i> (made of wheat flour) and instead to use more foods such as vegetable soup, plantain soup, <i>pat&#x301;ol, okra, dhundula, palta&#x301;, la&#x301;u</i> [<i>Lagenaria vulgaris Seringe</i>], plantain spathes and flowers, figs, etc., which contain alkaline properties.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="23..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Diabetes is the disease of intellectuals. Those who do physical labour seldom suffer from this disease. Undergoing mental exertion, remaining indoors for a long period, physical laziness, constipation, intemperance, etc., are reasons for the contraction of diabetes. As has already been said, diabetes is basically connected with the liver and the pancreas, hence only those foods should be selected which do not over-stimulate those vital organs. Similarly, work and exercise which will help to bring these organs into their normal state of health must be pursued more and more. For those who are adverse to physical labour, a cure from diabetes is next to impossible.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->The human body also needs the nutrients offered by starchy and non-vegetarian types of food; therefore foods which are not acidic but rather alkaline, yet contain those nutrients, should be taken in greater quantity to meet those needs. This will include coconut, peanuts, curd (yogurt), bananas, etc. A drink of peanut extract and water without sugar and with little or no honey is ideal as both food and medicine for this disease.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="23..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Generally diabetes patients are a bit greedy, and sometimes they eat too much sweetened food, which brings on the disease.

<a name="23..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Sometimes sugar is completely absent in the urine. In this respect one has to remember that sugar may be found temporarily in the urine if the urinary bladder, kidney or some other internal organ is subjected to a blow. If in such cases insulin is given, it will actually harm the patient. Under such circumstances the best thing to do would be to treat the injury of the concerned organ appropriately, and then the urine of the patient will automatically become sugar-free.<!-- /block --></p>

The prescribed procedure for sun-bathing should be carefully followed, that is, exposing the particular limb or the entire body to the sun for fifteen to twenty minutes at a stretch at the time fixed for summer or winter months (see Appendix).

<a name="26..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Swelling of the scrotum, swelling and stiffening of the supporting ligaments and the blood vessels of the testicles, throbbing pain in the abdomen and in the scrotum, swelling of the scrotum due to accumulation of water, etc., are symptoms of this disease.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26..3"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Causes<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Generally there are two possible causes for this disease: (1) internal, and (2) external.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->(1) In different parts of the body there are glands which act as storage places for <i>shukra</i>. In these glands the life-carrying spermatozoa are produced from the <i>shukra</i>. A male&#146;s testicles are such <i>shukra</i>-producing glands.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->When a man&#146;s mind is subjected to lustful thinking or any sort of sexual passion, his testicles are stirred into action very quickly and start producing spermatozoa. The spermatozoa are then channelled along with the seminal fluid to their ultimate storage sacs. During intercourse or nocturnal emission, spermatozoa are emitted from the body in the semen. If, however, the semen cannot find an outlet for some reason or if its flow is unnaturally obstructed, then the semen becomes decomposed in the storage sacks. If under such circumstances a particular patient is found suffering from any kind of <i>pitta</i> defect, constipation, etc., which has already weakened his blood and his lower anatomy, then the decomposing semen becomes watery and the person suffers an attack of hydrocele. His testicles start swelling very slowly, and ultimately the swelling becomes permanent.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->(2) Due to too much leaping about without wearing a <i>kaopiina</i> [<i>laungot&#x301;a&#x301;,</i> a tight-fitting kind of underwear], or due to a sudden blow, the testes, along with their supporting ligaments and their blood vessels, may get swollen. This results in enlargement of the testicles and allows accumulation of fluids in them to form a hydrocele.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->If people who do not take a dip bath [i.e., who splash water or shower without fully immersing themselves] also bathe in a standing position, the lower abdomen and back may remain completely dry. This dryness may irritate the nervous system and invite an attack of hydrocele.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="26..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Morning &ndash; <i>Utksepa Mudra, Vasti Mudra, Vasti Kumbhaka, A&#x301;mbhasii Mudra&#x301;</i> or <i>A&#x301;mbhasii Pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;ya&#x301;ma, Sarva&#x301;un&#x32D;ga&#x301;sana</i> and <i>Gomukha&#x301;sana</i>.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="26..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Whenever an opportunity arises, the patient should perform vasti kumbhaka on an empty stomach. Rules of bathing and of drinking water should also be followed strictly.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="26..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->If the condition of the liver permits, all types of nutritious food can be taken. However, a very close watch must be kept on the regular clearing of the bowels. Fast on <i>eka&#x301;dashii, pu&#x301;rn&#x301;ima&#x301;</i> and <i>ama&#x301;vasya&#x301;</i>.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="26..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Sexual thoughts and excitement are among the causes of hydrocele, so the more one can stay away from these things the better. Patients should use <i>kaopiinas</i>. Alternative applications of cold and hot compresses will give quick relief.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->How to apply a compress: Lying in a supine position, apply an ice pack or an ice-cold water compress on the testes for fifteen to twenty minutes at a stretch. After the tissues have become thoroughly cooled, a warm flannel compress should then be applied to the skin for about one or two minutes to bring back its warmth. Again, apply the cold compress for fifteen to twenty minutes, following it with a warm compress as described above. At night, before retiring to bed, alternate cold and hot compresses should be applied a few times in a similar manner. The last compress of the night should be a cold one instead of hot to keep the tissues of the testicles cool for the night.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26..18"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Some remedies<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->1. Wrap the testicles in <i>kadamba</i> leaves; or<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->2. Dissolve ammonium chloride in water and use a wet bandage soaked in that solution; or<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->3. Pound opium and <i>svet candan</i> [white sandal] into paste together and apply the paste on the testicles; or<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->4. Grind leaves of mango, <i>ja&#x301;m, kayetbel</i> and lemon together into a paste, and apply it to the testicles, in order to relieve hydrocele.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->5. Apply the root of <i>Brahmayasti</i> or <i>bamunha&#x301;ti</i> ground in the water with which rice has been washed; or<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->6. On any Tuesday, tie a root of a barren <i>kul</i> plant [<i>Zizyphus mauratiana Lamk.</i>] around the waist in such a manner that the root remains dangling down touching the testicles; these remedies will relieve hydrocele.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->7. Good results can also be obtained in a very short time if one ties fibres of <i>bora&#x301;caka</i> leaves around the waist.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="27..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Difficulty in urinating, passing of urine drop by drop instead of in a flow, stoppage of urine, blood in urine, etc., are symptoms of kidney-stones.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="27..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The kidneys are located one on each side of the body, just below the liver and the spleen. When the liver, busy in its manifold duties, is not entirely capable of doing its job of purifying the blood, the remaining work is taken up by the kidneys. The kidneys, after filtering out the wastes and impurities and surplus water of the body, supply pure blood to nourish the body. The surplus water and waste materials are then accumulated in the collecting system of the kidneys and from there are passed on to the bladder. Ultimately these waste fluids are expelled from the body through the urinary tract as urine.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->If the acid content of the blood becomes excessive or if the blood suffers from other poisonous contaminations, this upsets the heart, liver and kidneys. The harm may be so great that the heart becomes incapable even of exerting sufficient pressure to keep the blood circulating unobstructed through the blood vessels. If such a situation continues for some time, the different waste materials found in the urine (accumulated naturally in the collecting system of the kidneys and in the urinary bladder) become high in proportion to the surplus water found there. And when that urine becomes sedimented, the waste materials start crystallizing. These crystals or stones can occur in different sizes and kinds. During urination, the presence of these stones blocks or obstructs the natural flow of urine. In that situation the bodily organs try to eject these stones from the kidneys to assure the flow of urine. This very effort of the organs is very painful for the patient. So wherever urine containing such impurities gets a chance to settle, the impurities crystallize and form kidney stones.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="28..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Rattle of the throat in the morning and evening, hoarse voice, dry cough; or sputum with flecks of blood, or bloody vomiting; feeling slightly feverish from evening on; pain in the chest and back; general debility; and sweating at night &ndash; especially sweating of the head &ndash; are the main symptoms of tuberculosis.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28..3"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Causes<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Tuberculosis germs are present in almost all human bodies in greater or lesser numbers. So long as the strength of the blood and vitality of the human body remain normal, tuberculosis germs cannot do any harm or cause any disease. If, however, the strength and purity of the blood break down for any specific reason, then the tuberculosis germs get a chance to settle in different glands and joints and start multiplying.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Persons with pure blood usually have sound lungs &ndash; that is why it is not possible for tuberculosis germs to attack them. But when the strength of the lungs declines due to weakening of the blood, the germs succeed in establishing a foothold in them. Under such circumstances, to maintain their own health, the lungs try to expel the germs. This attempt takes the form of coughing.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Such coughing is a natural phenomenon to keep the body free of mucus and is not at all harmful. The best way to recognize this harmless type of cough is that there is almost some phlegm or mucus coming out with it. But when the cough happens to be dry and persists day after day, then it should be understood that there must be something seriously wrong in the system or that the tuberculosis germs are trying to dig into the lungs with all their might. This condition is the first stage of tuberculosis. In this stage there is usually a feeling of general debility, accompanied by night sweats &ndash; other symptoms are not so fully expressed.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->In the subsequent stage of the disease, nature starts forming mucus around the diseased parts of the body in order to keep the internal organs strong and active. That is why a little bit of mucus is usually brought up while coughing. After the germ has managed to acquire a firm foothold in the lungs, the mucus also shows some flecks of blood, and the patient suffers from pain in the chest and back. Due to obstruction of the natural movement of the body&#146;s fluids, a rattling sound and hoarseness appear in the throat. In the evening a fever of 99-100 degrees F occurs. Sometimes the patient vomits blood also.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph --><i>Begarodha&#x301;t ks&#x301;aya&#x301;cchaeva sa&#x301;hasa&#x301;dvis&#x301;ama&#x301;shana&#x301;t</i> &ndash; that is, when the fluid elements or the vital energy of the body becomes obstructed, people suffer an attack of tuberculosis. When tuberculosis attacks as a result of such obstructions, patients become emaciated and lose strength of mind within a short passage of time.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->The final essence of the human body is <i>shukra</i>. As butter is obtained by churning milk, similarly the essence of the blood turns into <i>shukra</i>. Due to the excessive wasting of this essence of the body, <i>shukra,</i> the blood becomes lifeless and the vital energy decreases. As a result, tuberculosis germs easily get a chance to acquire a foothold in the body.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->If people labour beyond their capacity, whether just taking a risk, or driven by the mentality of gaining applause or by financial greed, then their vital energy is reduced and tuberculosis may attack.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->If any person is long habituated to eating badly-combined foods, such as meat, fish, eggs and similar <i>ta&#x301;masika</i> foods immediately before or after milk, <i>ks&#x301;iira</i> [a kind of rice pudding] and similar <i>sa&#x301;ttvika</i><!-- fn --><a name="Ref.28.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#28.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> foods, then those foods create a favourable condition in the body for tuberculosis.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Overeating day after day when one is only a little hungry or not hungry at all is also a bad food habit. Such harmful habits encourage tuberculosis germs.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->If one for a long time cannot obtain enough food or takes innutritious food, that is also a bad food habit. In most cases such habits are the main cause of tuberculosis.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->There are many other possible reasons for this disease, such as: <ol> <li>Blood weakened by acidity due to excessive use of intoxicants; <li>Liver, blood and digestive organs weakened by taking too much non-vegetarian food; <li>Weakening of nerves, veins, arteries and glands of the pelvis by too much indulgence in sexual intercourse; <li>Living in unhealthy surroundings; <li>Too many persons living crowded together; <li>Close contact with tuberculosis patients: <li>Drinking the milk of tuberculous animals or eating their meat. </ol><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->One has to remember in this context that wild birds and animals hardly ever suffer from this disease, whereas it often breaks out among domestic animals such as cattle, horses, ducks, hens, etc. Those persons who have not suffered from tuberculosis even when they have been using the milk or meat of domestic animals for a long time can be presumed to possess exceptionally great vital energy.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Among the domestic animals, goats, sheep, dogs, cats and rabbits are seldom found to suffer from tuberculosis. That is why ancient people used to advise tuberculosis patients to live in close proximity to rabbits. In the Hindu Puranas [mythology] it is said that the moon also once suffered from this disease, and since that time has kept a rabbit on his lap to counter the disease. Therefore another name for the moon in the Puranas is &ldquo;Shasha&#x301;un&#x32D;ka&rdquo; (the Sanskrit word for &ldquo;rabbit&rdquo; is <i>shasha</i>).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Extreme mental exhaustion and despondency in life also destroy people&#146;s vital energy, and as a result, tuberculosis may strike. Tuberculosis of the lungs, or pulmonary tuberculosis, can very quickly destroy the vitality. For this reason pulmonary tuberculosis is the most dangerous kind. However, tuberculosis germs can strike any part of the body, and the causes are the same wherever it strikes.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->One who does not suffer from constipation nor wastes his semen seldom becomes a victim of tuberculosis. This is because, in the first place, in such persons there is no possibility for undigested food, stool or unassimilated <i>pitta</i> to cause any contaminated gas or to breed any kind of harmful bacteria. And in the second place, the sufficient supply of lymph provides vitality to the blood and thereby strength to the body.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="28..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->Due to deficiency in blood and in body fluids, tuberculosis patients lose vigour very quickly; so tuberculosis patients should take easily-digestible and nutritious foods. One should never eat very much food at a time. Foods that may cause constipation should be carefully avoided. Depending on the condition of the liver, one should drink sufficient cow&#146;s milk, goat&#146;s milk, peanut milk or coconut milk. Spices, meat, eggs, ghee and <i>a&#x301;tapa</i> rice should not be taken until the disease has been completely cured, because such types of food cause constipation.<!-- /block --></p>

Fill the bathtub with cold water, and sit in it undressed so that the area from the navel down remains submerged. Keep your feet dry and out of the tub. The area from the neck to the navel should be kept covered with a shirt or dry cloth.

Do likewise on the left-hand side and horizontally from right to left and left to right. You should make sure that the towel on the head remains wet.<br> After this, wipe the abdomen, hands and thighs and take a full bath. If this is not possible, then leave the tub wearing a shirt.<br> This should be practised behind closed doors. In the absence of a bathtub or an earthen trough, a wet towel may be wrapped around the areas to be bathed, but in order to compensate, cold water must be poured constantly over the towel, and the towel which is to be used for the massage must be kept wet. After <i>vya&#x301;paka sna&#x301;na,</i> the thighs, pubic area and abdomen should be warmed with a dry towel.<br> Before and after this bath one should not eat, in order to allow the stomach to rest.<br> &ndash;Trans.]]</p>

<a name="29..3"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Causes<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->In most cases, if not all, impotency is a disease of the intemperate. There are various causes of this disease &ndash;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->1. When the seminal receptacle is already full, a passionate thought will bring a seminal discharge in no time. This is called mental impotency.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->2. Excessive accumulation of poisonous acid or <i>pitta</i> in the body can also effect a quick seminal discharge. Under such a condition the <i>pitta</i> of the male eliminates the possibility of conception by killing female ova. This is called <i>pitta</i> impotency.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->3. If the male and female have a bitter relationship, the resulting mental conflict in the male can bring about a quick emission and destroy chances of conception. This is called conflict impotency.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->4. If excessive waste of semen occurs due to the bad habit of masturbation during adolescence or youth, or due to lack of restraint in married life, the seminal fluid becomes thin and the symptoms of seminal weakness appear. This is also a kind of sexual debility, and it is called seminal infertility.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->5. If one is engaged in much mental or spiritual effort and devotes much time to <i>dhya&#x301;na, dha&#x301;ran&#x301;a&#x301;,</i> and <i>pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;ya&#x301;ma,</i> then his <i>shukra</i> takes too much of an upward course, due to which his testes cannot produce sufficient spermatozoa: in the absence of passionate thoughts, spermatozoa cannot be formed. That is why it is usually observed that scientists and other intellectually-inclined men father no children; or if they do, the children are very short-lived. This is known as infertility due to an ascension of <i>shukra</i>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->6. Due to chronic venereal diseases such as gonorrhoea or syphilis, sometimes males and females suffer from impotency or infertility. This is called syphilitic impotency or infertility.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->7. A serious lack of sexual restraint will make the nerves of the pelvis and genitals weak or damaged. The penis loses its power of erection and becomes very weak. This is called genital impotency.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->8. If there is a congenital weakness of the genital organs, testes, ovaries, etc., this disease is called congenital impotency. This type of impotency is not curable without surgery or intense meditation. Of course, with the help of surgery or intense meditation, it is not impossible to convert a male person into a female or vice versa.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Females who lack sexual self-restraint may also suffer from infertility [analogous to seminal infertility in the male]. Such infertile females suffer from severe abdominal pain during intercourse and also from chronic constipation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Over-indulgence in sexual intercourse may also bring frigidity to women. Such frigid women do not have any particular nervous sensation during sexual intercourse.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="29..31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph --><b>Method of preparation</b>: Cut the <i>bhu&#x301;mi kus&#x301;ma&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;a</i> [bulbous root like big-size <i>ol</i>] into pieces and dry the pieces in the shade.

Those who do not undertake much physical labour, but eat substantial quantities of nutritious food, suffer from excessive blood formation in their systems. This surplus blood, after being converted into flesh and fat, gradually obstructs the activity of the blood vessels, as previously described, and produces too high a pressure of blood on the heart.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Meanwhile, the different bodily organs and glands of those who have an excess blood supply and whose hearts are under too much pressure, become over-active, and it generates anger or sexual passion in them. So in people with this type of high blood pressure, sexual desire and anger grow along with the disease. Sometimes this extreme anger or desire causes death due to bursting of the blood vessels.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->3. Those who shun physical labour, yet eat an abnormal quantity of animal or vegetable proteins, risk injury due to the surplus protein in their systems. Human bodies have no place to store surplus protein, because they have no need to store it. So the organs of the body try to expel it from the system.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->This surplus protein decreases the alkaline portion of the blood and increases the acidic portion. Over-acidity of the blood weakens the blood-producing and blood-purifying organs such as the liver, kidneys, etc., and as a result the veins and arteries also get hardened and weak. These hardened, weak blood vessels cannot maintain the blood circulation, due to which the heart comes under heavy pressure. In this condition, to keep the bodily organs functioning normally, the heart has to over-exert. But the weak blood vessels cannot bear this over-activity of the heart: they burst and cause internal hemorrhaging.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->4. For various reasons the blood-producing and blood-purifying organs may become weak. And when they become quite weak, one gets less than the required quantity of blood for the body. In this condition the patient suffers from a lack of sleep, headache, dizziness, serious physical weakness, etc. This is called low blood-pressure.<!-- /block --></p>

If this is not available either, a wet towel can be used, soaking it repeatedly in water. Fill the bathtub with cold water, and sit in it undressed so that the area from the navel down remains submerged. Keep your feet dry and out of the tub. The area from the neck to the navel should be kept covered with a shirt or dry cloth. The crown of the head and the back of the head should be kept covered with a wet towel.<br> Now take another towel and rub the area from the right side of the abdomen to the groin seven or eight times. Do likewise on the left-hand side and horizontally from right to left and left to right. You should make sure that the towel on the head remains wet.<br> After this, wipe the abdomen, hands and thighs and take a full bath. If this is not possible, then leave the tub wearing a shirt.<br> This should be practised behind closed doors. In the absence of a bathtub or an earthen trough, a wet towel may be wrapped around the areas to be bathed, but in order to compensate, cold water must be poured constantly over the towel, and the towel which is to be used for the massage must be kept wet. After <i>vya&#x301;paka sna&#x301;na,</i> the thighs, pubic area and abdomen should be warmed with a dry towel.<br> Before and after this bath one should not eat, in order to allow the stomach to rest.<br> &ndash;Trans.]]</p>

<a name="31..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->By the side of the arteries there is another system of vessels called <i>shukrabaha&#x301; na&#x301;r&#x301;ii</i>. These vessels, by carrying the most essential element of the body, the <i>shukra,</i> to various parts of the body, maintain the vitality of the nervous system, cells and glands. These <i>shukrabaha&#x301; na&#x301;r&#x301;ii</i> supply <i>shukra</i> to the sperm-producing or ova-producing glands, and with the help of the spermatozoa or ova produced in those glands, help to maintain the immune power and the very existence of the body. If, due to constipation, too much <i>pitta</i> in the body, over-acidity, excessive seminal discharge, or malnutrition, or due to a woman&#146;s giving birth to many children, the person&#146;s blood has lost its vigour or become contaminated, then a certain type of microbe starts breeding in it. When these microbes enter the <i>shukrabaha&#x301; na&#x301;r&#x301;ii</i> and get a chance to settle there, they obstruct the flow of <i>shukra</i> and cause the vessels to swell. This swelling of the <i>shukrabaha&#x301; na&#x301;r&#x301;ii</i> takes the form of elephantiasis.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="32..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->2. Boil 5 tolas of cow&#146;s ghee in a <i>ka&#x301;n&#x32D;sa&#x301;</i> pot. In another pot heat 2-1/2 tolas of ginger extract, and mix it into the boiled ghee and cover with a <i>ka&#x301;n&#x32D;sa&#x301;</i> plate. When the mixture has stopped simmering, take about 2 tolas and pour it into 1/8 seer of hot milk and give it to the asthma patient to drink when his/her suffering is acute. Plenty of mucus and phlegm will immediately be brought up, and the patient will feel relieved. If the mixture can be taken continuously for fifteen days, the disease will be completely cured.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->3. Catch a frog and take out its heart. Cut the heart into four parts. For four consecutive mornings, after having a bath, eat one piece together with a banana on a completely empty stomach. It will bring good results.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->4. Catch 6 or 7 cockroaches and boil them in half a seer of water. When the water has boiled down to 1/8 seer (10 tolas), strain it carefully and drink it hot twice a day, 5 tolas each time. This relieves asthma.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->5. Burn a peacock feather to ashes and take 1/16 tola of the ashes by slowly licking with honey. This will relieve the suffering of asthma within a short time. 6.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->6. Aged raw cane sugar and pure mustard oil mixed in equal quantities (preferably one tola each), if taken by licking them each day early in the morning for twenty-one days continuously on an empty stomach, will give excellent results in asthma.<!-- /block --></p>

If this is not possible, then leave the tub wearing a shirt.<br> This should be practised behind closed doors. In the absence of a bathtub or an earthen trough, a wet towel may be wrapped around the areas to be bathed, but in order to compensate, cold water must be poured constantly over the towel, and the towel which is to be used for the massage must be kept wet.

<a name="33..1"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Symptoms<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Leucoderma, though identified as a disease of the leprosy group, is not as fatal as leprosy, nor are secretions of fluid present; and that is why leucoderma is not a contagious disease. Leprosy attacks due to the disturbance of all seven elements of the body, and severely affects the entire body and mind within a very short time; but with leucoderma, usually only three elements &ndash; blood, flesh and fat &ndash; become disturbed.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->At first, reddish-coloured spots appear on different parts of the body, such as the chest, face, heels, toes, fingers and lips. It appears as if the skin of those parts has become pale, and later those red spots become white. It has already been said that leucoderma is not a contagious disease, but those white patches look so ugly that people are frightened and look at leucoderma patients hatefully, as if they were sinners or criminals.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33..4"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Causes<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Contamination of the blood is the root cause of leucoderma. Where the skin has suddenly become weak due to excessive acidity of the blood, there the disease appears. We usually notice that if a person is suffering from chronic constipation, or if one has been treated with astringent medicines which keep the poison of dysentery inside the body, then that person may suffer from an attack of leucoderma as an after-effect of or reaction to the previous disease. That is why I previously felt obliged to express my opinion against using injections to stop dysentery.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="33..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->At both times, after performing the <i>a&#x301;sanas,</i> patients should do <i>shiitalii kumbhaka</i> and should give the affected areas a good massage.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33..10"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Diet<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Constipating foods should be strictly avoided. Foods which increase the amount of <i>pitta</i> should also be rejected. Fish, meat, eggs, ghee and large quantities of spices usually weaken the liver and bring about constipation, which is one of the causes of leucoderma. In this disease fish and other non-vegetarian foods are very harmful, hence they are to be avoided like poison. No matter how great is the desire for non-vegetarian dishes, patients shall have to control that desire. Leafy vegetables such as <i>helein&#x32D;ca&#x301;, gima&#x301;, a&#x301;marula, bra&#x301;hmii,</i> etc., are most beneficial for leucoderma patients.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33..12"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Dos and don&#146;ts<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Leucoderma and dysentery are related diseases. Therefore, the dos and don&#146;ts stipulated for dysentery should generally be observed for leucoderma also. It is desirable for patients to drink at least four-and-a-half seers of water a day &ndash; a small quantity at a time, many times during the day. Both sweet and sour fruit juices are very beneficial. It is also very desirable to fast on <i>eka&#x301;dashii, pu&#x301;rn&#x301;ima&#x301;</i> and <i>ama&#x301;vasya&#x301;</i> days. In summer and winter at the proper time, patients should take a sun-bath for ten to fifteen minutes and thereafter should sponge the whole body with a wet towel. This process should be repeated a few times. After the last sun-bath, instead of using a wet towel, patients should massage their bodies with olive oil, or, if this is not available, with <i>mahuya&#x301;</i> oil. One has to remember that sunshine is essential if one is to maintain the health of the skin and therefore sun-bathing is very beneficial for any disease produced by weakness of the skin.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->It is not at all impossible to recover from leucoderma if the <i>a&#x301;sanas</i> and other prescriptions given above are followed with patience.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Because three elements of the body are disturbed in this disease, care must be taken to control one&#146;s diet and other habits. Sleeping during the day, staying awake at night, sexual intercourse, overeating, etc., have to be avoided at all costs.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="33..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->6. To cure leucoderma within a very short time, grind 1/16 tola of white <i>jayantii</i> in cow&#146;s milk, and drink that mixture on a Sunday.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="34..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Occurrence of nocturnal emission more than four times a month; weakness on awakening, especially weakness of the knees; voice becoming rasping for one&#146;s age, or cracking; swelling of cheeks and neck; frequent colds; etc., are symptoms of this disease.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Generally a portion of the semen produced in the body is surplus. In single men, this surplus semen is expelled with the urine or during three or four nocturnal emissions per month. In married men it is discharged during intercourse. This discharge is harmful neither physically nor mentally. But if the discharge becomes greater than this, or if one does not enjoy any nervous pleasure during the discharge or if the semen becomes watery, or if one does not wake up after a wet dream, then it must be taken as a serious disease.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34..4"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Causes<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Generally nocturnal emission is a disease of adolescence and early youth. It can have various causes &ndash;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->1. If due to the bad habit of masturbation a large amount of semen is wasted or the semen becomes thin, one will contract this disease.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->2. If the genital organ is not kept clean, a particular kind of microbe can start breeding and cause nocturnal emission.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->3. The disease may occur if, due to lack of knowledge about sex or due to any other reason, personal hygiene is not maintained properly; or<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->4. If, at a young age, a boy does not take part in sports, perform <i>a&#x301;sanas</i> or enjoy the outdoors, and instead studies excessively; or<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->5. If the nerves of adolescents or youths are stimulated by reading erotic literature or seeing erotic pictures and films.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->6. The disease can occur when one lacks control over his thoughts or lacks concentration on the Supreme and lets his vrttis (mental propensities) run towards sensual experience.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->7. Eating too much spicy food, non-vegetarian food or rich food, or eating late at night, can make the stomach hot. In such cases, or if one suffers from constipation due to a defect of the liver, the <i>shukra</i> cannot ascend from the lower to the upper part of the body. Instead, it flows out of the body and causes this disease.<!-- /block --></p>

A suitable quantity of fruits, roots and milk can be taken. All kinds of intoxicants should be avoided. <i>La&#x301;u</i> [<i>Lagenaria siceraria Standl.</i>], green pumpkin [<i>Benincasa hispida Cogn.</i>], <i>kalmii sha&#x301;k</i> and <i>sha&#x301;n&#x32D;ka&#x301;lu</i> [<i>Pachyrrhizus erosus</i>] are good in this disease.<!-- /block --></p>

If health permits, patients should bathe at least twice a day. Patients should also drink four to five seers of water a day. Doing ample physical labour and walking or running in the open air in the morning and evening is a must in this disease.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->To keep the disease hidden from others out of shame is very harmful. Therefore, as soon as the symptoms become apparent, the advice of appropriate persons should be sought and acted on.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Patients should observe the rules of fasting on <i>eka&#x301;dashii, pu&#x301;rn&#x301;ima&#x301;</i> and <i>ama&#x301;vasya&#x301;,</i> and should live as far as possible in natural surroundings.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Nature&#146;s rules should be observed in all respects, whether in food, in behaviour or in one&#146;s daily life. At the beginning of adolescence and youth, one has to acquire a correct knowledge about the arrangements that nature has made to meet the demands of human bodies and minds, because through such knowledge one can protect oneself from the onslaught of disease.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->Due to the quick development of physical energy at this age, nature has provided necessary hair at the joints of the body to keep the body heat balanced and, because of the possibility of rubbing, to keep the skin healthy. So when people remove this hair owing to lack of proper knowledge, they harm themselves both physically and mentally.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->Dinner should be finished by 8:30 or 9 P.M., and one should not retire to bed within one-and-a-half hours after dinner. After a meal the breath should flow freely through the right nostril for some time.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->Excessive mixing of the sexes, reading or seeing pornographic books, pictures and films, are to be strictly avoided. Water should be used after urination, and the genital organ should be kept clean, keeping the foreskin pulled back. When bathing, the joints, especially the groin and the armpits, should be properly cleaned. It is very important to take <i>vya&#x301;paka shaoca</i><!-- fn --><a name="Ref.34.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#34.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> before and after every meal, before and after study, and before going to bed. Remember not to take the disease lightly, because nocturnal emission effects a pervasive waste of <i>shukra,</i> the most essential element of the body, and causes all the organs of the body to become weak. It is <i>shukra</i> that nourishes all the brain cells and nerves. Therefore, too much loss of <i>shukra</i> makes the brain weak; the memory becomes short; in adolescence one becomes mentally old; one suffers from palpitation in the chest for no reason; and courage and spiritedness are lost.<!-- /block --></p>

If this is not available either, a wet towel can be used, soaking it repeatedly in water. Fill the bathtub with cold water, and sit in it undressed so that the area from the navel down remains submerged. Keep your feet dry and out of the tub. The area from the neck to the navel should be kept covered with a shirt or dry cloth. The crown of the head and the back of the head should be kept covered with a wet towel.<br> Now take another towel and rub the area from the right side of the abdomen to the groin seven or eight times. Do likewise on the left-hand side and horizontally from right to left and left to right. You should make sure that the towel on the head remains wet.<br> After this, wipe the abdomen, hands and thighs and take a full bath. If this is not possible, then leave the tub wearing a shirt.<br> This should be practised behind closed doors. In the absence of a bathtub or an earthen trough, a wet towel may be wrapped around the areas to be bathed, but in order to compensate, cold water must be poured constantly over the towel, and the towel which is to be used for the massage must be kept wet. After <i>vya&#x301;paka sna&#x301;na,</i> the thighs, pubic area and abdomen should be warmed with a dry towel.<br> Before and after this bath one should not eat, in order to allow the stomach to rest.<br> &ndash;Trans.]]</p>

<a name="35..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Normally menstruation occurs once in a lunar month. Though as a rule, it occurs every twenty-eight days, the interval may be twenty-nine or thirty days for some and twenty-six or twenty-seven days for others, according to the woman&#146;s physical condition. Usually menstruation lasts for three to five days. If the menstruation does not follow the above pattern according to the lunar month or if it lasts for a week or two; or if it sometimes occurs and sometimes does not; or if sometimes there is excessive bleeding and sometimes very little; then it may be termed &ldquo;irregular menstruation.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->In a healthy woman the menstrual discharge is usually about one-fourth seer. If for any reason the quantity is less than normal, it is called &ldquo;hypomenorrhoea.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->If there is no menstrual discharge on the fixed date, or if the menstruation stops for two or three months in spite of the woman not being pregnant, then the condition is termed &ldquo;amenorrhoea.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35..6"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Causes<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->In tropical countries a woman&#146;s fertility lasts from the age of twelve or fourteen up to the age of forty-five or fifty-five, and in cold countries it lasts from fourteen or sixteen up to fifty or sixty. A regular interval of monthly menstruation and a regular amount of discharge throughout these years is a sign of good health. Every month in a fertile woman the uterus prepares its endometrium (uterine lining) to be the first home for a possible embryo. All of the glands that maintain the youth of the body help directly or indirectly in this work of forming the embryo. These glands also cooperate in providing blood to the uterus to develop the embryo. When the sperm comes into contact with the ovum and an embryo gets an opportunity to form, that blood supply is used in building the body of the embryo. But if, for any reason, no embryo is formed, then the uterus, now full of blood, breaks up the endometrium, and the accumulated blood, not being of any other use to the body, is expelled with the remains of the endometrium. This unnecessary blood is called &ldquo;menstrual discharge.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Anaemia is the main cause behind all types of abnormal menstruation &ndash; menorrhagia [excessive flow], hypomenorrhoea, and irregular menstruation. When women suffer from anaemia, the glands that help maintain youth also suffer from debilities and as a result the endometrium cannot develop. And in the case of anaemia, sufficient blood cannot be stored in the uterus to form an embryo. This condition brings about hypomenorrhoea. When, owing to the meagre blood supply or to any defect in the organs of the body (conditions which may be found in both thin and fat women), very little blood is stored in the uterus; and the woman also suffers from upward-moving <i>va&#x301;yu;</i> then her menstrual flow may stop completely, and this is called &ldquo;amenorrhoea.&rdquo; In such a situation, the accumulation of impure blood may create many disorders in the body which can lead to premature death. This type of woman with a weak constitution often also suffers from tuberculosis, asthma and similar chronic diseases. Amenorrhoea can cause hysteria or even temporary insanity. A woman may also become irritable in disposition due to the disease.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->The reasons behind irregular menstruation are liver defects, constipation and excessive sex.<!-- /block --></p>

All types of fruit juice, milk, leafy vegetables and vegetable soups are excellent foods during this period. Non-vegetarian food, too much fried or parched food, and too much ghee, oil or spicy food are to be rejected.

<a name="35..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->During the menstrual period sleeping during the day, staying awake at night and hard physical labour should be avoided. Bending forward to lift heavy loads is forbidden, because such pressure may displace the blood-filled uterus. Warming oneself by the fire is also forbidden, because staying too long in the heat of the fire may excite the body and mind. Women who have no one to assist them in cooking may cook meals outside the kitchen in the open air, using a portable stove. As much as possible they should keep away from the food; otherwise there is a high possibility that the menstrual discharge will come in contact with the food and contaminate it.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.35.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#35.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> To keep the body completely free of excitement, menstruating women must not touch adult males. In order to save their husbands and children from any harmful effect from their menstrual discharge, they should sleep on separate beds. And those beds should be kept dry, warm and comfortable.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->Women should keep away from strenuous acts such as singing, dancing and blowing conch-shells during their menstrual period, and for the sake of their minds and bodies should keep engaged in light, restful chores or amusing conversation. Finally, they should utilize as much of the day as possible in <i>Iishvara pran&#x301;idha&#x301;na</i> [meditation] as taught by an <i>a&#x301;ca&#x301;rya/a&#x301;</i>.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="35..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->During menstruation, using tampons of cotton or linen which block the vagina is harmful. Instead, women should wear shorts over a <i>kaopiina</i> [a tight-fitting kind of underwear] or a cotton pad.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="35..33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->Women who are adverse to physical labour, and who generally are from rich or upper middle-class families, are found suffering from this disease. Due to lack of physical labour, or due to physical debility for any reason, the uterus and the ovaries become weak and cannot stand the pressure of blood during the menstrual period. As soon as the blood starts entering the uterus, both the uterus and the ovaries start reacting adversely and that adverse reaction expresses itself as pain in the abdomen.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35..34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->Women doing adequate physical labour seldom suffer from this disease. If mental dissatisfaction is added to the lack of physical labour, then the disease is aggravated. When women in upper-class society are compelled to lead dissatisfied sex lives on account of various social restrictions, they also suffer from this disease.

<a name="35..67"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=67 type=paragraph -->For adolescent girls suffering from abnormal discharges, attention should be given to the maintenance of their personal hygiene, together with the practice of <i>a&#x301;sanas</i> and <i>mudra&#x301;s</i>. Leucorrhoea occurs if contaminated matter gets a chance to accumulate inside the genital organ. So both males and females should use water after urinating. Adolescent girls suffering from this disease should wash internally either with soap and water or with water which has been boiled with neem [<i>Azadirachta indica A. Juss</i>] leaves. The fingernails should be cut short, otherwise women may injure themselves internally.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="35..74"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=74 type=paragraph -->Symptoms<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35..75"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=75 type=paragraph -->Heavy feeling in the abdomen, difficulty in defecating and urinating, anaemia, white leucorrhoea, pain in the back and waist, pain like the pain of cramps, etc., are the symptoms of this disease.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35..76"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=76 type=paragraph -->Causes<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35..77"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=77 type=paragraph -->The uterus lies in a suspended position supported by a few ligaments behind the navel region. So it is not at all unusual for the uterus to get displaced or to change sides. Since the uterus is situated in between the urinary bladder and the rectum, any displacement of it may hinder defecation or urination. The uterus has an elastic quality and can shrink and expand. This is why a positional change of the uterus may cause great disorder in the lower trunk.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35..78"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=78 type=paragraph -->Though constipation is not the only cause of this disease, it is the main one. Because, due to accumulation of stool, the colon gets swollen, putting pressure on the uterus, and causing it to change its position. Again, though there are many reasons for constipation, excessive sexual activity is the main one.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35..79"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=79 type=paragraph -->During menstruation, when the uterus remains full of blood, bending forward to do any heavy chore, or lifting heavy pots from the stove, may also lead to the displacement of the uterus.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35..80"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=80 type=paragraph -->Due to excessive sexual intercourse, the nervous system of the lower portion of the body may suffer from all-round debility. Consequently, those few ligaments that keep the uterus suspended also become weak, and thereby become a factor in the displacement of the uterus.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35..81"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=81 type=paragraph -->Too much use of medicines and injections also weakens the blood and nerve-cells, due to which dislodgement of the uterus may occur. Anaemia and nervous debilities caused in this way are two of the many causes of displacement of the uterus.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35..82"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=82 type=paragraph -->Repeated induced child-births, short-cutting the body&#146;s normal child-bearing forces, may also weaken the nerves of the lower body. This enhances the chance of displacement of the uterus.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="35..90"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=90 type=paragraph -->With this disease patients should be allowed to rest as much as possible. Sexual intercourse should be completely stopped. If the uterus is found to be totally displaced; or if there is acute burning; or if the displacement arises from a tumor in the uterus or in the abdomen; then adopting the above steps will bring good results.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35..91"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=91 type=paragraph -->But some women in this situation undergo surgery to remove the uterus or ovaries. Obviously, such surgery cannot bring about a cure. Rather, this is like trying to cure a headache by cutting off the head. The loss of these important glands makes a woman sexually neuter and brings about great changes in body and mind. Different mental disorders appear, and often the woman goes mad. So as soon as a woman realizes that she has a displaced uterus, she should be especially careful to avoid constipation and to see that her urination remains normal.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="35..93"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=93 type=paragraph -->Symptoms<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35..94"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=94 type=paragraph -->If a woman between the ages of sixteen or seventeen and thirty or thirty-five is unable to conceive in spite of having sexual intercourse, this may be considered a case of sterility or infertility. However, the sterility may or may not be that of the woman. Often it is due to sterility of the male partner that society considers a woman sterile.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35..95"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=95 type=paragraph -->Causes<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35..96"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=96 type=paragraph -->Behind sterility or infertility there can be a number of causes.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35..97"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=97 type=paragraph -->1. The ova, produced in the ovaries, pass through the Fallopian tubes to reach the uterus. When the Fallopian tubes are weak, diseased, or blocked by contaminated matter, the ova either fail to reach the uterus or die on the way. Consequently, conception cannot take place even if living spermatozoa are present in the uterus.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35..98"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=98 type=paragraph -->2. The ovaries, the ova-producing organs, are situated a little above the groin on either side. Due to lack of physical labour, anaemia, physical debility or any other physical defect, or any congenital defect, the ovaries may not be able to produce ova, or only overly-weak ones. When this takes place, women will be sterile or give birth to still-born babies.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35..99"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=99 type=paragraph -->3. In the case of women who are very bad-tempered, that is, dominated by the <i>va&#x301;yu</i> or <i>pitta</i> factor a little of the <i>pitta</i> can enter the uterus and be stored there. This poisonous <i>pitta</i> kills the sperm and destroys the chance of conception.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35..100"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=100 type=paragraph -->4. Excess body fat can cause the female genitals to become somewhat misshapen. As a result, the sperm cannot reach their destination and conception cannot take place. To such women intercourse becomes frustrating, and their sexual dissatisfaction makes them both over-desirous and quarrelsome, and destroys the peace of their domestic life.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35..101"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=101 type=paragraph -->5. Excessive intercourse makes the nervous system of the lower portion of the body weak and insensitive, and conception cannot take place. For just this reason, prostitutes are generally infertile.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35..102"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=102 type=paragraph -->6. Excessive acidity of the body, many a time, does not allow the foetus to draw the fluids or blood necessary for its development, so the foetus dies a premature death; that is, the woman tends to have still-births. Women who are excessively fond of eating non-vegetarian food but do not undertake adequate physical labour suffer from over-acidity of the blood.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35..103"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=103 type=paragraph -->7. Those males who develop the unnatural habit of wasting their semen excessively before they attain the age of twenty-five or twenty-six tend to lose their capacity to produce healthy sperm. The sperm of such persons cannot produce an embryo.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35..104"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=104 type=paragraph -->8. In the case of males who, even after attaining adulthood, live intemperately, the testes cannot produce healthy sperm; in this case also conception cannot take place.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35..105"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=105 type=paragraph -->9. If a male suffers from excessive <i>pitta</i> secretion, that <i>pitta</i> destroys the ova in the uterus and does not allow any embryo to be formed.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35..106"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=106 type=paragraph -->10. If the spermatic duct becomes diseased, weak, hardened or full of impurities, then a person becomes infertile, and conception cannot take place.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35..107"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=107 type=paragraph -->Treatment<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35..108"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=108 type=paragraph -->The causes behind sterility and infertility are many. Therefore one particular remedy cannot be applied in all cases. The original defect in the male or female which has caused the sterility should be treated properly. Removing the defect or defects will bring good results with the sterility.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35..109"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=109 type=paragraph -->Inability to bear a second child, after bearing one, should be treated in just the same manner.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35..110"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=110 type=paragraph -->Many people think that infertility can occur due to leucorrhoea or displacement of the uterus. But this impression is not entirely correct. Because even during such conditions the link between the ovaries and the uterus through the Fallopian tubes remains unaffected. But it is true that, if these diseases are present, the chance of still-births is greater.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35..111"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=111 type=paragraph -->If the testes of the male or the ovaries of the female are underdeveloped for congenital reasons, that type of sterility if very difficult to cure.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35..112"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=112 type=paragraph -->Very often the opening of the vagina becomes flaccid or stretched, and the vagina almost protrudes.

<a name="35..123"></a><p class="Para_Major_Heading"><!-- block a=123 type=paragraph -->CONCLUSION<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35..124"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=124 type=paragraph -->At present a large number of women in society suffer from one female disease or other. The main reasons are:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35..125"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=125 type=paragraph -->1. Lack of nutritious diet and consequent anaemia;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35..126"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=126 type=paragraph -->2. Unnatural way of life;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35..127"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=127 type=paragraph -->3. Lack of proper observation of the dos and don&#146;ts during menstruation;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35..128"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=128 type=paragraph -->4. Lack of sexual restraint by males and females;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35..129"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=129 type=paragraph -->5. Ignorance regarding sexual matters.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35..130"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=130 type=paragraph -->Though female diseases may not be obviously fatal, they slowly sap the vitality of the individual, and children, who are the hope of society, are born with mental and physical defects which remain throughout their lives. What a terrible situation this is for society can easily be imagined. On account of female diseases women often die prematurely. In most cases, if not all, lack of self-control by the male is one of the causes of female disease. It is certainly not desirable for women to go to their graves prematurely due to the intemperance of men. Sexual over-indulgence is also harmful to the men, because it causes excessive wastage of <i>shukra,</i> which [in the lymph stage] nourishes the brain. Remember that self-control is the greatest thing in life.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="36..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Fat is an indispensable element of the human body. Without fat, the natural activity of the bones and muscles could not be sustained for a single moment. But when this very fat abnormally accumulates beyond the ordinary requirement of the body, it causes all the organs of the body to become incapacitated. This state is called obesity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36..3"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Causes<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Lack of physical labour, and at the same time eating lots of curd (yoghurt), milk, butter and other high-calorie foods; eating large quantities of sweets and large quantities of mucus-producing foods (fish, tamarind, etc.) are the main causes of obesity. And especially if, along with the above reasons, a particular person undertakes too much mental exertion, then in most cases he/she becomes obese.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Persons who do physical labour need nutritious and nonvegetarian types of food, milk and ghee. Those who do mental work and don&#146;t undertake much physical work require very little non-vegetarian, sweet and fatty foods. But sensual persons, for the sake of taste-satisfaction, take large quantities of food which they do not need or need very little of.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->In the world today a handful of people who do no physical work, but live by their wits, have appropriated to themselves most of the wealth of humanity, so they are able to buy comparatively expensive foods, and use them to satisfy their taste buds. As a result, they, on the one hand, swell with unnecessary fat, while, on the other hand, those people doing hard manual labour are forced to live in poverty and deprived of the ghee, butter and sweets they need to maintain their bodies; they have nothing to compensate properly the energy they expend, and they become weak, emaciated and broken in health. On account of malnutrition and excessive hard labour, they fall victim to tuberculosis. Remember that in tropical countries non-vegetarian food is generally like poison, but for those doing a great amount of physical labour, a little such food does no harm to their bodies, nor does it exert its harmful influence on their minds.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->So my point is that obesity is primarily a disease of well-off, non-labouring society. High-salaried office workers, rich businessmen and parasitic politicians are those who suffer most from obesity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->It should be borne in mind that the fat stored in the human body is nothing but its work energy in latent form. When fasting or doing physical labour, it becomes liquefied, then transformed into vital energy or work energy. So when people perform little manual labour, their fat becomes their enemy and pushes them to their death.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->When this fat accumulates in the abdominal region, it causes sterility in women and impotency in men. That is why we find that in most cases obese people have no children. Too much accumulation of fat on the chest and abdomen disturbs the <i>va&#x301;yu;</i> and then, as long as the liver is not affected, the person suffers from &ldquo;demon hunger&rdquo;; so much so that in homes where the person is entertained, he or she becomes famous for his or her voracity. Another distinguishing mark of such people is that they are most greedy for those foods which are most fattening; that is, when invited outside, they will never even by mistake eat much in the way of vegetable preparations &ndash; instead they will eat a lot of <i>luci,</i> fish, meat and sweets.<!-- /block --></p>

Then they will sorrowfully say to people that they cannot consume food as they used to. Their muscles become flaccid and they begin to suffer from acidity, constipation or intestinal troubles. Fat accumulated on the chest affects the heart and lungs and makes it difficult for these organs to function. Victims&#146; respiration becomes troublesome, they tire out very easily, gasp for breath, and sit down sweating profusely. Fat accumulated in the blood vessels causes patients to suffer from high blood pressure, which may finally lead to an internal haemorrhage by bursting the blood vessels of the brain or of any part of the body, causing death or paralysis.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="36..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->Some obese people try simply to eat less, surmising that in doing so they will be able to lose weight. This is not a correct approach, because such dieting can weaken the patient to such an extent that he or she cannot even get up or walk. What the patient needs is a simple, carefully selected diet. For instance:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->1. One should drink about four or five seers of water daily, but not much at a time. As far as possible the patient should always mix lemon juice with the water.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->2. Completely stop taking non-vegetarian food, ghee and oil. Three-fourths to a seer of diluted milk should be taken, a little at a time, a number of times during the day.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->3. Depending upon the appetite, all kinds of fruit in plentiful quantity, preferably sour juicy types, can be taken. These fruits are very beneficial for the obese.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->4. Reduce or eliminate rice, <i>rut&#x301;i</i> and pulses, and instead eat green vegetables and soups made from them in greater quantity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36..30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->5. One must reduce the use of raw and refined sugar, but may use a little honey &ndash; nor more than three spoonfuls a day.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="36..32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->Rules of fasting and sun-bathing should be observed by patients. Generally speaking, obesity is the disease of the sedentary and the greedy. So as far as possible, simple food should be eaten.

And patients should give up their habit of sitting and giving orders, and instead should do the work by their own physical efforts.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="37..1"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Symptoms<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Strong beating sound in the chest, chest pain, breathing troubles, trembling of arms and legs, etc., are the symptoms of this disease.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37..3"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Causes<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->There can be many reasons behind heart disease.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->1. Persons who keep their stomachs full and heavy need a greater blood supply for their stomachs, and their hearts have to overwork in order to keep up that extra supply. Consequently their hearts become weak.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->2. Persons above thirty-five or forty years of age who consume an excessive quantity of non-vegetarian food out of greed may also suffer from heart disease; because non-vegetarian food increases the acidity of the blood, and this compels the heart to overwork in order to purify the blood; and the heart becomes weak. An increase in the acidity of blood also gradually weakens other organs of the body, and those weaknesses directly or indirectly weaken the heart.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->3. Taking excessive fatty and oily food and not undertaking a proportional amount of physical labour loads the human nervous system down with fat, and as a result it becomes impossible for the nerves to properly assist the heart. As a result the heart becomes weak. Fat accumulated in the nerves and blood vessels terribly hampers the blood circulation, and in order to maintain the circulation, the heart is forced to overwork. As a consequence the heart soon becomes weak.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->4. Due to debility of the liver, surplus fat of the body may get a chance to accumulate in the nerves and blood vessels, and the heart naturally becomes weak. Usually patients of this condition have chronic dysentery also.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->5. Another reason for heart disease is the practice of eating too much food at one sitting with little or no appetite; because taking a large quantity of food enlarges the stomach, and that enlarged stomach starts putting pressure on the heart above it. Persons who do not have breakfast and an afternoon snack usually eat heavy meals at lunch and dinner. If such a habit continues day after day, their stomachs get enlarged and they suffer from heart disease.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->6. Constipation is another reason for heart disease. If the bowels are not cleared, the accumulated stool decays inside the body and breeds a certain type of germ. If these germs get a chance to strike the heart, the patient suffers from heart disease.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->7. Ill-tempered persons also run the risk of heart disease, because in anger the flow of blood to the head and face becomes suddenly accelerated (which makes these people turn red). To supply this extra blood, the heart has suddenly to work very hard. That is why persons who are habitually ill-tempered suffer from weakness of the heart. For the same reason, extreme shyness may make the heart weak.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->8. In extreme fright also, the blood all of a sudden leaves the other parts of the body and rushes towards the heart in great quantity. It is difficult for the heart to stand this pressure, so in extreme fright the heart pounds or palpitates, and often even stops beating and causes death. (People have often been known to die of heart failure in fear of imaginary ghosts; and just before death or immediately thereafter, such terror-stricken people suffer from bleeding from the mouth and nose, and other people see it and think that the victims have really been killed by ghosts.) So fearful persons are often found to be suffering from heart disease.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->9. For the same reason, indulgence in sex causes the heart to strain and the breathing to become heavy. So habitually passionate people also suffer from heart disease. Too much seminal loss in young people also brings about heart disease.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->10. Use of wine, tobacco, <i>vir&#x301;i,</i> cigarettes and other intoxicants in excessive quantity brings about constipation, which is one cause of heart disease. Moreover, intoxicants increase the acidity of the blood, weaken the glandular system, and ultimately prevent the active cooperation of the heart and the glands, causing them to fall sick.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->11. When a person suffers from some devitalizing or chronic disease for a long time, his or her blood will become weak. And to revitalize that blood, the person&#146;s heart has to overwork, and gradually the heart becomes weak. That is why with beriberi, pneumonia, tuberculosis, diabetes, gonorrhoea, syphilis and female disease, the longer a patient suffers, the more the heart becomes weak, and when it becomes extremely weak it stops and the patient dies.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37..16"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Treatment<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Morning &ndash; <i>Utks&#x301;epa Mudra&#x301;</i> (don&#146;t drink too much water), <i>Yogamudra&#x301;, Diirgha Pran&#x301;a&#x301;ma, Bhu&#x301;jaun&#x32D;ga&#x301;sana, Va&#x301;yavii Mudra&#x301;</i> or <i>Va&#x301;yavii Pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;ya&#x301;ma,</i> and <i>Padahasta&#x301;sana</i>.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="37..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->Remember that patients should practise no <i>a&#x301;sanas</i> and <i>mudra&#x301;s</i> other than <i>Utks&#x301;epa Mudra&#x301;</i> when the disease is critical. Only after some improvement in the disease should these a&#x301;sanas and mudra&#x301;s be practised. When patients are more or less cured, they should practice <i>Karma&#x301;sana</i> instead of <i>Padahasta&#x301;sana</i>. The practice of <i>vya&#x301;paka sna&#x301;na</i><!-- fn --><a name="Ref.37.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#37.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> is also especially helpful in this disease.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="37..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->Only fruits and milk should be taken with this disease. Breakfast and afternoon snacks should also be composed of fruits and milk only. At noon a very small quantity of easily-digestible and non-constipating food should be taken; it is better to refrain from eating rice or <i>rut&#x301;i</i> but a little boiled rice can be taken. At the evening meal nothing except fruits and milk should be taken. (Patients should not eat bananas after sunset.) Those who cannot digest milk or who for some reason are unable to procure it, may drink curd-water instead. One should not add salt to food while eating. Care should be taken to let the breath flow through the right nostril for some time after a meal.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37..22"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Dos and don&#146;ts<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Patients&#146; main concern should be to keep their digestive tracts clear, to increase the alkalinity of their blood, and to protect the heart from overworking. That is why complete rest is essential for heart patients. Patients should lie in <i>Shava&#x301;sana</i> all the time when they are critically ill. They should not endeavour to get up from bed even for defecation and urination.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->Patients should never eat a lot at one sitting &ndash; rather they should eat a small quantity at a time, several times. When patients are critically ill they should eat nothing but milk, fruit juice (especially orange/tangerine and tomato), milk or water with honey, and the juice of spinach, <i>kalmii, beto, punarnava&#x301;, shushuni</i> or <i>shulpha&#x301;</i>. When thirsty, drink water with a little lemon juice.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->Sleeping during the day, keeping late nights, and greedily eating a full stomach of food are all very dangerous for heart patients. Dinner invitations usually involve rich food, so patients should not accept dinner invitations. They should go to bed between 8 and 8:30 in the evening.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->One should again remember that eating a small quantity of spinach, <i>beto, kalmii, shulpha&#x301;, shushuni</i> or <i>punarnava&#x301;</i> &ndash; leafy vegetables &ndash; is good for heart patients. <i>Bar&#x301;a ela&#x301;c</i> is also particularly helpful in curing this disease. Utmost attention must be paid to clearing the bowels.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->Heart patients should sleep at least nine hours a night. The mind should always be held back from anger and lust. Physical and mental exertion, garrulousness and sex should all be strictly avoided.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="37..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->1. Every day in the morning and before retiring to bed at night, patients should take a spoonful of <i>bar&#x301;a ela&#x301;c,</i> powdered along with the husk, with honey. This will give good results.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37..30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->2. The juice of <i>shulpha&#x301;</i> greens mixed with honey is very useful in heart disease.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37..31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->3. A spoonful of cinnamon powder with a little honey, taken twice a day, will bring excellent results.<!-- /block --></p>

If this is not available either, a wet towel can be used, soaking it repeatedly in water. Fill the bathtub with cold water, and sit in it undressed so that the area from the navel down remains submerged. Keep your feet dry and out of the tub. The area from the neck to the navel should be kept covered with a shirt or dry cloth. The crown of the head and the back of the head should be kept covered with a wet towel.<br> Now take another towel and rub the area from the right side of the abdomen to the groin seven or eight times. Do likewise on the left-hand side and horizontally from right to left and left to right. You should make sure that the towel on the head remains wet.<br> After this, wipe the abdomen, hands and thighs and take a full bath. If this is not possible, then leave the tub wearing a shirt.<br> This should be practised behind closed doors. In the absence of a bathtub or an earthen trough, a wet towel may be wrapped around the areas to be bathed, but in order to compensate, cold water must be poured constantly over the towel, and the towel which is to be used for the massage must be kept wet. After <i>vya&#x301;paka sna&#x301;na,</i> the thighs, pubic area and abdomen should be warmed with a dry towel.<br> Before and after this bath one should not eat, in order to allow the stomach to rest.<br> &ndash;Trans.]]</p>

If this is not available either, a wet towel can be used, soaking it repeatedly in water. Fill the bathtub with cold water, and sit in it undressed so that the area from the navel down remains submerged. Keep your feet dry and out of the tub. The area from the neck to the navel should be kept covered with a shirt or dry cloth. The crown of the head and the back of the head should be kept covered with a wet towel.<br> Now take another towel and rub the area from the right side of the abdomen to the groin seven or eight times. Do likewise on the left-hand side and horizontally from right to left and left to right. You should make sure that the towel on the head remains wet.<br> After this, wipe the abdomen, hands and thighs and take a full bath. If this is not possible, then leave the tub wearing a shirt.<br> This should be practised behind closed doors. In the absence of a bathtub or an earthen trough, a wet towel may be wrapped around the areas to be bathed, but in order to compensate, cold water must be poured constantly over the towel, and the towel which is to be used for the massage must be kept wet. After <i>vya&#x301;paka sna&#x301;na,</i> the thighs, pubic area and abdomen should be warmed with a dry towel.<br> Before and after this bath one should not eat, in order to allow the stomach to rest.<br> &ndash;Trans.]]</p>

To maintain the internal functions of the body without hindrance and to maintain the internal liquid balance, everyone should drink a sufficient quantity of water every day. A healthy person can consume three or four seers of water a day, a sick person four or five seers, and a person suffering from skin disease, five or six seers. These amounts of water help cure a disease to a great extent.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="46..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Drinking water is good, but water with a little lemon and a little salt is still better.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="46..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->People should not taint their sex lives by over-indulgence. Everyone should remember that <i>shukra</i> is the ultimate element of the body, and if it is absent or somehow impaired, all the elements of the body may become impaired and invite attacks of various diseases.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="46..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Intercourse more than four times a month leads to wastage of <i>shukra,</i> which culminates in debility of the nerve-cells, nerve-fibres, glands, etc. People may become aware of the physical debility caused by this immoderate loss of <i>shukra</i> belatedly, but they will begin to feel the mental and spiritual loss right away. That is why it is not at all desirable for adolescents and young people to remain ignorant of sexual matters.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="46..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->And when it comes down to a choice between restraint and lack of restraint, it is better not even to stipulate four times a month, but simply to say: the more restraint the better.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="46..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Soil possesses great curative properties.

<a name="46..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->If the mud pack starts cracking within about three hours after drying, or if the pack becomes stale, then the pack should be thrown away. The wound should then be cleansed carefully with some antiseptic, and after giving it a sun-bath, a fresh pack should be applied.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="46..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Healthy persons or persons suffering from skin disease should smear their bodies with yellow soil, massage themselves, then immerse themselves in a river or in a pond. This will certainly give good results. It is desirable for everyone to use this mud-massage now and then when they bathe. Those who are suffering from leprosy or other diseases characterized by contaminated sores should definitely have such a mud-massage followed by a bath every day.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="46..13"></a><p class="Para_Major_Heading"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->D. SUN-BATHING<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="46..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->The meaning of <i>a&#x301;tapa sna&#x301;na</i> is &ldquo;sun-bathing,&rdquo; but sunshine is not the same for all countries at all times. Therefore, it is not possible to fix the best time for sun-bathing. But at the present time, in the plains of Bihar, a sun-bath can be taken during the summer until 10 a.m. and during the winter between noon and 2 p.m.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="46..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->During the sun-bath, the diseased parts of the body are exposed to the sun&#146;s rays while the remaining parts are kept in the shade. When the affected area becomes hot after leaving it in the sun for fifteen to twenty minutes, it should be brought into the shade and the procedures described below followed.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="46..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->1. If there is rheumatism or gout in that part of the body, that part should, under advice, be massaged with oil for four or five minutes.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="46..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->2. If it is a skin disease, then that area should be massaged with neem [<i>Azadirachta indica A. Juss.</i>] oil for four or five minutes.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="46..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->3. In the case of other diseases, the affected area should be massaged with a cool, wet towel that has been wrung out.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="46..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->After the temperature of the area has come down to normal, it can once again be exposed to the sun&#146;s rays. After leaving it in the sun for fifteen or twenty minutes, again cool the area by massaging with oil or a towel in the aforesaid manner. Exposure to sun and massage can be done in the same manner again and again. But during the last massage, instead of using oil, it is desirable to wipe with a wet towel in all cases except that of skin disease.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="46..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->If a healthy or sick person so desires, he or she may take a sun-bath over the entire body. In this case, after the completion of the sun-bath, the whole body must be thoroughly wiped off with a wet towel. When taking a sun-bath over the entire body, one should wear little or no clothes and keep the back to the sun. If the diseased area is in the front portion of the body, that is to say, the face, chest, stomach, etc., then it can be kept uncovered but the remaining portions must be kept covered.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="46..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->One should always remember, &ldquo;Expose the stomach to fire and the back to sun;&rdquo; that is, if you need to warm yourself at a fire, keep the stomach towards the fire, never the back.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="46..22"></a><p class="Para_Major_Heading"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->E. TAKING THE AIR<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="46..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Pure, fresh air has the power to cure diseases. It is advisable to breathe in as fully as possible, because when we do so, the air gets an opportunity to penetrate the lungs completely. It is better to take a walk in the fresh air than to ride a vehicle. If the body does not work up a sufficient sweat, then you should know that you have not taken the air properly.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="46..24"></a><p class="Para_Major_Heading"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->F. FASTING<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="46..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->During fasting the body&#146;s organs get a good rest, and the healing process is more rapid. It is possible for one to get relief even from chronic skin diseases if one goes on a long fast and drinks plenty of water with lemon juice.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="46..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->Only persons in very good health and with good energy should fast without water. Persons suffering from gall or kidney-stones should never undertake a waterless fast. Sick persons and people in mediocre health should observe fasting taking plenty of lemon juice and water. Persons who are very weak may take a small quantity of fruit and milk. Persons who, for whatever reason, do not fast on <i>eka&#x301;dashii, pu&#x301;rn&#x301;ima&#x301;</i> and <i>ama&#x301;vasya&#x301;</i> should at least abstain from taking rice, fried vegetables, pulses and non-vegetarian food on those days. They should also take just a little milk, fruit and dry things on the evenings of <i>pu&#x301;rn&#x301;ima&#x301;</i> and <i>ama&#x301;vasya&#x301;</i>.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="46..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->Mental purity helps particularly in keeping a person healthy. Impure thoughts increase the acidity of the blood and invite disorders of the stomach, heart and brain. That is why every human being should make as strong a habit as possible of selfless service and <i>Iishvara pran&#x301;idha&#x301;na</i> [meditation]. The best way to attain mental purity is to follow the principles of <i>Yama</i> and <i>Niyama</i>.
