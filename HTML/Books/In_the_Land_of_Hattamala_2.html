<a name="1..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Look here, Aparna,&rdquo; Anumay said to his little sister, &ldquo;you&#146;re becoming more stupid every day. I&#146;ve told you hundreds of times to keep away from the juniper forest south of here. That&#146;s where the demons live. If anything happened to you, I&#146;d be in big trouble.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;You seem to enjoy scolding me about the silliest of things,&rdquo; complained Aparna. &ldquo;You hardly stop criticizing me day and night. I don&#146;t like being bossed around, you know. I&#146;m grown up now &ndash; I&#146;m almost eight. From now on you should be more respectful.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Their mother came in unexpectedly. &ldquo;My little darling,&rdquo; she asked Aparna, &ldquo;did you address your elder brother as tui<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.1.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#1.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> again today? Haven&#146;t you noticed that your neighbour, Supurna, addresses her elder brother as a&#x301;pni? Some learn by observing others and some learn the hard way from their own mistakes. Observation doesn&#146;t seem to teach you anything at all.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Mummy, why do you compare me with Supurna?&rdquo; asked Aparna. &ldquo;Supurna&#146;s brother, Giitimay, is studying for his MA whereas Supurna hasn&#146;t finished primary school yet. If she doesn&#146;t address her elder brother as a&#x301;pni, how else will she address him?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Then it&#146;s clear you&#146;ll have to learn the hard way, by direct experience,&rdquo; said her mother, leaving the room.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;I really don&#146;t like it when mummy tells you off every day for addressing me as tui,&rdquo; said Anumay. &ldquo;If you want to use tui don&#146;t do it in front of mum or dad. You can call me anything you like when they&#146;re not around.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; concluded Aparna, &ldquo;I swear that from today I&#146;ll only address you as a&#x301;pni.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;You don&#146;t have to go as far as that,&rdquo; said Anumay. &ldquo;If you address me as tumi it&#146;ll be enough&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->The sun was sinking below the horizon; the day was coming to an end. The western skies were radiant, the eastern skies were darkening. Aparna reached the edge of the forest and leaned against her bike in silent contemplation. &ldquo;What should I do now?&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;If I go back after coming this far I&#146;ll lose face. But if I go into the forest I&#146;ll have two problems: I won&#146;t be able to ride my bike anymore, and I won&#146;t be able to see anything &ndash; I don&#146;t even have a torch. I should have thought about these things before setting out.&rdquo; But that was exactly what she hadn&#146;t done.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Suddenly she thought she heard a sound inside the forest. She leaned her bike against a rain tree and slipped into the forest gloom. She could hear the sound of falling leaves, the wind blowing through the branches and twigs, the movement of wild forest animals and the squeaking of her shoes. All this made a wonderful symphony of sound. Anyone sitting at home could never imagine such a thing.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->She walked on and on. There was still enough light and the way was easy. She remembered a song her teacher had taught her a few days before:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..12"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->The intoxicated air<br>Blows joyfully this sweet evening;<br>The softly murmuring forest<br>Is enchanted by that sweet obsession;<br>The leaves, waiting to fall,<br>Quiver in delight.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Then she caught sight of a herd of colourful deer leaping through the forest. There were so many types of deer: black bucks, swamp deer, barking deer, doe, reindeer, sledge deer, snow deer and many more. Some had short stumpy antlers while others had huge, multibranched antlers.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Aparna remembered something her teacher had told her a few days ago: &ldquo;Not all the animals we call deer are actually deer. According to some zoologists, many of them belong to the antelope group. The black buck, blue bull and alpaca can all be classified as antelopes. The antelopes, like many deer, are gradually becoming extinct from the face of the earth.&rdquo; Seeing such beautiful deer reminded Aparna of these words, and she felt great pain.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->She also recalled what her grandmother had told her about the Jhalda<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.1.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#1.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> area, where her great-grandfather used to live. Its forests, which covered the Ayodhya hill southwest of Jhaida, and the banks of the River Suvarnarekha, a little further to the west, were the natural habitat of many different types of deer. That vast forest also covered the areas where Bagmundi, Puncha, Arsa, Jaipur, Silli and Sonahatu are now situated. Populated with sal, cheronjee, mahua, dhak, mangosteen, lac and date trees, it was a spectacular sight. Soaring high above the tree tops was a range of unconquered mountain peaks: Kopila, Belamuk, Dimdiha, Satkuthi and Khir&#x301;ki. There were many other known and unknown mountains of various heights in that range, although most of them were not so high. The water which flowed out of the forest was carried by the rivers Uttara, Daksina, Goal, Alkusi, Kupai, Khirki, Kansai, Kumari, Suvarnarekha and many other rivers of various sizes. Members of the gold-mining community used to pan their sands for gold.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Those forest lands and fertile river valleys were the peaceful habitat of many animals of different shapes and sizes. There were numerous swamp deer, black bucks, lions with huge jaws and long manes, sharp-toothed tigers, extremely long pythons, and many large elephants whose gigantic tusks frightened everyone. That species of elephant is rarely seen today. In former times the inhabitants of the forest used to leave food beside the paths which the elephants used. They didn&#146;t cut down the forests, as people do today, and force the elephants to search desperately for food and shelter. Those simple-minded folk had enough sense to realize that every living being has the right to exist. Even though the elephants frightened them, they still fed them. The villagers of that particular region (Rarh) would leave food for the elephants, saying,<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..17"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;I bow before thee, god Ganesh<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.1.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#1.fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><br>Save my life and my wealth<br>I&#146;ll give you banana, give you maize<br>And feed you milk and rice<br>I&#146;ll give you betel leaves and nuts<br>And the sacred thread<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.1.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#1.fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  too<br>Save my life and my wealth.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Today those forests have disappeared and the herds of elephants and deer are no longer seen; they have become extinct from that plateau. Either they were killed by flesh-hungry hunters or migrated elsewhere due to the unbearable torture inflicted upon them by human beings.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->These thoughts made Aparna feel depressed. But then she saw another herd of deer leaping through the forest and became a lot happier. A huge deer with beautiful antlers suddenly came near her. She took one leap and landed right on its back. This was easy for her as she always came first in the high-jump event in sports competitions.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->But what a problem! What a problem! There weren&#146;t any reins. How could she possibly keep the deer under control. What a problem! However, she had the presence of mind to tightly grip the deer&#146;s antlers. The poor deer thought a tiger had landed on its back and ran in fear of its life. Aparna held on with all her strength and cried out at the top of her voice, &ldquo;Oh what fun, what fun! Great fun, great fun!&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->But fun never lasts long. Suddenly, would you believe, a huge Royal Bengal tiger aimed itself at the deer and leapt out from behind a bush. The deer, just as proficient in the art of jumping, made an even greater leap. Aparna was jolted and lost her grip on the antlers. She was thrown high into the air, screaming, and landed on a branch of an arjuna tree. Fortunately, many branchlets and twigs were growing out of the branch so Aparna got stuck there and didn&#146;t fall down.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->By that time the deer was out of sight. Utterly disappointed, the tiger went into a fit of depression. But that was not the time to get depressed. Pulling himself together, he circled the tree in a fuming rage. There was a faint hope in the corner of his mind that Aparna would fall to the ground like a ripe mango. Then he would chew her up.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->After circling the tree for a long time and realizing there was no likelihood of Aparna dropping, he felt like sitting down. But the ground was so dirty. If he sat there his trousers would become filthy. So he cleaned the place with a broom, spread cow-dung, sprinkled a little holy water<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.1.fn5"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#1.fn5">5</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> and finally settled himself on his tail which he had coiled up like a straw mat. Drooling greedily, he raised his large eyes, stared at Aparna and growled<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..24"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Halum hulum, halum hulum<br>If you fall down I&#146;ll chew you up,<br>Chew you up.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->Aparna was not bothered at all. Opening her eyes as wide as possible she stared back at the tiger and roared,<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..26"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Halum hulum, halum hulum<br>If you climb up the tree<br>I&#146;ll chew you up,<br>Chew you up.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->The tiger was shocked by these words. His whole body shook. His chest heaved. His bones rattled. His temples throbbed. His veins and arteries palpitated. His brain spun at high speed. He was so frightened that his entire body, from his mane to the tip of his tail, became drenched with sweat.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->Taking advantage of the tiger&#146;s pitiful condition, Aparna taunted,<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..29"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;I&#146;m a lion&#146;s maternal aunt,<br>And a dragon&#146;s paternal aunt.<br>What I like to eat the most<br>Is a tiger cooked whole as a roast.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->Hearing these words, the tiger&#146;s soul almost burst out of his body. In fear of his life he fled away as fast as he could. Hardly a second later that huge tiger had reached a distant forest and camouflaged his body. Seeing the extent of the tiger&#146;s fear, Aparna burst into laughter. &ldquo;So that&#146;s the strength of a tiger,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;I can easily kill such tigers with my catapult. If my brother were here he would have certainly cut off its tail and said, &lsquo;Sister, take this tail and put it in the museum.&rsquo;&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->All that riding on the deer&#146;s back had made Aparna very tired and even though it was still evening her eyes drooped sleepily. But before she could fall asleep she was startled by a frightful sound. She opened her eyes and saw a group of ghosts sitting on the branches around her.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->Some of the ghosts had horns like East Indian cows, some like Rajasthani cows, some like South Indian cows, some like deer&#146;s antlers and some like wild buffalo. Their teeth were quite different from human canine teeth. Each ghost had two long teeth which protruded out of their mouths. On closer scrutiny Aparna saw that each tooth had a hole through its middle, making it look like the hypodermic syringe doctors use to draw blood. Using the same process these ghosts would suck blood from the human body, just as vampires do. That&#146;s why they had such teeth.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->Needless to say, their feet were twisted around and their toes were pointing behind:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..34"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->Their feet were twisted around,<br>Their toes were pointing behind,<br>Their strange gestures and sound<br>Put a shiver up the spine.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->All the ghosts were laughing and making faces. They spread out their hands and feet to show Aparna they had fingers and toes just like her. And to make it quite clear they hadn&#146;t eaten for many days, they exposed their hollow stomachs, which were almost touching their spines! The female ghosts were the most terrifying of them all as they bared their teeth like monkeys. And don&#146;t forget, they were women! They were wearing ornaments in their noses, ear rings, long necklaces, and high-heeled shoes. Aparna looked closer and saw that they were wearing nail-polish and, as many women do, had put vermilion on their lips instead of on their foreheads. There were so many different types of ghosts: common ghosts, ghouls, brahmadaetyas<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.1.fn6"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#1.fn6">6</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->, mamdos<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.1.fn7"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#1.fn7">7</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> , one-handed ghosts, one-legged ghosts, cow ghosts, headless ghosts, fish-loving ghosts, ghosts that haunt treasure troves, female ghosts, and many more. Aparna was amused by their exaggerated, theatrical movements and began to laugh. But the ghosts sang in chorus<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..36"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;To escape the tiger you climbed in fear<br>And now we ghosts have got you near.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..37"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=37 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Don&#146;t you people have any common sense?&rdquo; asked Aparna.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..38"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=38 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;We&#146;re not people, we&#146;re ghosts!&rdquo; they exclaimed in their peculiar nasal voices.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..39"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=39 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Does being a ghost exempt you from having common sense?&rdquo; asked Aparna. &ldquo;What nonsense! A little girl has come here as your guest and you try to frighten her. It seems you aren&#146;t very civilized at all. It&#146;s obviously true what the old folk say: there is an erosion of values everywhere in today&#146;s society. Now I know it&#146;s not only the human society which is degenerating; the ghost society is doing exactly the same. Stop this unruliness and act sensibly.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..40"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=40 type=paragraph -->The older ghosts said, &ldquo;That&#146;s right, well said. The girl has spoken the truth.&rdquo; But a rather impudent ghost thought differently and sang,<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..41"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=41 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Rotten bullock&#146;s heart, din ta dina din<br>Cook up some rice and put some fresh bones in.<br>Suck all the bones dry and lick them clean<br>Until no drop of blood is seen.<br>Look at Uncle Mamdo in the bushes over there<br>Picking ticks and lice out of all the ghosts&#146; hair.<br>Here comes the ugly ghost Shakhcunni<br>Stuffing herself with intestine chutney.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..42"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=42 type=paragraph -->The moment he said &ldquo;Shakhcunni&rdquo; a grotesque, frightfully ugly Shakhcunni ghost appeared making fearful screams. &ldquo;Who dared utter the name Shakhcunni?&rdquo; she shouted. &ldquo;I&#146;ll break that ghost&#146;s neck!&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..43"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=43 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Sister Shakhcunni, why are you angry?&rdquo; asked Aparna. &ldquo;You look as if you haven&#146;t had a bath all winter. Have you been bitten by a mad dog? Are you suffering from hydrophobia? There are so many boisterous ghosts here making such a noise,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;yet not a single ghost has the courtesy to inquire if I&#146;m tired or not.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..44"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=44 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Don&#146;t get angry, Aparna, don&#146;t get angry,&rdquo; said the head ghost. &ldquo;Before going to sleep you&#146;ll need a bed won&#146;t you?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..45"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=45 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Of course I will,&rdquo; replied Aparna. &ldquo;You bet I will.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..46"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=46 type=paragraph -->The ghosts fetched a huge, freshly-painted bed for Aparna as quickly as they could. They also brought a mattress, quilt, pillow, bolster, head pillow, pillow cover, bed cover and bed sheet.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..47"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=47 type=paragraph -->In a furious rage, the head ghost scolded all the others, &ldquo;You&#146;re so old and yet you don&#146;t have any common sense at all. Why didn&#146;t you bring a blanket for Aparna on such a cold winter&#146;s night? Go and get one immediately. I&#146;ll time you with my watch. I want to see a blanket here within a minute.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..48"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=48 type=paragraph -->On receiving the blanket Aparna went to bed but couldn&#146;t sleep due to the continuous noise made by the ghosts. &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said the head ghost, &ldquo;that&#146;s why people abuse you by calling you ghosts you behave just like ghosts! Why are you making such a noise when Aparna is here?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..49"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=49 type=paragraph -->The ghosts started weeping. &ldquo;But it&#146;s our job to make a noise at night.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..50"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=50 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Whether it&#146;s your job or not,&rdquo; said the head ghost, &ldquo;show a little restraint tonight.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..51"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=51 type=paragraph -->Everyone obeyed. However, Aparna still couldn&#146;t get to sleep. She asked Shakhcunni, &ldquo;Dear sister, could you do me a favour?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..52"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=52 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;What favour?&rdquo; answered Shakhcunni. &ldquo;If I&#146;m able to, of course I will.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..53"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=53 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Could you please tell me a story?&rdquo; requested Aparna. Shakhcunni caressed Aparna&#146;s head and told the following story.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..54"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=54 type=paragraph -->Once-upon-a-time there was a king who lived in a huge palace. There was a large gate in front of the palace which had its own clock tower. The king had two wives, Queen Shuyo and Queen Duyo. Queen Shuyo was very wicked. Not only that, she was arrogant and greedy. In a nutshell, she was a shrew. On the other hand, Queen Duyo was a saintly person; trickery and deceit were unknown to her. With a smiling face she would help everyone. If ever anyone got short tempered with her she would smile and say, &ldquo;May I know why you are angry with me? Please tell me what I&#146;ve done wrong so that I can rectify myself.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..55"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=55 type=paragraph -->One day Queen Duyo was making a potato curry. She had used salt, oil, chilli and other spices in the exact proportions. However, the wicked Queen Shuyo threw a huge amount of chilli and salt into the pot, and then complained to the king, &ldquo;Your Majesty, just see how cunning Duyo is. She has intentionally put too much salt and chilli into the curry to make it impossible for you to eat a single mouthful.&rdquo; At first the king didn&#146;t believe her, so she said, &ldquo;Why don&#146;t you taste it for yourself? That will remove any doubt from your mind.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..56"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=56 type=paragraph -->The king tasted it. It was true. Everything Shuyo had said was true. The potato curry had been poisoned with too much salt and chilli. &ldquo;Why don&#146;t you give that idiot Duyo a good kick and drive her out of the gate?&rdquo; advised the queen. By that time the king&#146;s temper was beginning to simmer. On hearing Shuyo&#146;s words it boiled over and he threw Queen Duyo out of the gate.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..57"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=57 type=paragraph -->One day, a long time after that incident, the king was going for his early morning walk near a wood. After a while he came to a cottage and saw Queen Duyo sitting outside. She was putting coconut sweets in beautiful multi-coloured cane baskets. After being driven out of the palace she had passed her days walking to the market and selling her homemade coconut sweets.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..58"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=58 type=paragraph -->On seeing the colourful baskets the king took a fancy to them. &ldquo;Duyo, where did you buy those cane baskets?&rdquo; he asked.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..59"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=59 type=paragraph -->Queen Duyo smiled and looked at the king. &ldquo;Hello, my dear,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You&#146;ve come. It&#146;s been such a long time since I saw you. How are you?

It would be better to block my ears than to hear you say this. Are you my husband? It&#146;s my duty to serve you, to look after you, to make you constantly happy. I&#146;ve been so miserable since you drove me out of the gate because I haven&#146;t been able to serve you at all. I couldn&#146;t do my duty.

<a name="1..68"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=68 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;That&#146;s a good idea,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;Whenever I sit on my throne to do my kingly duties, the sight of those cane baskets will remind me of Duyo.

<a name="1..69"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=69 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Bring me all eight,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Shall I send someone to fetch them?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..70"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=70 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;I&#146;ll have to pick them up from the market anyway,&rdquo; said the queen, &ldquo;so I can just as well deliver them myself.

<a name="1..71"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=71 type=paragraph -->The king stood up. &ldquo;Why are you going so soon?&rdquo; asked Queen Duyo. &ldquo;You must be tired after walking so far. Rest a little more.&rdquo; The king sat down again.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..72"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=72 type=paragraph -->Queen Duyo served him a plate of homemade coconut sweets flavoured with cardamom and camphor. After eating them the king felt quite satisfied. &ldquo;Could I have one or two more?&rdquo; he asked.<!-- /block --></p>

He mouthed the words a few times, but no sound came out.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..75"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=75 type=paragraph -->At eight that evening Queen Duyo arrived at the palace gates carrying the colourful cane baskets on her head.

<a name="1..76"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=76 type=paragraph -->The gate-keeper gave the baskets to the king and told him what Duyo had said.

<a name="1..77"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=77 type=paragraph -->While he was silently admiring the baskets, Shuyo entered the room. &ldquo;Oh king, where on earth did you find those ugly baskets?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Have you taken leave of your senses? Have you gone mad at such a young age? Today I heard you had a very enjoyable chat with Duyo and told each other many funny stories. What a scandal! In my house there are so many delicious sweets, yet you still go to Duyo&#146;s house like a tramp to stuff coconut sweets into your mouth. I think you&#146;ve definitely gone mad. Here, take this rope and pitcher and drown yourself in the Ganges. Who gave you these ugly baskets?&rdquo; The king&#146;s lips trembled in fear. &ldquo;Hurry up, say something,&rdquo; shouted the queen, &ldquo; or else I&#146;ll give you a big thrashing.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="1..80"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=80 type=paragraph -->The next morning Queen Shuyo stayed in bed. Her voice was quite feeble and she could hardly move.

From time to time she also ate almond barfi, a little rabri and a few sor&#x301;baja-sorpuriya sweets from Krishnanagar. Due to her illness she could hardly eat anything at all! She had to almost force herself to eat the date sugar sandesh<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.1.fn9"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#1.fn9">9</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> and somehow managed to eat five kilos of it, thanks to the king&#146;s repeated pleas.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="1..82"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=82 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Shuyo, you shouldn&#146;t say such a thing,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You&#146;ll get well. I&#146;ll call the best doctors. Tell me exactly what you&#146;re suffering from.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..83"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=83 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Oh, it&#146;s a fatal disease,&rdquo; she said faintly. &ldquo;It&#146;s never been seen anywhere else in the whole world.

<a name="1..84"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=84 type=paragraph -->Queen Shuyo turned on her right side and immediately all her bones rattled from the top of her head to the tip of her toes.

<a name="1..85"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=85 type=paragraph -->Many well-known physicians visited the patient and set up all kinds of apparatus to examine her but were unable to diagnose the disease. Several eminent homoeopaths also came and prescribed sweet globules, but none of them proved to be very effective. A number of ayurvedic doctors paid her a visit, too. They checked her pulse and phlegm, and the functioning of her nervous and circulatory systems, but also failed to come to a conclusion. They administered anupa&#x301;n<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.1.fn11"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#1.fn11">11</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->, makaradhvaja<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.1.fn12"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#1.fn12">12</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  and a number of tablets to be taken either with betel stem juice, burnt goat-stool ash or medicinal paste<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.1.fn13"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#1.fn13">13</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> However, her condition stayed the same.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..86"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=86 type=paragraph -->Concluding that the disease was in its last stage, the doctors declared, &ldquo;The patient should be allowed to eat whatever she wants. There shouldn&#146;t be any restrictions at the last hour.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..87"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=87 type=paragraph -->On hearing these words the king wailed loudly. The queen&#146;s attendants fell on their knees and sobbed, &ldquo;Dear queen, what has happened to you? Oh, where are you going now? There is no one whose kindness can compare with yours.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..88"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=88 type=paragraph -->The king summoned all the reputable confectioners and said, &ldquo;Send us your best quality sweets.

<a name="1..89"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=89 type=paragraph -->Whenever she laid eyes on the king Queen Shuyo would taunt, &ldquo;How many dozen baskets did Duyo send here?

<a name="1..90"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=90 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;How do you feel now?&rdquo; asked the king.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="1..92"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=92 type=paragraph -->The king observed that Shuyo was fatter than she had ever been. She looked like a huge drum, but he couldn&#146;t tell her that. Out of fear he said, &ldquo;My dear, you&#146;ve been reduced to a few bones. I can hardly bear to look at you.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..93"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=93 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Do you really want to save me?&rdquo; she asked.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="1..95"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=95 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Then listen,&rdquo; said the queen. &ldquo;There&#146;s a big forest about five miles away from here which is thick with palm trees. No one can walk a single stop into the forest because it&#146;s full of enormous Royal Bengal tigers. One tiger can devour two hundred people at a time.

<a name="1..96"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=96 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;And then, and then?&rdquo; asked the king.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..97"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=97 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;There is a huge lake in the middle of the forest,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;which is covered with water weeds and hyacinths.

<a name="1..98"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=98 type=paragraph -->Said the king, &ldquo;I will immediately send out the town-crier to inform everyone that whoever can fetch a pitcher of water from that lake in the dead of night will be rewarded with caskets full of gold and riches from the royal treasury.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..99"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=99 type=paragraph -->The next morning an announcement was made to the beating of the drum that all the gold and riches from the royal treasury would be given to any brave person who could bring water from the tiger infested jungle in the dead of night.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..100"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=100 type=paragraph -->The greed of attaining all those riches slowly crept into the minds of the people, but in fear of their lives nobody volunteered. They whispered to each other,<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="1..102"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=102 type=paragraph -->No one was willing to try. With tears streaming down his cheeks the king entered the queen&#146;s room. &ldquo;Shuyo, I will die before you do,&rdquo; he wept. &ldquo;I won&#146;t let you perish in this way, slowly, under my nose. Not a single person has volunteered. What should I do?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..103"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=103 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;But you are so eloquent in praising Duyo,&rdquo; answered the queen. &ldquo;People say there isn&#146;t such a kind-hearted person as her anywhere else in the world.

If she refuses, I&#146;ll shave her head, pour buttermilk on her and parade her around the town on a donkey&#146;s back.

<a name="1..104"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=104 type=paragraph -->The king rushed over to Duyo&#146;s house. How could he possibly tell her about going to the tiger-infested forest?

<a name="1..105"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=105 type=paragraph -->In the late evening Queen Duyo went to dine at the palace.

<a name="1..110"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=110 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;What advice is there to give&rdquo; asked Duyo. &ldquo;I&#146;ll go myself.

<a name="1..111"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=111 type=paragraph -->The king gave Duyo a brass pitcher and a round container full of betel leaves. Chewing on a mouthful of betel, Duyo placed the pitcher on her hip and set off in the direction of the forest.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="1..113"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=113 type=paragraph -->Doing a double march, Duyo quickly reached the forest. She marched inside, trampling the ground under her feet.

<a name="1..120"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=120 type=paragraph -->Queen Duyo marched on as quickly as her feet would carry her. After travelling a long way she spotted the huge lake full of water, weeds and hyacinths in the forest gloom. When she finally reached its banks she was jubilant.

Whenever she would turn on one side the sticks would make a rattling sound, and whenever she would turn on the other side they would also rattle. Therefore everyone in the town believed her and took it for granted that she was afflicted with the bone-rattling disease. How could the doctors diagnose such a disease?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..125"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=125 type=paragraph -->After gleefully singing song after song on the banks of the lake, Queen Duyo dozed off to sleep.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="1..130"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=130 type=paragraph -->After a short snooze beside the lake Queen Duyo woke up. She felt immensely peaceful and overjoyed because Queen Shuyo would certainly be cured. Oh what joy! what joy! what joy! Then she suddenly remembered that the water had to be taken in the dead of night. So she climbed down into the lake and searched for the pitcher with outstretched arms. But she couldn&#146;t find it! It was under the hyacinths beneath the water-weeds and concealed some where in the mud. She swam on her front, on her back and even under the water, but was unable to find the pitcher. She was so sad; her heart was bursting with grief. &ldquo;Oh Parama Purus&#x301;a,&rdquo; she sobbed, &ldquo;Won&#146;t I be able to cure Shuyo&#146;s disease?

<a name="1..133"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=133 type=paragraph -->Hearing her firm steps and loud voice the rest of the tigers stayed rooted in fear to the spots where they were crouching. Queen Duyo marched forwards quickly. Sometimes her left foot hit a tiger&#146;s back, and sometimes her right foot hit a tiger&#146;s back. But the tigers were all paralysed Queen Duyo marched on and on. She was overcome with joy because now Queen Shuyo would be cured and the king would smile with delight.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..134"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=134 type=paragraph -->Luckily it was still night when Duyo arrived back in the town with the tiger so there was no one in sight. Had the townsfolk seen the tiger they would have run in all directions out of fear. So Queen Duyo marched on unhindered and reached the main gate of the palace. The gate-keeper was holding his gun against his shoulder, standing with his feet wide apart and snoring loudly. He was fast asleep. Duyo slipped through the gate and quickly walked into Shuyo&#146;s room. By that time all the doctors and nurses had left. Queen Duyo placed the tiger firmly on the ground, looked at Queen Shuyo and said,<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..135"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=135 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;I&#146;ll leave your pitcher here<br>And your water too.<br>I really must get going<br>There&#146;s so much work to do.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..136"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=136 type=paragraph -->Queen Duyo arrived back at her modest home before dawn and started making coconut sweets. Early in the morning she would have to sell them in the market.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..137"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=137 type=paragraph -->The tiger had been paralysed with fear and apprehension. When Duyo placed him violently on the ground his teeth clenched and he became senseless. Some time later, when the golden light of the dawn shone through the window onto his face, he came back to his senses. Opening his eyes, he saw an extremely fat lady lying on the bed in front of him. She must have weighed as much as ten elephants. How could he miss such an opportunity? In one leap he ripped Shuyo&#146;s head and neck from her body, and in another leap landed outside the window. And then he fled away as fast as his legs would carry him. Queen Shuyo&#146;s mortal life was over.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..138"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=138 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Sister Shakhcunni, what happened to Queen Shuyo after she died?&rdquo; asked Aparna.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..139"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=139 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Well, she committed a lot of sins,&rdquo; replied Shakhcunni, &ldquo;and therefore became a grotesquely ugly Shakhcunni ghost after death. The king was basically a good man, but due to the bad influence of Shuyo did many terrible things. He became a one-handed ghost and now lives in that palm tree over there. Queen Duyo was a saintly person &ndash; such people are very rare &ndash; and went to heaven where she now eats basketful after basketful of coconut sweets.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..140"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=140 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;So where is that ugly Shakhcunni now?&rdquo; asked Aparna.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="1..142"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=142 type=paragraph -->Night was coming to an end and Aparna was woken up by the birds&#146; dawn chorus. Shakhcunni and the other ghosts advised her again and again, &ldquo;When you arrive at the demon kingdom, your every step must be taken cautiously.&rdquo; Ugly Shakhcunni tied a few chocolates and lozenges into her handkerchief and said, &ldquo;Suck these while you walk.&rdquo; The other ghosts said, &ldquo;The demons are horrible. The strong ones oppress the weak and even snatch their food from their mouths. No one trusts anyone else; they all suspect each other. You&#146;ll never see a smile on their wretched faces, because they are forbidden to smile. They&#146;re nothing but chickens.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..143"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=143 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Think about Parama Purus&#x301;a all the time,&rdquo; advised Shakhcunni. &ldquo;Don&#146;t make anyone angry unnecessarily.

<a name="1..144"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=144 type=paragraph -->Aparna walked into the southern part of the forest. She walked on and on and suddenly heard a kot kot kotakot, kot kot kotakot sound. &ldquo;Let me go and see what that is,&rdquo; she thought, but then decided, &ldquo;Well it probably isn&#146;t anything interesting; a woodman must be cutting wood.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..145"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=145 type=paragraph -->After going a little further she heard a kot kot kona kon, kot kot kona kon sound a little way off.

<a name="1..146"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=146 type=paragraph -->She continued her journey, and soon came to a stream. Its dancing transparent waters looked so beautiful that she cupped her hands and drank. She heard a gentle murmuring and wondered what it was. &ldquo;It&#146;s quite natural for rivers to make such sounds,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;so what&#146;s the point of bothering about it?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..147"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=147 type=paragraph -->A little farther south the forest came to an end and Aparna found herself on the edge of a vast plain. The soil was completely dry and as hard as rock. The only trees she could see were some very tall coconut trees. But there wasn&#146;t a single ripe coconut on any of them, only unripe ones. &ldquo;This is very strange,&rdquo; thought Aparna.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..148"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=148 type=paragraph -->Aparna noticed that the people who lived there weren&#146;t talking with each other. In fact they hardly looked at each other. They were only concerned about their own affairs. Aparna saw a little girl like herself beside the road and asked, &ldquo;Sister, would you like a chocolate?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..149"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=149 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Why do you want to give me a chocolate?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;I bet you&#146;ve poisoned it.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..150"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=150 type=paragraph -->Aparna was amazed. She ate half the chocolate herself and said, &ldquo;Look, if this chocolate was poisoned would I eat half of it myself?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..151"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=151 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;All right, please give me a chocolate,&rdquo; said the demon girl. &ldquo;But first eat a little piece of it yourself,&rdquo; she added suspiciously.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..152"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=152 type=paragraph -->Aparna was astonished. She gave the little girl a chocolate, and asked, &ldquo;Why is this place so dry? There&#146;s nothing growing here except a few coconut trees and they only have unripe coconuts on them. That&#146;s very strange.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..153"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=153 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;It&#146;s a long story,&rdquo; replied the demon girl. &ldquo;There is a garden beside the demon king&#146;s royal palace where many vegetables used to grow, including a rather unusual eggplant. One day we noticed the eggplant had grown five feet in a single night. Having never seen such a strange thing, we could hardly believe our eyes. The top officials of the agriculture department went to see for themselves but couldn&#146;t give any explanation at all. Muttering this and that they tried to hide their ignorance.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..154"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=154 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;&lsquo;It seems I sent you overseas to get your degrees in vain,&rsquo; lamented the demon king. &lsquo;Neither have you learnt anything, nor have you understood anything.&rsquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..155"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=155 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;&lsquo;Good heavens!&rsquo; exclaimed the officials. &lsquo;How do you expect us to solve this mystery with the little knowledge we acquired studying overseas all those years ago? The standard of education abroad has since greatly improved and if you were to send us there now we&#146;d be able to give you the correct answer.&rsquo; Disgusted, the demon king returned home.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..156"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=156 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;One day the eggplant grew an extra ten feet, the next day twenty feet. It kept growing until it was about to touch the sky and its roots were about to penetrate the underworld. Moreover, every day it produced thousands and thousands of tons of different types of eggplants: deep black egg-plants, American red egg-plants, Chinese white egg-plants, long egg-plants, thorny egg-plants and giant eggplants. Some were sweet, some sour, some salty, some pungent, some astringent and some bitter.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..157"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=157 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;That huge eggplant which stretched from the sky down to the underworld made a gurgling sound as it sucked the earth dry. The water-table sank lower and lower until it was finally beyond reach. Without water all the plants withered and died. The situation was much worse than in any coal-mining area. All the ponds dried up: women had nowhere to get water, bathing became impossible and farming stopped.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..158"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=158 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Fortunately the plant produces a lot of egg-plants which we eat to survive. They are out of reach and have to be pulled down to the ground with a long pole.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..159"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=159 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;How do you cook without water?&rdquo; asked Aparna.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..160"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=160 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Luckily there are unripe coconuts on the coconut trees,&rdquo; replied the demon girl. &ldquo;We use their water for cooking, rinsing our mouths, drinking and bathing. That&#146;s why we don&#146;t let a single coconut ripen  they are all picked when they are still unripe. The coconut water is taken to the waterworks where it is filtered and then piped to people&#146;s homes. On the king&#146;s orders meters have been installed to extract charges and reduce wastage.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..161"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=161 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;And then?&rdquo; asked Aparna.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..162"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=162 type=paragraph -->The demon girl continued, &ldquo;The king announced that anyone who could cut down the eggplant and raise the water level would be given half the kingdom and the right to order the release of all the prisoners in the jail.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..163"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=163 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Why do people go to jail?&rdquo; asked Aparna.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..164"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=164 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Because they commit crimes,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Some due to a faulty education, some out of poverty, and some due to their inborn nature. By giving a good education to everyone satiety could make its citizens just and honest. However, no one in our present society has the necessary knowledge, intelligence or concern to do that. So what can people do? Because they cannot do good, they resort to bad actions. Then they are thrown into prison where they mix with dishonest people. They become even more corrupted and finally choose the path of the demons. Our society is now full of them.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..165"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=165 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;The king announced that those who are unsuccessful in cutting down the eggplant will be thrown into prison and their ears and noses cut off. Actually, only the men have to face this punishment; the women are not dealt with in such a way. If they are unsuccessful they have to wear ear-rings in their noses and nose-rings in their ears.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..166"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=166 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;I&#146;ll have a go,&rdquo; said Aparna. &ldquo;I&#146;ll go and try.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..167"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=167 type=paragraph -->She went to the demon king and said, &ldquo;Your Majesty, I would also like to try. Please give me permission.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..168"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=168 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;You can try if you so desire,&rdquo; he told her, &ldquo;but I know you won&#146;t succeed.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..169"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=169 type=paragraph -->The water is too deep<br>For elephants and horses<br>But the mosquito says,<br>&ldquo;It&#146;s not too deep for me.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..170"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=170 type=paragraph -->Aparna struck one of the branches of the eggplant with an axe. Of course it fell to the ground, but immediately a thousand other branches grew out of the same place. Then she struck one of the roots and severed it, but from that spot thousands of roots grew out in an instant.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..171"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=171 type=paragraph -->The demon king&#146;s guards seized Aparna and threw her into jail. Needless to say, she was forced to wear ear-rings in her nose and nose-rings in her ears. The black shadow of doom descended on her life.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..172"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=172 type=paragraph -->Prisoners in the demon jail had to spend the whole day locked up, but at night the gates were left open and they were free to go anywhere they liked. However, no one would leave the prison. The demons used to pose as innocent citizens during the day, but would become bloodsuckers at night. That&#146;s why the prisoners preferred to stay confined to the jail. If they ventured outside they would surely fall into the clutches of the demons. Aparna sat in the inky darkness of her cell. While wondering what to do next she noticed many different types of owl perched on the branch of a drumstick tree just outside her cell window.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..173"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=173 type=paragraph -->Most birds cannot see at night and take shelter in their own nests. Owls and a few other varieties of birds, however, are unable to see during the day and can only see at night. There are many species of owl: the brown fish owl, the barn owl, the northern spotted owlet, the Indian brown hawk owl, the graveyard owl, and many more. The northern spotted owlet is the only one which can see in the late afternoon. The others can only see after sunset. Owls eat more flesh than birds. They are quite cowardly during the day, but become brave at night.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..174"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=174 type=paragraph -->When she saw these owls, Aparna remembered ugly Shakhcunni&#146;s parting words. She gave one of her chocolates to a brown fish owl. The owl ate it without any hesitation. &ldquo;Brother fish owl, brother fish owl,&rdquo; said Aparna, &ldquo;you ate the chocolate as soon as I gave it to you. Didn&#146;t it occur to you that it might be something bad?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..175"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=175 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Why would I think that?&rdquo; replied the owl. &ldquo;When people give things with affection, would they, or could they, give anything harmful?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..176"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=176 type=paragraph -->Aparna thought, &ldquo;Oh, just see how different this owl is from the demon girl.&rdquo; Having given the chocolate to the owl she mentally summoned Ugly Shakhcunni. &ldquo;Sister Shakhcunni, I&#146;m in great trouble.&rdquo; Shakhcunni appeared that very instant and said, &ldquo;Here I am. Don&#146;t worry. I know what trouble you&#146;re in and will do everything I can to help. Don&#146;t bother yourself about it. Go to sleep.&rdquo; Just as she was about to leave she added, &ldquo;By the way, my dear, you made a small mistake. Instead of calling me &lsquo;Sister Shakhcunni&rsquo;, you should have called me &lsquo;Grotesquely Ugly Sister Shakhcunni&rsquo;. After all, I&#146;m a very bad person, you know.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="1..177"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=177 type=paragraph -->Anumay had gone to Purulia to participate in a sports competition. It was expected that he would stay there for a few days. The first night passed uneventfully, but during the second night his sleep was suddenly broken.

<a name="1..180"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=180 type=paragraph -->Anumay looked around and saw Ugly Shakhcunni standing beside him.

<a name="1..181"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=181 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;You shouldn&#146;t stay in Purulia any longer,&rdquo; whispered Shakhcunni. &ldquo;Aparna has fallen into the clutches of the demons and I need your help to rescue her.

<a name="1..183"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=183 type=paragraph -->So Anumay turned south. While looking towards the forest he felt as if he was being drawn by some inexplicable attraction. He was not sure what caused him to move like one entranced, as if in a dream. He was aware, however, of the forest leaves quivering in the breeze, softly murmuring. The quivering charmed him, but he was unable to explain why. He did realize that nothing in this universe is meaningless, nothing is burdensome, nothing is valueless.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="1..188"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=188 type=paragraph -->Dusk was drawing in. The forest was unknown, unfamiliar. To the left and right, in front and behind, in all directions, he peered into dense darkness. &ldquo;Wait here,&rdquo; whispered Shakhcunni. &ldquo;A deer is coming.

<a name="1..189"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=189 type=paragraph -->After a short while, a huge deer approached and stood beside Anumay. He jumped on her back, and she set off.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..190"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=190 type=paragraph -->After travelling a short distance they met a king cobra coming from the deep forest. &ldquo;Brother king cobra, do you work here?&rdquo; asked Anumay.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..191"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=191 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Yes, I&#146;m on duty here,&rdquo; replied the cobra. &ldquo;It&#146;s my job to check passports and visas.

<a name="1..192"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=192 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;I&#146;m a citizen of this forest,&rdquo; said the deer. &ldquo;I don&#146;t need a passport or a visa.&rdquo; The cobra was satisfied, said goodbye and left.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..193"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=193 type=paragraph -->They crossed the checkpost and walked on a little further. All of a sudden a huge Royal Bengal tiger emerged from the bushes and started creeping towards them very slowly. He was thinking how nice it would be to have his first kill so early in the night. &ldquo;I&#146;ve got two tasty dishes in one catch,&rdquo; he thought.

<a name="1..197"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=197 type=paragraph -->Anumay answered in a stern voice,<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="1..200"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=200 type=paragraph -->After a while Anumay and the deer reached an arjuna tree. Nestled in its branches Anumay saw Aparna&#146;s bed and bedding just where she had left them. Anumay climbed up the tree and was surprised to find a number of ghosts, ghouls and mamdos sitting on the branches, looking as if they were waiting for him. Ugly Shakhcunni had already given them instructions: &ldquo;As Anumay is in great trouble you&#146;d better be on your best behaviour.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="1..208"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=208 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;This is a lame excuse,&rdquo; thought Kablakanta. &ldquo;They&#146;ve really come here to steal the pond. To uproot a tree you have to first dig away the soil around it and then pull it up slowly. They&#146;re using a similar technique. First they&#146;ll dig away the soil around the pond and then they&#146;ll lift up the whole pond and carry it away. What a terrible thing. If they steal it how will we bathe, cook food and drink water? There won&#146;t be any more fish. How will we eat fish with our rice? No, we&#146;ll never allow the theft of the pond to occur like this in broad daylight.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..209"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=209 type=paragraph -->Kablakanta held five street-corner meetings every day.

<a name="1..210"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=210 type=paragraph -->Everyone who gathered to hear Kablakanta&#146;s speeches returned home in fits of laughter.

<a name="1..231"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=231 type=paragraph -->Once upon a time there was a famous and respected king called Kulabanta Singh. His personality was so awesome that in his kingdom cows and tigers would drink from the same pond. Six-foot tall gate-keepers, dressed in glamorous uniforms and sporting giant moustaches, stood on guard at the palace gates. The head gatekeeper was called Kushabanta Singh. One day while keeping guard at the main gate, a gun propped against his shoulder, Kushabanta Singh spotted the palace laundryman, Chabbyulal Rajak. He was pushing a hand-cart full of bundles of clothes and, surprisingly, had shaved his head. Kushabanta Singh thought,<!-- /block --></p>

Chabbyulal burst into tears. &ldquo;Haven&#146;t you heard?&rdquo; he sobbed. &ldquo;In my neighbourhood everyone&#146;s weeping; tears are pouring from their eyes.

<a name="1..234"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=234 type=paragraph -->Kushabanta Singh had no idea who Gandharba Singh was; he had not even heard the name before.

<a name="1..289"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=289 type=paragraph -->Replied Chabbyulal, &ldquo;Right now all the people in my neighbourhood are weeping day and night. Due to Gandharba Singh&#146;s untimely death their chests are bursting with grief. We could never have imagined that Gandharba Singh would pass away.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..290"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=290 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; consoled the king. &ldquo;We are also grief-stricken. Gandharba Singh has gone leaving us in an ocean of sorrow. Out of grief we have shaved our heads. We are ready to shave them a thousand times if necessary &ndash; but I want to know who he was exactly.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..291"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=291 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Your Majesty,&rdquo; replied Chabbyulal, &ldquo;it is indeed a great loss. No loss can be greater than this. What else can I tell you about him? Gandharba Singh was the name of my dearest, my most beloved donkey. In his absence I&#146;ve been pulling my laundry cart around myself today.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..292"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=292 type=paragraph -->[end of section that was printed separately as &ldquo;Gandharba Singh Is No More&rdquo;]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..293"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=293 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Gandharba Singh was quite famous when he was alive,&rdquo; said the head-ghost, &ldquo;but even more famous after death. His name has been permanently recorded in the annals of history. After dying he became a donkey ghost and came to live with us here. Donkey ghosts are by nature a little shy and rarely show themselves. That&#146;s why he stays behind that banyan tree over there making a munch munch sound as he eats grass and a crunch crunch sound as he walks around. So that&#146;s what those munch munch and crunch crunch sounds are.&rdquo; Anumay fell asleep.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..294"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=294 type=paragraph -->Just before dawn Anumay climbed down the tree and washed his hands and feet. He was almost ready to set off when ugly Shakhcunni offered him breakfast. &ldquo;Eat it before you leave,&rdquo; she advised. &ldquo;You know, when you go to a foreign country you can never be sure where or what you&#146;ll be able to eat.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..295"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=295 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Anumay, &ldquo;but it&#146;s too early to eat anything. I&#146;d prefer to go straight away.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..296"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=296 type=paragraph -->So Anumay set off. After walking south for a long time he heard an incessant kot kot kotakot, kot kot kotakot sound coming from within the deep forest. &ldquo;Let me go and see what that is,&rdquo; he thought, but then decided against it. &ldquo;No, while travelling one shouldn&#146;t make any detours; otherwise one may forget one&#146;s destination.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..297"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=297 type=paragraph -->But just at that moment ugly Shakhcunni whispered in his ear, &ldquo;Go and take a look, it&#146;ll be to your advantage.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..298"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=298 type=paragraph -->After walking a little way Anumay saw an axe cutting off the branches of a tree. Branches were falling everywhere. He inquired,<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..299"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=299 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Oh brother axe, for whom are you waiting<br>Alone in the vast forest?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..300"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=300 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Anumay, you&#146;ve come,&rdquo; replied the axe. &ldquo;I&#146;ve been waiting a long time for you to come by this way. I&#146;m Ugly Shakhcunni&#146;s axe. It&#146;s my job to help good people as much as I can. Put me in your bag. I&#146;ll be very useful.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..301"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=301 type=paragraph -->Anumay put the axe in his bag and set off once again on his journey. After walking a little way he heard a kot kot kona kon, kot kot kona kon sound. This time, before he could even think about it, ugly Shakhcunni whispered, &ldquo;Go and investigate, it&#146;ll be helpful to you.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..302"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=302 type=paragraph -->After walking a little further he saw a pick-axe digging away at the rocky earth and inquired,<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..303"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=303 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Oh brother pick-axe, for whom are you waiting<br>Alone in the vast forest?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..304"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=304 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Anumay, you&#146;ve come,&rdquo; replied the pick-axe. &ldquo;I&#146;ve been waiting for you. I work for Ugly Shakhcunni. It&#146;s my job to help good people in all circumstances. Put me in your bag. I&#146;ll be very useful.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..305"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=305 type=paragraph -->Anumay put the pick-axe in his bag and set off once again. After a while he reached a small stream. While he was drinking its waters with cupped hands, a murmuring sound drifted into his ears. &ldquo;Should I go and find out where that murmuring sound is coming from?&rdquo; he asked himself. And then ugly Shakhcunni whispered in his ear, &ldquo;Yes, go and see. It will be helpful to you.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..306"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=306 type=paragraph -->After walking upstream a little way Anumay saw a red pumpkin. The stream was murmuring as it flowed out of a hole in the pumpkin. Anumay inquired,<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..307"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=307 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Oh brother pumpkin, for whom are you waiting<br>Alone in the vast forest?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..308"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=308 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Anumay, you&#146;ve come,&rdquo; replied the pumpkin. &ldquo;I&#146;ve been waiting for you. I&#146;m Ugly Shakhcunni&#146;s pumpkin. It&#146;s my job to render all kinds of service to good people. Put me in your bag. I&#146;ll be very useful.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..309"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=309 type=paragraph -->Anumay blocked the hole with wax, put the pumpkin in his bag and set off on his journey once again. After a while the forest opened onto a vast plain which stretched as far as the eye could see. Above was the blue sky; below, the stony, dusty, dry soil. Anumay noticed that there was no vegetation except a row of tall coconut trees that bore only unripe coconuts.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..310"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=310 type=paragraph -->He also noticed that everyone&#146;s hair looked very untidy. They obviously hadn&#146;t oiled it for quite some time. How could they have used oil anyway? Coconut oil is made from ripe coconuts and here the coconuts had to be picked before they were ripe to solve the water problem. Not a single one was given the chance to ripen. &ldquo;They could easily use mustard oil in their hair,&rdquo; thought Anumay. Then he realized that all farming had stopped due to a lack of water. If they couldn&#146;t grow mustard plants they certainly couldn&#146;t produce mustard oil. They kept a few cows, which they fed with imported cattle feed, so were able to produce milk and ghee. But ghee can&#146;t be used to oil the hair! After making a few inquiries, Anumay discovered that people who used to put mustard oil in their nostrils and sleep the whole day were now greatly inconvenienced because they had to use ghee instead.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..311"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=311 type=paragraph -->Anumay walked a little further and came to a fork in the road. While he was puzzling over which route to take ugly Shakhcunni whispered in his ear, &ldquo;Take the road on the right. The demon king&#146;s palace is that way.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..312"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=312 type=paragraph -->When he reached the palace he read the large notice about the eggplant: whoever could cut down the tree and raise the water level would be given half the kingdom. Moreover that person would earn the right to order the release of all the prisoners. Once again he remembered the warning given by ugly Shakhcunni and the other ghosts as he was climbing down the tree: &ldquo;The demons are dangerous. The strong oppress the weak and even snatch the food from their mouths. Be very careful, Anumay.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..313"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=313 type=paragraph -->Anumay had already made up his mind to be careful. He went to the royal court to meet the king. Bowing low according to protocol, he said, &ldquo;Your Majesty, kindly give me permission to cut down the eggplant.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..314"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=314 type=paragraph -->Said the demon king mockingly, &ldquo;I see you wish to go to jail and have your nose and ears chopped off. Go back home and drink milk with a bowl and spoon like all little boys.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..315"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=315 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Your Majesty,&rdquo; persisted Anumay, &ldquo;I&#146;m too old to drink milk with a bowl and spoon. I&#146;m almost ten,&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..316"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=316 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Since you&#146;re so arrogant,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;go and try.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..317"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=317 type=paragraph -->Anumay stood beside the tree to assess the task before him. He took the axe out of the bag and said, &ldquo;Brother axe, brother axe, get to work.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..318"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=318 type=paragraph -->The axe made such a deafening kot kot kotakot, kot kot kotakot sound as it cut the tree that it shook the earth, air and sky. Thousands of branches were flying in all directions, blacking out the sky and causing the day to become as dark as night. Everyone started running in all directions, shouting, &ldquo;Oh my god! save yourselves, run for your lives.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..319"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=319 type=paragraph -->In order to find out what was going on the demon king rushed out of his palace and headed in the direction of the eggplant. The route was treacherous &ndash; many huge branches flew into his ears and nostrils. So he ran back to the palace, shouting, &ldquo;Save me! Save me!&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..320"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=320 type=paragraph -->At first he hid himself under the dining table, but even there it was not safe. He was bombarded on all sides by hundreds of eggplants of various sizes and colours: deep black eggplants, American red eggplants, Chinese white eggplants, long eggplants, thorny eggplants and giant eggplants. On being badly wounded in the face by a volley of thorny eggplants he had no other option than to jump into an empty rice sack and somehow save his life.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..321"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=321 type=paragraph -->Within a few minutes the axe had cut down the whole tree, thus solving the first problem. But how could the water level be raised? The earth had become as hard as stone. &ldquo;Brother pickaxe, brother pickaxe, get to work,&rdquo; said Anumay. Five minutes later the pickaxe had dug a huge lake bed out of the rock-hard earth.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..322"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=322 type=paragraph -->The lake bed had been dug, but where would the water come from? The water table had sunk below the underworld. Anumay took the pumpkin out of his bag, put it in the middle of the lake bed and removed the plug. &ldquo;Brother pumpkin, brother pumpkin, get to work,&rdquo; he said. A murmuring stream of water flowed out of the pumpkin and quickly filled the lake. It seemed, however, that the entire country was about to be flooded. People climbed to the tops of the coconut trees to save their lives. The rich left the ground floor of their homes and took refuge on the first floor.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..323"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=323 type=paragraph -->When the danger had passed everyone wondered where the demon king was. They searched high and low. There was no sign of him on the ground floor of the palace so they searched all the rooms on the first floor, but still couldn&#146;t find him. Then from inside a rice sack they heard his feeble cry. &ldquo;I&#146;m inside the rice sack. Come and rescue me.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..324"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=324 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;There&#146;s no need to be afraid anymore, Your Majesty,&rdquo; they said. &ldquo;The eggplant has been cut down and the water table has risen. You can come out of the sack now.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..325"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=325 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;When the tree&#146;s branches were falling everywhere,&rdquo; said the demon king, &ldquo;my body shrank in fear and it was easy for me to get into this rice sack. However, now that the eggplant has been cut, and the water table has risen, I&#146;ve become as fat as a pig, and my belly is as big as a mammoth. I&#146;m stuck so tightly in the sack that I can&#146;t even move. It&#146;s impossible for me to get out.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..326"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=326 type=paragraph -->So they cut open the jute sack with scissors and liberated the imprisoned demon king. He heaved a sigh, of relief. But remember, the demon king was very wicked. Every moment his mind was full of evil designs. He thought, &ldquo;I won&#146;t give Anumay half the kingdom, nor will I let him free the prisoners.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..327"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=327 type=paragraph -->Then Anumay arrived. &ldquo;Your Majesty,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;now you should honour your promise.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..328"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=328 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Whose promise?&rdquo; asked the king, pretending not to know. &ldquo;What promise? I certainly didn&#146;t make any promise. The eggplant withered under the blazing sun and the water-table rose due to an earthquake. What&#146;s your achievement in all this? Go home naughty boy, and drink milk with a bowl and a spoon.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..329"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=329 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Anumay, &ldquo;then it&#146;s going to be a case of tit for tat. Brother axe, brother axe, get to work.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..330"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=330 type=paragraph -->The axe started to hit the demon king&#146;s eyes and nose. Kot kot kotakot, kot kot kotakot came the sound. Just as he was about to lose one of his ears he cried out, &ldquo;I&#146;m guilty. I&#146;m at fault. I surrender. Anumay, please forgive me, please forget everything. Oh, how you must hate me.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..331"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=331 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;I can forgive you,&rdquo; said Anumay, &ldquo;But remember, I can never hate you. I can&#146;t hate anyone. I never learned how to hate.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..332"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=332 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Then just forgive me,&rdquo; said the demon king.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..333"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=333 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;But first it must be considered if you&#146;ve changed your bad ways.&rdquo; said Anumay.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..334"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=334 type=paragraph -->The demon king pleaded for mercy with folded hands and then sang one of Rabindranath Tagore&#146;s songs<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..335"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=335 type=paragraph -->I&#146;ve accepted defeat, I&#146;ve accepted defeat<br>Your defeat means my defeat<br>This I have realized times without number.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..336"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=336 type=paragraph -->Anumay was a great lover of Tagore&#146;s songs. Their noble ideas were a great source of joy for him. Now, hearing these lofty ideals from the mouth of the demon king he couldn&#146;t help but forgive him.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..337"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=337 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;I hereby give you half the kingdom and the right to free all the prisoners,&rdquo; said the demon king.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..338"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=338 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;I&#146;m still a student and a little boy.&rdquo; said Anumay. &ldquo;What would I do with half a kingdom? Either become honest and run the administration yourself, or hand it over to any honest person. I just want the right to grant the release of all the prisoners.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..339"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=339 type=paragraph -->Anumay ordered the release of all the prisoners. He made arrangements for those who had their noses and ears cut off to be given new ones using the latest techniques of medical science. On hearing the news the prisoners were overcome with joy. They rushed through the prison gates shouting, &ldquo;Victory to the human race! Victory to the kind-hearted! Victory to our little brother, Anumay.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..340"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=340 type=paragraph -->The demon king accompanied Anumay to the prison. When Aparna saw her brother, she rushed up and hugged him. &ldquo;Anumay, you&#146;re here!&rdquo; she cried. Anumay was so happy to be with his sister again that he burst into tears of joy.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..341"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=341 type=paragraph -->In due time suitable arrangements were made to send the prisoners back to their countries. A rocket was ready to give Aparna and Anumay a comfortable trip back home.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..342"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=342 type=paragraph -->While walking along the main street on their way to board the rocket Anumay and Aparna saw the demon king&#146;s elder son, Madhumay, younger son Rupamay, and only daughter, Madhupurna, waiting for them. &ldquo;Do you wish to say something, friends?&rdquo; asked Anumay.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..343"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=343 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Yes, brother Anumay,&rdquo; they replied. &ldquo;We would like to ask you a question. It will be our first and last question.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..344"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=344 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Please ask,&rdquo; said Anumay.<!-- /block --></p>

Can we go with you to the human society?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..346"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=346 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Of course you can.&rdquo; replied Anumay and Aparna. &ldquo;You can come today, right now. You are our brothers and sisters.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="1..349"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=349 type=paragraph -->Aparna and Anumay climbed into the rocket. After the take-off Anumay asked Aparna, &ldquo;Little sister, I want to know once and for all how you will address me when we get home.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..350"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=350 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Why do you want to know the same thing over and over again?&rdquo; asked Aparna. &ldquo;I&#146;ve already told you that I took a vow to only address you as a&#x301;pni.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..351"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=351 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;I don&#146;t need such respect,&rdquo; said Anumay. &ldquo;It&#146;ll be enough if you call me tumi.&rdquo; After a pause he continued, &ldquo;Look, you&#146;ve been addressing me as tui since the day you were born.
